Jon Tester of Montana asked Gensler to give the public more time to weigh in on the raft of rules the agency is proposing. The SEC's agenda includes a landmark climate risk disclosure rule for public companies, new transparency requirements for hedge funds and a revamp of the stock market's plumbing.\n The Democrats who signed the letter include: Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Gary Peters of Michigan and John Hickenlooper of Colorado.\n \"It is critical that, as the SEC moves through the rulemaking processes, there is adequate time to evaluate each individual rule as well as how those rules interact with existing and other proposed rules,\" the senators said, noting the \"significant number of separate proposed rulemakings\" on the SEC's agenda.\n A spokesperson for Tester confirmed the authenticity of the letter and its signers. Tester, Warnock, Sinema and Warner are members of the Senate Banking Committee, which handles oversight of the SEC. The agency did not immediately response to a request for comment. \n The Sept. 13 letter, which was not widely released but began circulating among lobbyists in recent days, underscores the growing tensions between Gensler and moderate Democrats on Capitol Hill at an especially contentious time for the regulator, as the agency's upcoming rules face a growing risk of litigation from industry as well as potential investigations from Republican lawmakers. \n The letter hits on what has become a growing sore point for corporate America: the length of comment periods in which the agency lets the public send feedback on proposed regulations.\n Under Gensler, the SEC has been proposing more and more rules with what critics see as unnecessarily tight public comment windows, such as 30 or 45 days.\n Republicans like Sens. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Thom Tillis of North Carolina have previously criticized the SEC chief for the short comment periods. In April, nearly four dozen members of the House, including Democrats and Republicans, wrote to Gensler with concerns about whether the comment periods for certain rules aimed at the private fund industry \"may hamper the ability for the public to provide effective and meaningful input.\" And SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, the agency's most-senior Republican official, has said that 30 days “is typically not enough time to get feedback on a rule proposal.”\n “The notice and comment process is intended to be a dialogue,” Peirce said in December. “Analyzing a multi-hundred page rule making in the context of intricate markets and an already complicated set of securities and other relevant laws is not an easy task.”\n If the SEC did opt to give more time for public feedback, it would ultimately result in the proposed market safeguards taking longer to go into effect — possibly spelling good news for corporate executives hoping to wait out Gensler for a change in administration. \n Gensler has pushed back on such concerns, saying that the law only requires the SEC to provide 30 days for comment. Even then, comment periods typically start when the proposal is published on the Federal Register, which is running on a lag of several weeks. In the meantime, comments can still be submitted to the SEC. \n The SEC chair is not the first to face pushback for short comment periods. In the Trump administration, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and the Council of Institutional Investors urged then-SEC Chair Jay Clayton for more time than 60 days to comment on a slate of rule changes related to firms that advise shareholders on corporate governance matters.\n Gensler has come under fire for the pace of rulemaking coming out of the agency, with critics claiming that dissecting the flood of new proposals in such short periods of time is impractical. Gensler has pointed out that the number of proposals largely on par with what former SEC chairs like Clayton have done. The latest proposals have just been more clustered than in the past, Gensler said.","dc:creator":"Declan Harty","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/d0/57/cb0ab99b4aab9fe248ba53e396f0/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1424028126"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, on Capitol Hill, Sept. 15, 2022, in Washington, D.C.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/d0/57/cb0ab99b4aab9fe248ba53e396f0/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1424028126"}}]},"content":"A dozen Senate Democrats asked Gary Gensler to give corporate America and the broader public more time to weigh in on the raft of rules the agency is proposing.","contentSnippet":"A dozen Senate Democrats asked Gary Gensler to give corporate America and the broader public more time to weigh in on the raft of rules the agency is proposing.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/20/senate-democrats-gensler-public-comments-sec-00062732","isoDate":"2022-10-20T17:21:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Christian Martinez","title":"Man suspected of being the Stockton serial killer is charged with three murders","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-18/stockton-serial-killer-suspect-charged-murders","pubDate":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 21:29:30 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Wesley Brownlee, 43, was charged Tuesday with murdering Jonathan Hernandez Rodriguez, Juan Cruz and Lawrence Lopez Sr., according to court records.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Wesley Brownlee, 43, was charged Tuesday with murdering Jonathan Hernandez Rodriguez, Juan Cruz and Lawrence Lopez Sr., according to court records.","dc:creator":"Christian Martinez","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/316b1e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1503+0+0/resize/1500x752!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2F59%2F06c3399b4b199c91c22c348fdab5%2Fbrownlee.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Wesley Brownlee, 43, was arrested for homicide in Stockton.

Laxalt helped lead unsuccessful legal challenges to the election results. \n The GOP’s calculation is that voters’ concerns about the cost of goods, crime and their dissatisfaction with Biden will outweigh independents’ disapproval of Trump, who lost the state by just 2.7 percentage points.","dc:creator":"Natalie Allison","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/be/c7/30938f24471fbd66a278e17e2d58/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1433282697"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Adam Laxalt has inched ahead of Catherine Cortez Masto by 2 percentage points, a gain from a month ago when he was down 3 percentage points.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/be/c7/30938f24471fbd66a278e17e2d58/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1433282697"}}]},"content":"Adam Laxalt has drawn even with Catherine Cortez Masto in a new poll shared exclusively with POLITICO.","contentSnippet":"Adam Laxalt has drawn even with Catherine Cortez Masto in a new poll shared exclusively with POLITICO.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/21/nevada-senate-race-dead-heat-00062850","isoDate":"2022-10-21T08:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    Matthew Perry Says Why He Was ‘Grateful’ To Jennifer Aniston Amid Addiction Battle\n\n","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-addiction-friends_n_6353f4d9e4b08e0e608f12d4","pubDate":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 12:54:01 -0400","content:encoded":"\n\n    The \"Friends\" star discussed a time his former co-star confronted him about his drinking.\n\n","content:encodedSnippet":"The \"Friends\" star discussed a time his former co-star confronted him about his drinking.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/635402a921000030003925bb.jpeg?cache=8klcj4lmtr&ops=224_126"},"comments":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-addiction-friends_n_6353f4d9e4b08e0e608f12d4#comments","content":"\n\n    The \"Friends\" star discussed a time his former co-star confronted him about his drinking.\n\n","contentSnippet":"The \"Friends\" star discussed a time his former co-star confronted him about his drinking.","guid":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-addiction-friends_n_6353f4d9e4b08e0e608f12d4","isoDate":"2022-10-22T16:54:01.000Z"},{"title":"The best wine, beer and spirits advent calendars of 2022","link":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/holidays-and-parties/packages/holidays/holiday-gift-guide/best-wine-and-alcohol-advent-calendars","guid":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/holidays-and-parties/packages/holidays/holiday-gift-guide/best-wine-and-alcohol-advent-calendars"},{"title":"\n\n    Biden Rips Lawmakers Who Pushed Billions In PPP Grants Now Bashing Student Debt Aid\n\n","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-ppp-loans-student-debt-forgiven_n_63530f09e4b051268c54cd94","pubDate":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 21:21:10 -0400","content:encoded":"\n\n    \"Who in the hell do they think they are?\" he asked an audience at Delaware State University.

Running hard to retain the seat he first won in 1980, he’s tweeted out video of his early-morning runs, done push-ups at public campaign events, and cut an ad touting his vitality. For a guy who would be 95 by the time his term ends, it seems like a smart move, short-circuiting concerns about whether he’s up to the job.\n But what if the concern over a longtime politician’s age has less to do with fear that the candidate might die or become incapacitated — and more to do with whether trying to snag yet another term at an age when almost everyone else is retired is just plain arrogant and greedy?\n \n Grassley makes a good test of that question — a test that merits attention from elected officials across this geriatric-run city, whether or not they have any particular tie to the Hawkeye State.\n Unlike Senate colleagues such as California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, Grassley has never been trailed by reports that he’s losing his marbles. Unlike a whole slew of other senators — including much younger pols like 50-year-old New Mexico Democrat Ben Ray Luján, who suffered a stroke — he hasn’t missed significant chunks of time due to serious health issues. His ad touts his best-in-the-Senate attendance record.\n And yet a poll published this week that has shocked political pros in the state suggests voters have serious qualms about Grassley’s age. The survey, by the veteran Iowa polling firm Selzer & Co., reported that Grassley was running only 3 points ahead of his Democratic challenger, Mike Franken. Iowa’s Republican governor, meanwhile, was leading her race by 17 points, according to the survey, conducted with the Des Moines Register.\n Despite months of Grassley-the-pushup-pro messaging, some 60 percent of respondents, including more than a third of Republicans, told pollsters that they thought age was a concern.\n The question that ought to occupy the minds of people like the incumbent president of the United States (who turns 80 this fall), his most likely 2024 challenger (now 76), the Democratic triumvirate atop the House of Representatives (82, 83 and 82) and maybe the entire Senate (the oldest in American history) is: What kind of concern? If nobody is challenging the notion that Grassley is physically and mentally up to the job, shouldn’t everything be fine?\n Apparently not, even for some fans. “Clearly there are people who are voting for him who are still concerned about his age,” says J. Ann Selzer, the veteran Iowa pollster behind the survey. That in itself is surprising, she says, given the nature of partisan voting today. “In this day and age you don’t see many instances where people give one answer and then contradict themselves.”\n Selzer says the same vibe was showing up in her surveys even before Grassley declared for reelection, as voters told her they would prefer if he didn’t run.\n The standard language of the questions she posed before Grassley decided to seek another is telling: They asked if voters would prefer to reelect Grassley or whether “it’s time for someone else to hold office.” It sounds less like a question about the incumbent’s physical health than a kindergarten teacher’s appeal to fairness. In September of 2021, nearly two-thirds of Selzer’s poll chose that option.\n In fact, it’s precisely because Grassley isn’t trailed by any health and acuity concerns that age is a compelling issue in the race. “It’s not because Mike Franken is bringing it up,” says Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist in Des Moines. “It’s because Grassley brings it up all the time.

Sad stories like the late years of Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran notwithstanding, we really don’t have anything resembling the dying, stupefied politburo of Brezhnev’s USSR. I’ll stipulate that Nancy Pelosi (82) and Mitch McConnell (80) could outthink and outwork most mortals, including me. The problem, instead, is an increasingly impenetrable elite with entrenched habits, jobs that get treated like entitlements and coteries of courtiers who disconnect them from the zeitgeist.\n If indeed some statistically relevant proportion of Iowa voters are saying that sometimes a guy’s just been around too long, that’s a good thing for Washington.

has recently conquered the internet</a>. TikTok now gets more visits than Google. Its average American viewer logs on for 80 minutes a day. And two-thirds of our teens use it. Once considered a delightful boon that entertained and diverted, the time-wasting app has recently followed the path of other new media sensations to become regarded as a bane. A cultural sensation of the 2020s, TikTok has also become the internet’s whipping boy, shamed by governments and advocates more often these days than even Facebook.</p> <p>Let’s stipulate from the get-go that TikTok deserves most of the bricks thrown at it. But in inventorying TikTok’s many downsides, let’s not forget to place the app in a historical context that might deflect some of the collective fury aimed at it. Setting aside for a moment the fact that Chinese proprietors control the personal data tossed off by the app, TikTok has much to commend it, and we shouldn’t be shy about saying so.</p> <p>New forms of media and communication have attracted suspicion and hostility <a href=\"https://fs.blog/an-old-argument-against-writing/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;ever since Plato denounced writing&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fs.blog/an-old-argument-against-writing/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5135000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5135000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">ever since Plato denounced writing</a> as something corrosive to memory.

It allowed anybody to enter your home. It turned the socially minded into shut-ins. It reduced parents’ gatekeeper power over their children. In 1894, a Philadelphia newspaper editor warned readers that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/When_Old_Technologies_Were_New/lDIQa7sf2aYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Electrical+World+reported+that+the+editor+of+a+prominent+Philadelphia%22&amp;pg=PA81&amp;printsec=frontcover\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;disease could be spread over a telephone line&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/When_Old_Technologies_Were_New/lDIQa7sf2aYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Electrical+World+reported+that+the+editor+of+a+prominent+Philadelphia%22&amp;pg=PA81&amp;printsec=frontcover&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51350012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51350013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">disease could be spread over a telephone line</a>. Similar scaremongering attended the arrival of radio and television, which allegedly polluted morals and vegetized viewers. More of the same has been directed at computer games, the internet and smartphones, and will be used against VR if ever widely adopted. In the 1890s, some critics even diagnosed societal dangers in electrification.</p> <p>The basest criticism of TikTok’s algorithm-powered river of short videos is that it’s a worthless time-sink, a sordid place for teenagers to swipe mindlessly though a never-ending deck of videos until their fingers blister. But is this uniquely bad? Wasting time on a silly diversion commands a solid pedigree. It’s called <i>leisure time</i>. Do not millions of grown-up house-spouses and retirees chain-watch soaps or cable news all afternoon without having to eat a griefburger over it? How many Americans tank up on football all weekend and then return on Monday and Thursday nights for refills?</p> <p>Yes, today’s average adolescent might be squandering an hour-and-a-half on TikTok daily, but haven’t earlier generations spent equal amounts of watching mindless television? Didn’t ’60s kids dial their transistor radio tuners from station to station in search of the perfect beat the way today’s TikTok users swipe though the app looking for stimulation? Weren’t there ’90s scares about “internet addiction”? Previous generations wasted hours each day talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends on the phone. Others played Dungeons and Dragons or Pokémon, read piles of comic books, played computer games endlessly or hung out at the games arcade.</p> <p>Every generation has found kicks in forms of media that required little effort on their part but frightened their parents. Conceding again that devoting an evening with TikTok isn’t as socially redeeming as volunteering at the soup kitchen or studying for an algebra final, we can’t allow the psychobabblists to tell us that TikTok is polluting the minds of a generation without filing a countercomplaint. There’s plenty of good to say about TikTok!</p> <p>TikTok’s highest value might be the way it gives the young a zone of separation from the adult internet (Twitter, Facebook). (Yes, adults use TikTok, too, but most of the fretting over the app is about what it does to kids.) Beaten down by helicopter parents, young people need media real estate they can call their own. For many users, TikTok provides a sense of community, a common base of reference. Like the long telephone calls of old, along with chatrooms and smartphone DMs, TikTok provides a media space in which adolescents can carry on without adult interruption. It’s a place to go to discover new music, follow fashion, explore hairstyles and track trends. In other words, a sourcebook on how to be a teen.</p> <p>Nobody would ever call TikTok’s news coverage comprehensive, but you can find timely and witty coverage there of current events at <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the <i>Washington Post&nbsp;</i>account&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51360000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51360001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">the <i>Washington Post&nbsp;</i>account</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcnews\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666036237534,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666036237534,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcnews&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-e77f-d425-a58b-e7ff820f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the BBC’s&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-e77f-d425-a58b-e7ff820f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">the BBC’s</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.interhacktives.com/2022/03/11/top-ten-tiktok-journalism/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;various commentary outposts&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.interhacktives.com/2022/03/11/top-ten-tiktok-journalism/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51360002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51360003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">various commentary outposts</a>.

In Britain, regulators want to fine the social media app for violating the privacy of minors. In California, the app faces a freshly bundled 80-pack of lawsuits charging it and other social media apps with hooking kids on the site. The Biden White House is pressuring the Chinese-owned app to improve data security, and some policy lords want at least part of it sold to an American or its American data stored domestically. When not denouncing TikTok for ruining the mental health of its young users, killing them, shortening our attention spans, serving oodles of political misinformation or contributing to political polarization, writers and lawsuits fault it for encouraging every self-destructive behavior from cutting to anorexia.\n These criticisms land particularly hard on TikTok because it has recently conquered the internet. TikTok now gets more visits than Google. Its average American viewer logs on for 80 minutes a day. And two-thirds of our teens use it. Once considered a delightful boon that entertained and diverted, the time-wasting app has recently followed the path of other new media sensations to become regarded as a bane. A cultural sensation of the 2020s, TikTok has also become the internet’s whipping boy, shamed by governments and advocates more often these days than even Facebook.\n Let’s stipulate from the get-go that TikTok deserves most of the bricks thrown at it. But in inventorying TikTok’s many downsides, let’s not forget to place the app in a historical context that might deflect some of the collective fury aimed at it. Setting aside for a moment the fact that Chinese proprietors control the personal data tossed off by the app, TikTok has much to commend it, and we shouldn’t be shy about saying so.\n New forms of media and communication have attracted suspicion and hostility ever since Plato denounced writing as something corrosive to memory. When the telegraph arrived in 1858, New York Times denounced it as\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/in-1858-people-said-the-telegraph-was-too-fast-for-the-truth/375171/\",\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5135000e\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5135000f\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">the New York Times denounced it as “superficial, sudden, unsifted, too fast for the truth,” and others declared it was a new way “to cheat, steal, lie, and deceive,” as historian Tom Standage put it. The telephone earned similar opprobrium for breaching class and family order. It allowed anybody to enter your home. It turned the socially minded into shut-ins. It reduced parents’ gatekeeper power over their children. In 1894, a Philadelphia newspaper editor warned readers that disease could be spread over a telephone line. Similar scaremongering attended the arrival of radio and television, which allegedly polluted morals and vegetized viewers. More of the same has been directed at computer games, the internet and smartphones, and will be used against VR if ever widely adopted. In the 1890s, some critics even diagnosed societal dangers in electrification.\n The basest criticism of TikTok’s algorithm-powered river of short videos is that it’s a worthless time-sink, a sordid place for teenagers to swipe mindlessly though a never-ending deck of videos until their fingers blister. But is this uniquely bad? Wasting time on a silly diversion commands a solid pedigree. It’s called leisure time. Do not millions of grown-up house-spouses and retirees chain-watch soaps or cable news all afternoon without having to eat a griefburger over it? How many Americans tank up on football all weekend and then return on Monday and Thursday nights for refills?\n Yes, today’s average adolescent might be squandering an hour-and-a-half on TikTok daily, but haven’t earlier generations spent equal amounts of watching mindless television? Didn’t ’60s kids dial their transistor radio tuners from station to station in search of the perfect beat the way today’s TikTok users swipe though the app looking for stimulation? Weren’t there ’90s scares about “internet addiction”? Previous generations wasted hours each day talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends on the phone. Others played Dungeons and Dragons or Pokémon, read piles of comic books, played computer games endlessly or hung out at the games arcade.\n Every generation has found kicks in forms of media that required little effort on their part but frightened their parents. Conceding again that devoting an evening with TikTok isn’t as socially redeeming as volunteering at the soup kitchen or studying for an algebra final, we can’t allow the psychobabblists to tell us that TikTok is polluting the minds of a generation without filing a countercomplaint. There’s plenty of good to say about TikTok!\n TikTok’s highest value might be the way it gives the young a zone of separation from the adult internet (Twitter, Facebook). (Yes, adults use TikTok, too, but most of the fretting over the app is about what it does to kids.) Beaten down by helicopter parents, young people need media real estate they can call their own. For many users, TikTok provides a sense of community, a common base of reference. Like the long telephone calls of old, along with chatrooms and smartphone DMs, TikTok provides a media space in which adolescents can carry on without adult interruption. It’s a place to go to discover new music, follow fashion, explore hairstyles and track trends. In other words, a sourcebook on how to be a teen.\n Nobody would ever call TikTok’s news coverage comprehensive, but you can find timely and witty coverage there of current events at Washington Post account\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost\",\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51360000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51360001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">the Washington Post account, the BBC’s, and various commentary outposts. Unlike Twitter or Facebook, TikTok allows users to express their personalities and creativity in videos, and some young creators are even earning megabucks for their efforts. Can their videos be banal and silly? Sure. But more banal than a round of golf or more pointless than gardening? Particularly for LGBTQ kids, minorities or subcultures, it serves as a place to meet others of your kind and not feel so alone. TikTok must be a lifeline for a gay kid who lives in the sticks. In this case, at least, we should be grateful for the power of the algorithm.\n Of course, TikTok can be anxiety-inducing, a tool of conformity and bullying, and a place to encourage teens to attempt dangerous “challenges.” But inducers of anxiety, conformity, bullying and risk-taking abound in society. In this regard, the perils of TikTok are more like normal life than they are an outlier.\n Sometimes the best way to judge a person or institution is to ask who opposes them. In the case of TikTok, always remember that President Donald Trump sought to ban it and the Russian government recently fined it for refusing to delete content that crossed laws against posting “LGBT propaganda.” With enemies like that, how bad can TikTok be?\n ******\n No, I don’t have a TikTok account.

Instead, they’re looking at a twin message through Election Day: hit Zeldin on his Trump loyalty and anti-abortion stance, but also pivot more toward her record on crime and the economy.\n They said they still expect her to continue the 20-year streak of outmaneuvering Republicans seeking statewide office, while conceding it might be a single-digit victory in a tough year for Democrats.\n “In September, there was more focus on the Democratic constellation” of abortion rights, gun safety and Trump, said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic strategist in New York who had advised several governors. “I would argue that in October, there has been more focus on crime, inflation and economic uncertainty.”\n What happens to Hochul matters beyond Albany. She’s at the top of the ticket, so Democrats are counting on her to drive voters to the polls to boost critical down-ballot campaigns in New York, which has as many close House races\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/11/new-york-house-races-election-2022-00055485\",\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50f10000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50f10001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">as many close House races as any state in the nation.\n “It’s not just about the governor’s race. We have three of the highest profile, must-win House races in the country here in New York,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “To lift them to victory, strength at the top of the ticket is absolutely essential.”Hochul continues to hammer on Zeldin's Trump ties in his native state where the former president lost by 23 percentage points in 2020. And she’s still talking about abortion access.\n \n \n Her campaign released two new ads Tuesday highlighting \"Zeldin’s MAGA agenda.\"\n \"The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher,\" Hochul says into the camera\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCoNLal8T_o\",\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50f10002\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50f10003\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">says into the camera in one new ad. \"Lee Zeldin says he wants abortion outlawed. He’d repeal New York’s common sense gun laws, and he even voted to overturn the 2020 election. That’s who he is, but it’s not who we are as New Yorkers.\"\n One new mailer from the State Democratic Committee shows six pictures of Trump and Zeldin together with the title: \"Best Friends Forever.\"\n Zeldin’s assertion that voters are more interested in pocketbook issues and crime than the former president appears to be in line\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/19/voters-economy-inflation-election-day-00062435\",\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50f10004\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50f10005\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">appears to be in line with what national polls show.\n \"New Yorkers want me focused on the issues that are related to them and their families,\" Zeldin said last week outside a pizza shop in Albany where the owner was concerned about local crime. \"They are thinking about their own breaking point in the state.\"\n Zeldin's challenge is twofold: rev up the Republican base without alienating Trump supporters, win with independents — who in New York outnumber GOP voters — and pull a portion of frustrated Democrats to his side.\n Hochul has stressed that abortion rights is still a critical issue for voters, and she has pressed that her administration has a \"laser focus\" on fighting crime — whether it's toughening bail reform laws passed in 2019, tightening access to guns or confiscating 8,000 illegal firearms over the past year.\n Speaking Wednesday to new State Police graduates in Albany, Hochul said shootings and homicides are down 14 percent in New York this year.\n \"We've had areas of great success,\" she told the room full of new officers and their families.\n \n \n Some Democratic consultants said Hochul, previously the lieutenant governor, needs to find a balance between hitting Zeldin and highlighting her own profile and record. She is still fairly new to many voters, having succeeded three-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo when he resigned in scandal in August 2021.\n There will be plenty of money to spend on messaging in the coming weeks. Hochul had $10.9 million remaining in the bank as of last week, while Zeldin had $4.5 million and has been boosted by several PACs spending.\n “Beyond the Democratic box-check stances, no one knows the real Kathy Hochul,” one downstate Democratic communications professional said on the condition of anonymity because they are involved in ongoing campaigns. “She’s got the lion share of dollars, but she lacks the lions’s roar. She’d benefit from, even in the homestretch, letting loose, axing the ‘safe’ stuff and being more herself and showcasing her agenda.”\n For Zeldin to win, he would have to get at least 30 percent of the vote in New York City, a Democratic stronghold, and win the suburbs and upstate New York handily — a recipe that has eluded Republicans since George Pataki won a third term as governor in 2002.\n The Quinnipiac poll, in particular, showed a glimmer of hope for Zeldin, with him down 59 percent to 37 percent in the city and with a slight lead in the city's suburbs. He had 52 percent support upstate, compared to Hochul’s 44 percent.\n Democrats criticized the poll, saying it undercounted the Democrats and women.\n \n \"I’m pretty confident that, while the race is tightening, it’s not as dire in terms of his closeness as two of the polls that came out, which I would say were poorly selected audiences,” Jacobs said.\n Hochul told reporters that her message focusing on Zeldin's record, fighting for abortion rights — as well as the economy and crime — is the right one, saying he voted against gun-control laws and federal measures to bolster the economy.\n \"I was on Long Island,” Hochul said Tuesday. “They're not happy with the fact that he voted against legislation that allowed me to fix potholes, infrastructure money. He voted against infrastructure. He voted against the CHIPS bill. You know what that did? That allowed us to drive Micron to the state of New York. So when voters find this out, they're shocked he's even running.\"","dc:creator":"Joseph Spector and Anna Gronewold","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/d4/8b/4ba979124ebebb286703a0ff947e/columbus-day-parade-80858.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Mary Altaffer/AP","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Until now, Gov.

The core of this exercise is a rigorous analysis of the admissible evidence under specific<i>&nbsp;</i>federal criminal statutes and the case law governing those statues.</p> <p>Second, in addition to the legal analysis, prosecutors also need to consider a host of discretionary factors, including some that might weigh against<i>&nbsp;</i>charging either Trump or Hunter Biden.

The story reported that “[f]ederal agents” investigating Biden “have gathered what they believe is sufficient evidence to charge him with tax crimes and a false statement related to a gun purchase” in October 2018, when he allegedly lied on <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;an ATF form&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">an ATF form</a> that asks whether the purchaser is a drug user.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/ab/5e/b84a6cd54de8ab29e23524909ce6/ap22225816067541.jpg\"> <br> <p>This was an odd story, for a couple of reasons. For one thing, as the article noted in passing, it is up to Justice Department prosecutors to make charging decisions, not FBI agents. The reason is not simply one of ego. Prosecutors are generally much better positioned — and are trained — to assess the relevant legal considerations, including, most obviously, what constitutes “admissible evidence” and whether the government can “probably” obtain a conviction at trial. When I was a federal prosecutor, I had the good fortune of working with some outstanding FBI agents, but virtually every prosecutor will, at some point, have had to explain to some case agents that there was not, in fact, enough evidence to charge a case despite what they thought; that they needed to obtain more evidence if prosecutors were going to seek an indictment; or, perhaps in the extreme, that they needed to close the investigation despite their best efforts to develop a prosecutable case.</p> <p>The other issue that was virtually absent from the <i>Post</i>’s story was any consideration of how the sorts of allegations apparently at issue in the Biden investigation are resolved in other federal criminal investigations. Tax evasion cases are notoriously tricky because <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/tax/file/629241/download\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;they usually require&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.justice.gov/tax/file/629241/download&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">they usually require</a> a heightened level of criminal intent — that the defendant actually knew that what he was doing was illegal, as opposed to simply engaging in unseemly but legal accounting shenanigans. This can be difficult if there were lawyers or accountants involved, which is one reason why even egregious tax evasion cases often reach seemingly baffling conclusions — like when, during the Trump administration, the Justice Department declined to prosecute <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/private-equity-ceo-enters-non-prosecution-agreement-international-tax-fraud-scheme-and-agrees\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a billionaire private equity CEO&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/private-equity-ceo-enters-non-prosecution-agreement-international-tax-fraud-scheme-and-agrees&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a billionaire private equity CEO</a> who resolved the investigation by agreeing to pay nearly $140 million in taxes and penalties.</p> <p>The same issue applies to the potential false statement charge against Biden that FBI agents reportedly identified. When I was just starting as a prosecutor and worked on low-level gun cases in the Eastern District of Virginia, we focused pretty much exclusively on just one type of case — when the defendant was a so-called straw purchaser who had lied on <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the ATF’s form&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">the ATF’s form</a> about the fact that he was buying the gun on behalf of a convicted felon who would otherwise have been unable to lawfully purchase it himself.</p> <p>Biden <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hunter-biden-book/2021/03/31/362b9748-9271-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;has acknowledged&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hunter-biden-book/2021/03/31/362b9748-9271-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">has acknowledged</a> that he was using drugs at the time of the purchase, but even so, it is far from clear from the reported facts that Biden would be prosecuted for this if he were not Joe Biden’s son. Among other things, he affirmatively admitted his drug use, has evidently been cooperating with the department’s investigation and also has no criminal history. Another reason is that many members of the public — and I suspect this applies to a lot of the people clamoring for Biden’s prosecution — would probably not want the Justice Department aggressively investigating and prosecuting every gun purchaser who might be using illegal drugs in private. This does not necessarily mean that there would — or should — be no consequences, but for a first-time offender on these facts, there would be credible arguments in favor of a declination (no charges filed), <a href=\"https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/9-608-6205?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a non-prosecution agreement&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/9-608-6205?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a non-prosecution agreement</a>, <a href=\"https://content.next.westlaw.com/practical-law/document/I8b0f218c102b11e598db8b09b4f043e0/deferred-prosecution?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=adcabcca3cf245dcb6ee66a61609bf33&amp;contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a deferred prosecution agreement&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://content.next.westlaw.com/practical-law/document/I8b0f218c102b11e598db8b09b4f043e0/deferred-prosecution?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=adcabcca3cf245dcb6ee66a61609bf33&amp;contextData=(sc.RelatedInfo)&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0016&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf512d0017&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a deferred prosecution agreement</a> or a plea agreement with no recommended term of incarceration from prosecutors.</p> <p>As for Trump, it is also not the case that the Justice Department will prosecute Trump simply because they have compiled evidence sufficient to convict him at trial based, for instance, on his apparent mishandling of sensitive government documents.

Every day seems to bring some fresh new possibility or development in a high-profile criminal investigation, along with the opportunity to speculate about whether a major public figure will wind up in prison. Most of the time these days, we’re talking about Donald Trump, but of course the current president’s son, Hunter Biden, is also under federal criminal investigation, and that has generated similar questions about how that investigation will be resolved.\n Much of this commentary, however, has relied on a mechanistic account of how federal prosecutors operate in complex cases: an assumption that if there is sufficient evidence of a crime, then it will, or at least should be, prosecuted. That’s incomplete at best and misleading at worst. The result has been a widespread over-simplification of the questions that Attorney General Merrick Garland and the prosecutors working on these investigations will need to confront — and the distinct possibility that, one way or another, many people will be confused or disappointed if their preferred target is not ultimately indicted.\n It is worth taking a step back and understanding the decision-making framework that is supposed to govern whether the Justice Department seeks an indictment of someone. The department has a set of policies that govern such “charging decisions,” but they provide prosecutors with discretion in determining whether to criminally charge someone, and in the Trump and Biden cases, that discretionary element could be crucial.\n \n  \n Generally speaking, there are two prongs to this internal charging analysis under Justice Department policy — one that is legal and one that is prudential — and both must be satisfied.\n First, prosecutors need to determine that they would actually be able to convict the potential defendant at a trial. Justice Department policy explains that prosecutors “should commence or recommend federal prosecution” if they believe that they can “probably” get a conviction at trial based on the “admissible evidence.” Put differently, they must believe that they can actually convince a jury to unanimously conclude that the defendant committed each element of the relevant criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, notwithstanding the possible defenses at trial, which prosecutors also take into account when making their decision. The core of this exercise is a rigorous analysis of the admissible evidence under specific federal criminal statutes and the case law governing those statues.\n Second, in addition to the legal analysis, prosecutors also need to consider a host of discretionary factors, including some that might weigh against charging either Trump or Hunter Biden. In particular, prosecutors must consider whether “(1) the prosecution would serve no substantial federal interest; (2) the person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.” The Justice Department identifies nine different subsidiary considerations that might weigh for or against a finding that a prosecution would serve a “substantial federal interest.” The list — which is not exhaustive — includes the seriousness of the offense, the deterrent effect of a prosecution, the person’s “culpability in connection with the offense,” his criminal history, his “personal circumstances,” and the “probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted.”\n \n Ordinarily, federal prosecutors do not need to give these much thought. In the standard case — which tends to involve illegal immigration, guns or drugs — these considerations are either inconsequential or trivial, both because the public expects certain types of cases to be federally prosecuted and because prosecutors have a significant body of experience and past practice to guide their charging decisions.\n Things are not so simple, however, when the underlying conduct is either relatively unusual or concerns a subject in which prosecutors tend to be more flexible in their approach to criminal charges.\n A recent report from the Washington Post about the Hunter Biden investigation illustrated this problem well, if somewhat obliquely. The story reported that “[f]ederal agents” investigating Biden “have gathered what they believe is sufficient evidence to charge him with tax crimes and a false statement related to a gun purchase” in October 2018, when he allegedly lied on an ATF form that asks whether the purchaser is a drug user.\n \n  \n This was an odd story, for a couple of reasons. For one thing, as the article noted in passing, it is up to Justice Department prosecutors to make charging decisions, not FBI agents. The reason is not simply one of ego. Prosecutors are generally much better positioned — and are trained — to assess the relevant legal considerations, including, most obviously, what constitutes “admissible evidence” and whether the government can “probably” obtain a conviction at trial. When I was a federal prosecutor, I had the good fortune of working with some outstanding FBI agents, but virtually every prosecutor will, at some point, have had to explain to some case agents that there was not, in fact, enough evidence to charge a case despite what they thought; that they needed to obtain more evidence if prosecutors were going to seek an indictment; or, perhaps in the extreme, that they needed to close the investigation despite their best efforts to develop a prosecutable case.\n The other issue that was virtually absent from the Post’s story was any consideration of how the sorts of allegations apparently at issue in the Biden investigation are resolved in other federal criminal investigations. Tax evasion cases are notoriously tricky because they usually require a heightened level of criminal intent — that the defendant actually knew that what he was doing was illegal, as opposed to simply engaging in unseemly but legal accounting shenanigans. This can be difficult if there were lawyers or accountants involved, which is one reason why even egregious tax evasion cases often reach seemingly baffling conclusions — like when, during the Trump administration, the Justice Department declined to prosecute a billionaire private equity CEO who resolved the investigation by agreeing to pay nearly $140 million in taxes and penalties.\n The same issue applies to the potential false statement charge against Biden that FBI agents reportedly identified. When I was just starting as a prosecutor and worked on low-level gun cases in the Eastern District of Virginia, we focused pretty much exclusively on just one type of case — when the defendant was a so-called straw purchaser who had lied on the ATF’s form about the fact that he was buying the gun on behalf of a convicted felon who would otherwise have been unable to lawfully purchase it himself.\n Biden has acknowledged that he was using drugs at the time of the purchase, but even so, it is far from clear from the reported facts that Biden would be prosecuted for this if he were not Joe Biden’s son. Among other things, he affirmatively admitted his drug use, has evidently been cooperating with the department’s investigation and also has no criminal history. Another reason is that many members of the public — and I suspect this applies to a lot of the people clamoring for Biden’s prosecution — would probably not want the Justice Department aggressively investigating and prosecuting every gun purchaser who might be using illegal drugs in private. This does not necessarily mean that there would — or should — be no consequences, but for a first-time offender on these facts, there would be credible arguments in favor of a declination (no charges filed), a non-prosecution agreement, a deferred prosecution agreement or a plea agreement with no recommended term of incarceration from prosecutors.\n As for Trump, it is also not the case that the Justice Department will prosecute Trump simply because they have compiled evidence sufficient to convict him at trial based, for instance, on his apparent mishandling of sensitive government documents. The actual contents of the documents that Trump retained could weigh very heavily in this analysis even though we — the public — currently know virtually nothing about what is actually in them beyond the classification designations. They include documents marked at the highest level of classification — a very bad fact for Trump — but if, hypothetically, the Justice Department were to conclude that Trump took a bunch of scattered bits of classified information that are practically useless to third parties in isolation, that might weigh against charging him.\n \n \n Another consideration that specialists in this area of prosecution have identified is whether the DOJ could reveal the contents of the documents in a court case without significantly harming national security. Still another set of relevant discretionary factors would be those that former FBI Director James Comey identified when he declined to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton. At the time, Comey explained that earlier prosecutions concerning the “mishandling or removal of classified information” involved “some combination of” several factors. They do not necessarily favor Trump — among other things, Comey identified “efforts to obstruct justice” as an aggravating factor — but the Justice Department is likely to look very closely at comparable cases to ensure that any resolution of the Trump investigation is consistent with the government’s approach to other cases, including the Clinton investigation and others that have not been extensively aired in public.\n Many people have presented the situation confronting the Justice Department more simply — as a question of whether the Justice Department has sufficient evidence to indict Trump to convict him during a trial — in part based on public comments by Garland, but they are less straightforward than people are inclined to think. Last week provided a fairly representative example in the form of a lengthy story from The Atlantic that argued that Garland is likely to indict Trump based, among other things, on Garland’s “belief in the rule of law.”\n \n  \n I could go on about what “the rule of law” actually means as a legal or technical matter — and I have — but let’s focus on Garland’s approach, which he has described nearly verbatim in a series of speeches and remarks since taking office. “The essence of the rule of law is that like cases are treated alike,” Garland said when he accepted Joe Biden’s nomination. “That there not be one rule for Democrats, and another for Republicans, one rule for friends, another for foes, one rule for the powerful, another for the powerless.”\n One interpretation of these comments is that no one is above the law, and that if you commit a crime, you should be prosecuted.

The 44-year-old from Moscow had a good job in telecommunications and was able to take frequent vacations in Europe. He was more focused on his family and career than keeping up with the news and machinations in the Kremlin. But in 2015, everything changed when Boris Nemtsov, a popular opposition leader, was assassinated.</p> <p>“There was no doubt in my mind that Putin or his inner circle ordered the killing,” Roman says. “I had rational issues with Putin and the government after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, but this murder made everything emotional. I became fully politically involved — I followed the news, went to protests and blogged.”</p> <p>Roman became disillusioned with Putin and his regime, and now finds himself at odds with the majority of Russians who support his war in Ukraine. On Sept. 21, when Putin declared a “partial” military mobilization that would draft at least 300,000 additional soldiers, men like Roman faced a life-or-death choice: If they received draft notices but refused to go, they would risk a 10-year prison sentence for draft evasion; if they couldn’t avoid the draft, they would risk death in a war they didn’t believe in. The only other alternative was to try to flee the country.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314069890112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p><br>POLITICO spoke with seven Russian men, including Roman, who oppose the war and have had to choose among those three options.

I knew this was the end of Russia. I worried for my three kids, for their future. I thought about emigration a lot, but I kept putting it off — kids had school, I had a job. These were all excuses.</p> <p>On Sept. 21 when Putin announced “partial” mobilization, I went to a protest for the first time in a couple of years. With this new possibility of a draft — I’m a reserve officer so I was a prime candidate for it — I considered my options: die in Putin’s war refusing to fight or die in prison. I don't want to kill anyone for no reason, especially not for Putin.</p> <p>No one I know asked, “How can we rebel?” Everyone is demoralized. And I don’t think you can resist — there is no way to successfully protest in Russia. I told everyone they should leave but I was paralyzed by shock.</p> <p>On Sept. 27, I received a call from a friend. There were rumors that Russia might close the borders the next day, so my friend asked me straightforwardly: “Would you leave? Yes or no. You have 10 minutes to decide, here is a plane ticket to Armenia if you say yes.”</p> <p>“Yes,” I said. Making this decision was like ripping off a bandage. Right away, I went home and hugged my kids goodbye. It was really hard — I never had to tell them goodbye in this way before. I packed my running clothing and a laptop. The airport was packed that day, mostly with men of draft age, many carrying only backpacks. I was traveling with a group of successful professional grown men who cried like little girls because they are forced to leave their families. We passed border control without any issues. </p> <p>The next day, in Yerevan, I finally felt free. For the first time in a long time, I could think past tomorrow. I started to imagine a future for my family anywhere else but Russia. I told my wife to sell everything she can, take the kids and join me. I don’t care if this life might mean financial struggles — I would take any job, I just want my kids to grow up free.</p> <p><br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/8f/64/d112f43649b5b24d195cc4f28247/2-russiadepart-mikhail.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Mikhail</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">(Pseudonym)</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 39</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Yakutsk,</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">the Sakha Republic, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">W</span>hen the mobilization started, I planned to flee. I bought a plane ticket, but I wasn’t courageous enough to choose a life of poverty and uncertainty as a refugee, so I stayed. If the military recruiters came for me, I would rather go to prison or willingly die on the battlefield than take another person’s life.</p> <p>Like many, I was in shock when the war in Ukraine started on Feb. 24. To me and many other Yakuts, who are a Turkic ethnic group and identify as Asian, it was inconceivable that one Slavic group, Russians, could attack another Slavic group — Ukrainians. </p> <p>My opinion about this war and mobilization is shaped a lot by my region and its culture. The Sakha Republic is quite unique; it’s a remote region along the Arctic Ocean in the Russian Far East. Yakuts are the majority, and we have a separate history, language and culture. We have been often treated like a colony — during the Soviet times, our region was commonly perceived as land used for its resources rather than a place to live. Our ethnic identity was suppressed too in the Soviet attempt to make everyone “Russian.” When my parents were young, they were forbidden to speak the Yakut language in public spaces.</p> <p>I became interested in politics around 2012 when Vladimir Putin was reelected for a third term despite widespread allegations of fraud. In the following years, I watched how the political situation in the country has been getting worse.</p> <p>At first, when Putin’s partial mobilization announcement on Wednesday, Sept. 21 came out, I didn’t think it would affect me. I have high blood pressure, which excused me from the mandatory military service after college, so, considering that Putin said they wanted only men with military experience, I assumed that it was safe. In the following two days, many men in Yakutsk without any military experience received draft notes. They went to the recruitment office to clarify what they thought was a misunderstanding — they were taken to the war.</p> <p>Many men I knew had fled the country. Some of my colleagues fled with just a backpack and let their management know after the fact. I decided to leave the country as well. Air travel is practically the only way out of Yakutsk, so the following Saturday I bought a plane ticket to Novosibirsk for next Wednesday.</p> <p>I agonized over my decision all weekend and on Monday, I canceled the flight. I don’t have much money and I realized that if I fled, I would choose a life of struggle and poverty. I admire the people who left but I couldn’t muster the courage myself. I decided to stay and help those who fled by mailing them things they left behind — documents, warm clothing, etc. Someone has to do this.</p> <p>If I get drafted, my plan is to tell the recruiters that I’m unreliable. I believe Russia is an aggressor and I support Ukraine, I won’t fight — this makes me a terrible recruit. I might be sent to prison for this — it’s illegal in Russia to speak badly of the army, and a new law makes avoiding the draft a prison-punishing offense. I would rather go to prison than go to the war.</p> <p>If they still send me to the war, I will be like James McAvoy’s character in<i> Atonement: </i>I’ll wander meaninglessly on the battlefield until someone or something kills me. I can’t shoot anyone. I never took to hunting, a nearly religious practice for Yakuts. I know some Yakuts who say that want to go to the war “to take a break from work and family,” they don’t see Ukrainians as people and don’t mind killing them. Personally, I would rather die than kill anyone.</p> <p>Recently, a lot of women came together to protest mobilization in Yakutsk. It was purposefully organized and attended by women because this is the only way to keep it peaceful — the police tend to beat up and arrest men. Still, in the end, some women were arrested, even older women. It’s an unacceptable way to treat women in our culture and was hard to watch. You can overthrow the government only in a democracy. Russia, unfortunately, is an authoritarian regime and all the institutions like police and courts serve just one person – Vladimir Putin. You can’t storm the Kremlin – there are too many police on their side. I feel like I live in <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>.</p> <p> </p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e2/0e/d38c045a4c23a8ff3097c7cd444e/3-russiadepart-sergei.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Sergei</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 44</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Saint Petersburg, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span> left Russia because I lost all hope.</p> <p>They say, if you can’t tolerate the messy present, study the Middle Ages. That’s what I did — I restored old books and focused on the past. For the longest time, my family avoided politics. I hadn't followed the news, but when I heard that Russia annexed Crimea [in 2014], I thought it was a good thing — I had an imperialist mindset and liked the idea that Russia was strong, and it was getting some of the old territories back. I wish I’d woken up to the reality sooner.</p> <p>The mandatory vaccination against Covid-19 was the push I needed that shook me awake and got me interested in politics. At some point in the pandemic, I refused to get vaccinated per the requirement for state employees — I worked at a state museum then. Management banned me from showing up to work and stopped paying me, so I quit.

Being tracked like that, not being able to enter a grocery store without a QR code, made me feel like a misfit.</p> <p>After the war started in February, things started to get worse. My wife and I sent our elder son to Tbilisi, Georgia, and planned to join him later. But I got a dream job — restoration of old books at the National Library of Russia. As the months flew by, Russia was turning into a fascist state. There is a pro-war letter “Z” everywhere and there are many fascists who say, “We should kill Ukrainians.” Propaganda works well, especially on the older generation. I haven’t talked to my mother in months because of it.</p> <p>In August, my wife, our two other kids and I went to Tbilisi again. They stayed there, but I decided to return to Russia. A week later, mobilization started, and I realized I had to leave for good — I’m a reserve officer, young and in good health. Going to the war and fighting against Ukrainians was not an option. I didn’t want to go to prison either.</p> <p>I had heard that there was a long line at the checkpoint I usually travel through to get to Georgia, so I traveled to Vishnevka, a checkpoint in the Volgograd Oblast bordering Kazakhstan. I’ve heard the line there was shorter. I got there on Sept. 25, and it was long. I wasn’t prepared. I didn’t bring winter clothing with me and the night in the line was freezing. The next day I realized that the line wasn’t moving at all and I overheard the border control had unofficial orders to slow people down. By then, we’d heard the rumors that the borders might close officially on the 28<sup>th</sup>, and if I’d stayed in that line, I would not have made it out.</p> <p>My wife bought me a plane ticket to Belarus instead, and I turned around and headed to a nearby airport. I stayed two days in Minsk until I managed to buy a ticket to Georgia and reunited with my family on Sept. 30th.</p> <p>It’s great to be finally free — I probably will have to work as a plumber or electrician, but I’m grateful to be out of Russia. Some of the Georgians do call us racist slurs and they might kick Russian emigrants out. We deserve it, but I hope it won’t come to that.</p> <p>On Oct. 5, days after I left Russia, a former colleague of mine reached out to say a draft notice in my name arrived at the State Hermitage Museum where I used to work until February. I didn’t think the recruiters would come that close to finding me. There is nothing to go back for.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/af/d6/2fa597c14295ad473645d6e10b97/4-russiadepart-umaraskhab.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Umaraskhab M.</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 43</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">R</span>ussian problems go much deeper than Vladimir Putin. I think he represents the desire of so many white Russians to uplift Russia. However, the way they often envision it means continuous suppression of my people and other ethnic groups. </p> <p>I’m a Muslim and I was born and raised in Makhachkala, the capital of the Republic of Dagestan. This beautiful region in the North Caucasus has its own culture and a long history of resistance to Russia over the centuries. </p> <p>I left Dagestan in 2000 for the army after dropping out of college. My younger brother was drafted for mandatory military service and I decided to sign up as well, so he wouldn’t go alone. The Russian military is notorious for its hazing; racist attitudes toward Dagestanis and other “Black” people only make this terrible tradition even harder for them.</p> <p>Before the army, I never was called any of the racial slurs that are so common outside of the Caucasus. The city is very diverse; there are more than 36 different ethnic groups, and because of it, racial tension is uncommon. I’m Avar, which is technically Caucasian, but in Russia people like me from the Caucasus are often considered Black.</p> <p>It was particularly bad in the military base where I served because people there weren’t used to dealing with Dagestani men. As they hazed new recruits, Russians bent to their will, their norms. Dagestani men didn’t, so there were a lot of fights. I fought, too, and for one fight with an officer I was sent to the penal battalion for half a year. Soon after I got out, another Russian picked a fight with me and I ended up going to prison for three years for it. Many Dagestani serving in the military end up in prison this way.</p> <p>In 2000, I committed a “sin” — I voted for Putin during his first run for president. But just a few years later, in prison, I had a political awakening. I read newspapers, became interested in politics and realized how corrupt Putin and his close circle were. From the news stories, I saw that Putin was eliminating any political opposition, not a sign of a good leader. </p> <p>Soon after my release, I moved to St. Petersburg and for a couple of years was involved in local politics and went to protests — against Putin, the local government and anything else I found important. Over time less and less independent media became available. I lost belief in the Russian opposition. I realized what this government was long before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russians split into two groups who believed that Crimea was either Ukrainian or Russian. I think they are both wrong: Crimea belongs to the Crimean Tatars, its indigenous group. They should be the ones deciding Crimea’s fate. </p> <p>When it comes to mobilization, I should be exempt because I have four kids. But Russia has lost thousands of soldiers in this war and it desperately needs to plug this hole and recruit as much cannon fodder as possible. And I don’t trust the recruitment office; they trick people, they give you documents to sign and suddenly you are a contractor on the way to Ukraine. This is what’s happening back in Dagestan — they round up Dagestanis who are not supposed to be mobilized and try to get them to sign contracts. I think it’s disproportionally targeting Dagestan men and it’s just a new way to suppress the Caucasus region. Dagestan, however, fights back against the mobilization — there have been heated protests. Many Dagestani men have fled, and who can blame them? Islam doesn’t permit unlawful murders or participations in unjust wars. Of course, there are Dagestanis who align themselves with the government and support Putin, especially in the villages. They sold out.</p> <p>Maybe white Russians could do something about Putin. Maybe they could protest. I’m Black, I can’t go out and protest on their behalf. If I protest and get arrested, I can get charged with extremism. I hear people who have fled Russia speak eloquently about Putin and how all of this is his fault. But even if Russians overthrow Putin and install someone new like Alexei Navalny, it would be just a new führer — Russians are too focused on preserving what they perceive as Russianness, and that is whiteness.</p> <p><br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/61/08/36df0bfd45b8ad291458ba7ab0b8/5-russiadepart-konstantin.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Konstantin Konkov</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 22</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Moscow</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">O</span>n Sept. 27, a recruiter and police officers stopped me outside of the government building where I work and tried to illegally give me a draft notice. I managed to stand my ground and be left alone.</p> <p>There are numerous reports of unlawful mobilization: Recruiters are not filling out draft notices correctly, recruiters are delivering notices to people who are supposed to be excluded from mobilization and people are being drafted even if they are not in the reserves. I’m a student, and my supporters and I tried to explain it to a recruiter outside of the Council of Deputies building where I work as a Mozhaysky District representative. The fact that I’m still a student is supposed to make me exempt from the mobilization despite my past military service, but it was tricky at the time — I’m not studying at the same university where I started after high school, which could have potentially negated my right to be excused because of my studies.</p> <p>Luckily, I and people who came out to support me didn’t get confused when a recruiter approached me; we demanded to see the documents that enabled him to give me a draft notice. It turned out he didn’t have a right to do so. Once he and his allies understood, they left.

The 44-year-old from Moscow had a good job in telecommunications and was able to take frequent vacations in Europe. He was more focused on his family and career than keeping up with the news and machinations in the Kremlin. But in 2015, everything changed when Boris Nemtsov, a popular opposition leader, was assassinated.\n “There was no doubt in my mind that Putin or his inner circle ordered the killing,” Roman says. “I had rational issues with Putin and the government after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, but this murder made everything emotional. I became fully politically involved — I followed the news, went to protests and blogged.”\n Roman became disillusioned with Putin and his regime, and now finds himself at odds with the majority of Russians who support his war in Ukraine. On Sept. 21, when Putin declared a “partial” military mobilization that would draft at least 300,000 additional soldiers, men like Roman faced a life-or-death choice: If they received draft notices but refused to go, they would risk a 10-year prison sentence for draft evasion; if they couldn’t avoid the draft, they would risk death in a war they didn’t believe in. The only other alternative was to try to flee the country.\n \n \n \nPOLITICO spoke with seven Russian men, including Roman, who oppose the war and have had to choose among those three options. Some of them, like Roman, have left the country — and their families — behind. Others are hunkering down, avoiding strangers and planning escape routes from their workplaces, hoping a draft notice won’t land in their hands. They’ve heard the widespread reports of forced conscriptions, including of men who are older than the age limit for mobilization (up to 50 for soldiers and 65 for high-ranking officers) and those who have health issues or no military experience. There are also reports of minority ethnic groups such as Crimean Tatars, Dagestanis and Siberian indigenous groups being disproportionately conscripted.\n \n The perspectives of these seven men offer a glimpse into the toll Putin’s war is having on ordinary Russians, particularly those who disagree with the Kremlin’s line.\n “These people are not fleeing the war, they are not afraid of death,” Roman says. “They are fleeing this [hopeless] situation.”\n These interviews were conducted in Russian through texts and calls on Telegram and Messenger. Most of the men chose to keep some form of anonymity, fearing that they could face backlash from the government and be imprisoned for their words.\n The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n   \n   \n Roman P.\n Age: 44\n From: Moscow\n The start of the war in Ukraine on Feb. 24 was devastating. I knew this was the end of Russia. I worried for my three kids, for their future. I thought about emigration a lot, but I kept putting it off — kids had school, I had a job. These were all excuses.\n On Sept. 21 when Putin announced “partial” mobilization, I went to a protest for the first time in a couple of years. With this new possibility of a draft — I’m a reserve officer so I was a prime candidate for it — I considered my options: die in Putin’s war refusing to fight or die in prison. I don't want to kill anyone for no reason, especially not for Putin.\n No one I know asked, “How can we rebel?” Everyone is demoralized. And I don’t think you can resist — there is no way to successfully protest in Russia. I told everyone they should leave but I was paralyzed by shock.\n On Sept. 27, I received a call from a friend. There were rumors that Russia might close the borders the next day, so my friend asked me straightforwardly: “Would you leave? Yes or no. You have 10 minutes to decide, here is a plane ticket to Armenia if you say yes.”\n “Yes,” I said. Making this decision was like ripping off a bandage. Right away, I went home and hugged my kids goodbye. It was really hard — I never had to tell them goodbye in this way before. I packed my running clothing and a laptop. The airport was packed that day, mostly with men of draft age, many carrying only backpacks. I was traveling with a group of successful professional grown men who cried like little girls because they are forced to leave their families. We passed border control without any issues. \n The next day, in Yerevan, I finally felt free. For the first time in a long time, I could think past tomorrow. I started to imagine a future for my family anywhere else but Russia. I told my wife to sell everything she can, take the kids and join me. I don’t care if this life might mean financial struggles — I would take any job, I just want my kids to grow up free.\n \n \n  \n   \n Mikhail\n (Pseudonym)\n Age: 39\n From: Yakutsk,\n the Sakha Republic, Russia\n When the mobilization started, I planned to flee. I bought a plane ticket, but I wasn’t courageous enough to choose a life of poverty and uncertainty as a refugee, so I stayed. If the military recruiters came for me, I would rather go to prison or willingly die on the battlefield than take another person’s life.\n Like many, I was in shock when the war in Ukraine started on Feb. 24. To me and many other Yakuts, who are a Turkic ethnic group and identify as Asian, it was inconceivable that one Slavic group, Russians, could attack another Slavic group — Ukrainians. \n My opinion about this war and mobilization is shaped a lot by my region and its culture. The Sakha Republic is quite unique; it’s a remote region along the Arctic Ocean in the Russian Far East. Yakuts are the majority, and we have a separate history, language and culture. We have been often treated like a colony — during the Soviet times, our region was commonly perceived as land used for its resources rather than a place to live. Our ethnic identity was suppressed too in the Soviet attempt to make everyone “Russian.” When my parents were young, they were forbidden to speak the Yakut language in public spaces.\n I became interested in politics around 2012 when Vladimir Putin was reelected for a third term despite widespread allegations of fraud. In the following years, I watched how the political situation in the country has been getting worse.\n At first, when Putin’s partial mobilization announcement on Wednesday, Sept. 21 came out, I didn’t think it would affect me. I have high blood pressure, which excused me from the mandatory military service after college, so, considering that Putin said they wanted only men with military experience, I assumed that it was safe. In the following two days, many men in Yakutsk without any military experience received draft notes. They went to the recruitment office to clarify what they thought was a misunderstanding — they were taken to the war.\n Many men I knew had fled the country. Some of my colleagues fled with just a backpack and let their management know after the fact. I decided to leave the country as well. Air travel is practically the only way out of Yakutsk, so the following Saturday I bought a plane ticket to Novosibirsk for next Wednesday.\n I agonized over my decision all weekend and on Monday, I canceled the flight. I don’t have much money and I realized that if I fled, I would choose a life of struggle and poverty. I admire the people who left but I couldn’t muster the courage myself. I decided to stay and help those who fled by mailing them things they left behind — documents, warm clothing, etc. Someone has to do this.\n If I get drafted, my plan is to tell the recruiters that I’m unreliable. I believe Russia is an aggressor and I support Ukraine, I won’t fight — this makes me a terrible recruit. I might be sent to prison for this — it’s illegal in Russia to speak badly of the army, and a new law makes avoiding the draft a prison-punishing offense. I would rather go to prison than go to the war.\n If they still send me to the war, I will be like James McAvoy’s character in Atonement: I’ll wander meaninglessly on the battlefield until someone or something kills me. I can’t shoot anyone. I never took to hunting, a nearly religious practice for Yakuts. I know some Yakuts who say that want to go to the war “to take a break from work and family,” they don’t see Ukrainians as people and don’t mind killing them. Personally, I would rather die than kill anyone.\n Recently, a lot of women came together to protest mobilization in Yakutsk. It was purposefully organized and attended by women because this is the only way to keep it peaceful — the police tend to beat up and arrest men. Still, in the end, some women were arrested, even older women. It’s an unacceptable way to treat women in our culture and was hard to watch. You can overthrow the government only in a democracy. Russia, unfortunately, is an authoritarian regime and all the institutions like police and courts serve just one person – Vladimir Putin. You can’t storm the Kremlin – there are too many police on their side. I feel like I live in The Handmaid’s Tale.\n  \n   \n   \n Sergei\n Age: 44\n From: Saint Petersburg, Russia\n I left Russia because I lost all hope.\n They say, if you can’t tolerate the messy present, study the Middle Ages. That’s what I did — I restored old books and focused on the past. For the longest time, my family avoided politics. I hadn't followed the news, but when I heard that Russia annexed Crimea [in 2014], I thought it was a good thing — I had an imperialist mindset and liked the idea that Russia was strong, and it was getting some of the old territories back. I wish I’d woken up to the reality sooner.\n The mandatory vaccination against Covid-19 was the push I needed that shook me awake and got me interested in politics. At some point in the pandemic, I refused to get vaccinated per the requirement for state employees — I worked at a state museum then. Management banned me from showing up to work and stopped paying me, so I quit. Around the same time, St. Petersburg was requiring people to scan QR codes before entering public spaces to prove that they were vaccinated against Covid-19 or tested negative. Being tracked like that, not being able to enter a grocery store without a QR code, made me feel like a misfit.\n After the war started in February, things started to get worse. My wife and I sent our elder son to Tbilisi, Georgia, and planned to join him later. But I got a dream job — restoration of old books at the National Library of Russia. As the months flew by, Russia was turning into a fascist state. There is a pro-war letter “Z” everywhere and there are many fascists who say, “We should kill Ukrainians.” Propaganda works well, especially on the older generation. I haven’t talked to my mother in months because of it.\n In August, my wife, our two other kids and I went to Tbilisi again. They stayed there, but I decided to return to Russia. A week later, mobilization started, and I realized I had to leave for good — I’m a reserve officer, young and in good health. Going to the war and fighting against Ukrainians was not an option. I didn’t want to go to prison either.\n I had heard that there was a long line at the checkpoint I usually travel through to get to Georgia, so I traveled to Vishnevka, a checkpoint in the Volgograd Oblast bordering Kazakhstan. I’ve heard the line there was shorter. I got there on Sept. 25, and it was long. I wasn’t prepared. I didn’t bring winter clothing with me and the night in the line was freezing. The next day I realized that the line wasn’t moving at all and I overheard the border control had unofficial orders to slow people down. By then, we’d heard the rumors that the borders might close officially on the 28th, and if I’d stayed in that line, I would not have made it out.\n My wife bought me a plane ticket to Belarus instead, and I turned around and headed to a nearby airport. I stayed two days in Minsk until I managed to buy a ticket to Georgia and reunited with my family on Sept. 30th.\n It’s great to be finally free — I probably will have to work as a plumber or electrician, but I’m grateful to be out of Russia. Some of the Georgians do call us racist slurs and they might kick Russian emigrants out. We deserve it, but I hope it won’t come to that.\n On Oct. 5, days after I left Russia, a former colleague of mine reached out to say a draft notice in my name arrived at the State Hermitage Museum where I used to work until February. I didn’t think the recruiters would come that close to finding me. There is nothing to go back for.\n \n  \n   \n Umaraskhab M.\n Age: 43\n From: Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan, Russia\n Russian problems go much deeper than Vladimir Putin. I think he represents the desire of so many white Russians to uplift Russia. However, the way they often envision it means continuous suppression of my people and other ethnic groups. \n I’m a Muslim and I was born and raised in Makhachkala, the capital of the Republic of Dagestan. This beautiful region in the North Caucasus has its own culture and a long history of resistance to Russia over the centuries. \n I left Dagestan in 2000 for the army after dropping out of college. My younger brother was drafted for mandatory military service and I decided to sign up as well, so he wouldn’t go alone. The Russian military is notorious for its hazing; racist attitudes toward Dagestanis and other “Black” people only make this terrible tradition even harder for them.\n Before the army, I never was called any of the racial slurs that are so common outside of the Caucasus. The city is very diverse; there are more than 36 different ethnic groups, and because of it, racial tension is uncommon. I’m Avar, which is technically Caucasian, but in Russia people like me from the Caucasus are often considered Black.\n It was particularly bad in the military base where I served because people there weren’t used to dealing with Dagestani men. As they hazed new recruits, Russians bent to their will, their norms. Dagestani men didn’t, so there were a lot of fights. I fought, too, and for one fight with an officer I was sent to the penal battalion for half a year. Soon after I got out, another Russian picked a fight with me and I ended up going to prison for three years for it. Many Dagestani serving in the military end up in prison this way.\n In 2000, I committed a “sin” — I voted for Putin during his first run for president. But just a few years later, in prison, I had a political awakening. I read newspapers, became interested in politics and realized how corrupt Putin and his close circle were. From the news stories, I saw that Putin was eliminating any political opposition, not a sign of a good leader. \n Soon after my release, I moved to St. Petersburg and for a couple of years was involved in local politics and went to protests — against Putin, the local government and anything else I found important. Over time less and less independent media became available. I lost belief in the Russian opposition. I realized what this government was long before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russians split into two groups who believed that Crimea was either Ukrainian or Russian. I think they are both wrong: Crimea belongs to the Crimean Tatars, its indigenous group. They should be the ones deciding Crimea’s fate. \n When it comes to mobilization, I should be exempt because I have four kids. But Russia has lost thousands of soldiers in this war and it desperately needs to plug this hole and recruit as much cannon fodder as possible. And I don’t trust the recruitment office; they trick people, they give you documents to sign and suddenly you are a contractor on the way to Ukraine. This is what’s happening back in Dagestan — they round up Dagestanis who are not supposed to be mobilized and try to get them to sign contracts. I think it’s disproportionally targeting Dagestan men and it’s just a new way to suppress the Caucasus region. Dagestan, however, fights back against the mobilization — there have been heated protests. Many Dagestani men have fled, and who can blame them? Islam doesn’t permit unlawful murders or participations in unjust wars. Of course, there are Dagestanis who align themselves with the government and support Putin, especially in the villages. They sold out.\n Maybe white Russians could do something about Putin. Maybe they could protest. I’m Black, I can’t go out and protest on their behalf. If I protest and get arrested, I can get charged with extremism. I hear people who have fled Russia speak eloquently about Putin and how all of this is his fault. But even if Russians overthrow Putin and install someone new like Alexei Navalny, it would be just a new führer — Russians are too focused on preserving what they perceive as Russianness, and that is whiteness.\n \n \n  \n   \n Konstantin Konkov\n Age: 22\n From: Moscow\n On Sept. 27, a recruiter and police officers stopped me outside of the government building where I work and tried to illegally give me a draft notice. I managed to stand my ground and be left alone.\n There are numerous reports of unlawful mobilization: Recruiters are not filling out draft notices correctly, recruiters are delivering notices to people who are supposed to be excluded from mobilization and people are being drafted even if they are not in the reserves. I’m a student, and my supporters and I tried to explain it to a recruiter outside of the Council of Deputies building where I work as a Mozhaysky District representative. The fact that I’m still a student is supposed to make me exempt from the mobilization despite my past military service, but it was tricky at the time — I’m not studying at the same university where I started after high school, which could have potentially negated my right to be excused because of my studies.\n Luckily, I and people who came out to support me didn’t get confused when a recruiter approached me; we demanded to see the documents that enabled him to give me a draft notice. It turned out he didn’t have a right to do so. Once he and his allies understood, they left. One of the videos of the incident went viral and it was perceived as a proper way to handle unlawful draft attempts.\n I got my first taste of activism at an early age. It was around 2012 and I was in middle school when I saw a flyer in my apartment building. It mentioned how the daughter of a government official received a token punishment for committing double murder and contrasted that against the long sentence meted out to a woman for throwing an empty plastic bottle at a cop during a protest. It struck me as unjust that this regular woman, a mother, could be sentenced to years in prison. I made copies of the flyer and hung them in my school. It was invigorating to see my schoolmates stop by and read it. A few years later, I became an activist — I have participated in protests and have been arrested a couple of times for it.\n After dropping out of college after my freshman year I went to the army. It was a challenging experience — soldiers of different ethnicities had tense relationships with one another and there were many fights. I came back in 2019. Since then I have worked on several political campaigns, volunteered for different causes and worked for non-profits. In 2020, I enrolled at the Russian State Agricultural University to study biology, and last month I won municipal elections as an independent candidate and became the Mozhaysky District Representative. I have this job now while I continue with my studies. Perhaps the delivery of the summons was connected to the desire of the pro-Putin representatives to get rid of me.\n \n \n  \n   \n Pavel\n Age: 39\n From: Tolyatti, Samara Oblast, Russia\n Mobilization didn’t come as a surprise — I knew our “Tsar” Vladimir Putin has been losing this meaningless war and it was just a matter of time until he needed more cannon fodder.

The war has been labeled a “special operation” thus far, which limits the reach of mobilization; however, once it becomes an official war, they can draft anyone.\n We decided I had to leave Russia as soon as possible. I left work, packed a small suitcase and took a taxi to a checkpoint in Mashtakov township on the border with Kazakhstan, about a 4-hour drive from Tolyatti.

Out of fear of retaliation from people in the line, the taxi driver wouldn’t take me closer to the border and would not take me to where the line started for people crossing on foot.

There is no other way to earn enough in Kazakhstan to pay for my family’s relocation from Russia and life abroad.\n   \n   \n Roman\n Age: 23\n From: Saint Petersburg, Russia\n I can’t even think of what would happen if I got drafted — the possibility of it is too scary.\n I moved to St. Petersburg from Volgograd after college two years ago.

Through my work as a bartender, I met a lot of interesting, socially and politically active people whose interest in politics started to rub off on me. However, it was the war in Ukraine that became a turning point for me, after which I became truly invested in politics and news.\n Many people I know upended their lives and left the country within a day of Putin announcing mobilization. One of the “sister bars” to the places where I work lost three out of four bartenders to emigration in about a week. Our management is understanding of the situation: to avoid military recruiters harassing us at our workplace, they fired us on paper. We continued working unofficially, feeling a bit more protected by the fact the recruiters wouldn’t come looking for us here.\n I’m not too worried for myself at the moment — I’m in category C for mobilization, meaning that I can be drafted, but I have health issues that should be taken into consideration. I shouldn’t be taken to combat but kept in administrative work and such. My health issues excused me from mandatory military service after college, but if the “military operation” were to become an official war, my health issues wouldn’t protect me from the draft.\n I try to be careful going about my day — there are patrol cars on the streets stopping every other car, and there are military recruiters checking military registration cards on the subway. If they get to me, I know how to protest it — I know where to appeal, what governor to write. There are stories of people being mobilized by mistake and being returned later. You just need to know where to complain.\n Many men who have fled the mobilization are the peaceful kind. They can’t fight in a war or fight the government in a radical way. There are people in Russia who are resisting — there are protests, and there are people setting the recruitment offices on fire. It’s just so much harder to overthrow the government in Russia than anywhere else.\n Now, I’m biding my time until I make enough money and renew my international passport to leave. I’m also waiting for my girlfriend to get her affairs in order before leaving.","dc:creator":"Anastasiia Carrier","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/83/23/d2fe41c14afbb3672aaa71acdf26/1-russiadepart-lede.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration by Jade Cuevas","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"The perspectives of these seven men offer a glimpse into the toll Putin’s war is having on ordinary Russians, particularly those who disagree with the Kremlin’s line.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/83/23/d2fe41c14afbb3672aaa71acdf26/1-russiadepart-lede.jpg"}}]},"content":"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine remains hugely popular in Russia, but his decision to draft 300,000 men has many fearing for their lives — and fleeing the country.","contentSnippet":"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine remains hugely popular in Russia, but his decision to draft 300,000 men has many fearing for their lives — and fleeing the country.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/14/russian-men-dodge-putin-draft-ukraine-00061579","isoDate":"2022-10-14T09:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"Podcast: Anderson Cooper explores the unexpected feelings that come after experiencing a loss","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/all-there-is-with-anderson-cooper/episodes/4273c25e-fc3b-450f-99b8-af320111295b","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/all-there-is-with-anderson-cooper/episodes/4273c25e-fc3b-450f-99b8-af320111295b"},{"creator":"Summer Lin","title":"'Coronageddon' returns with 91 Freeway closure in Corona this weekend","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-19/91-freeway-closed-corona-road-repaving","pubDate":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 18:19:22 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>All eastbound lanes of the 91 Freeway will be closed from 10 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday, according to the Riverside County Transportation Commission.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"All eastbound lanes of the 91 Freeway will be closed from 10 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday, according to the Riverside County Transportation Commission.","dc:creator":"Summer Lin","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a034d2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2600+0+0/resize/1500x1000!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F6f%2F078122524d24a809b54bf07a87af%2Fla-photos-1staff-777419-me-91-freeway-shootings-18-ajs.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Corona, CA - May 20: An aerial view of traffic on the 91 Freeway and the Green River Blvd. overpass in 91 Freeway on Thursday, May 20, 2021 in Corona, CA.

But standing in the back of the room, by a table of auction items — a red, white and blue Kate Spade bag, a Trump 2024 hat, a mug that said Trump “won” — it struck me that given the composition of the audience, this was a strange thing for a Republican Party chair to have to say. In this heavily conservative state, reminding Republicans to vote Republican would seem to signal a big problem in the GOP.</p> <p>Republicans were rattled earlier this year when Palin, a one-time political sensation and one of the GOP’s original populists, lost a special election for a vacant congressional seat to a Democrat, Mary Peltola. They pointed fingers at Alaska’s new ranked choice voting system, in which a voter’s second choice — if their preferred candidate fell short — could help decide the outcome. The system is meant to weed out extreme candidates, and true to form only about half of voters who supported Nick Begich III, a more traditionalist Republican and the candidate endorsed by the state party, <a href=\"https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/RcvDetailedReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666304148072,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666304148072,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/RcvDetailedReport.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f777-dc6e-a59f-f77779d80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;had marked Palin as their second choice&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f777-dc6e-a59f-f77779d80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">had marked Palin as their second choice</a>.</p> <p>The result was a repudiation of Palin, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384?s=20&amp;t=sITAR-eGytbqWxgXN9HucA\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;uniquely unpopular&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384?s=20&amp;t=sITAR-eGytbqWxgXN9HucA&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50cf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50cf0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">uniquely unpopular</a> figure in Alaska following her vice presidential candidacy in 2008 and her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;abrupt and not-well-explained&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50cf0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50cf0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">abrupt and not-well-explained</a> resignation from the Alaska governorship the following year.

And for the first time in nearly 50 years, Alaska had sent a Democrat to the House. It probably wouldn’t have happened without Alaska’s unusual ranked choice voting system. The state hadn’t turned Democratic overnight, after all. But it was possible that Palin’s loss had revealed something alarming for Republicans about the limitations of a MAGA personality’s appeal in the post-Donald Trump presidential era — not just in Alaska, but in the Lower 48, as well.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/d2/24/bba1bb3046a9b4b18dec3400c3b7/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>“It’s crazy,” said Jim Minnery, executive director of the conservative Alaska Family Council.</p> <p>“It was insane,” said Chris Berns, a commercial fisherman I met at a meet-and-greet hosted by the state’s moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. “I couldn’t even believe it.”</p> <p>Nor could many of the Republicans at the dinner in Wasilla, where Brown channeled Benjamin Franklin: “Republicans, if we don’t hang together, we are going to hang separately.”</p> <p>Even some Republicans in the room weren’t sure they could avoid it. The stakes had been lower in the special election, with Republicans ceding the seat to Peltola for a matter of months after the death of Rep. Don Young. But now in the regular election — in which Alaskans are about to run the same contest all over again for a full, two-year term — it isn’t clear anything had changed.</p> <p>Palin, who initially told her supporters not to rank a second choice on the ballot, has since changed tack. When I met her following a candidate debate on fisheries earlier this month, she told me she’d decided to “swallow my pride and say, ‘Go ahead and comply’” because “politically speaking, you’ve got to strategize to get second- and third-place votes.” She didn’t like doing it, though. It “goes against every competitive bone in my body,” Palin said. But “otherwise, the math,” she said, “it’ll just play out exactly as it just did.”</p> <p>But recognizing the math is one thing. Agreeing to a ceasefire is something else entirely — especially when Palin and Begich are essentially competing to finish second to Peltola in the first round of voting, only then hoping to leapfrog the Democrat when the second-place votes are tallied. It was only last month that Palin was calling on Begich to drop out of the race, disparaging him as “delusional” for suggesting that he — not Palin — was the only Republican who could win. She described him to me as engaging in “politics of personal destruction.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3c/f1/2f091f3d4b50a47c265145b3d5b3/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>All along — far before Palin got on board — Begich had encouraged his supporters to mark Palin second on their ballots. But he has also cast Palin as a “quitter” incapable of beating Peltola. And in his effort to contrast his candidacy with hers, he has not been above provocation. He has distributed buttons <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/from-gipper-to-hockey-mom-079150\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;poking Palin&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/from-gipper-to-hockey-mom-079150&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50d00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">poking Palin</a>’s brand that say, “Another hockey mom for Nick Begich.”</p> <p>In the parking lot of the restaurant where the Republicans met, Aaron Coman, the owner of a hit music station in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, shook his head at the animosity between the two Republicans. He said he’d appealed personally to both Palin’s and Begich’s campaigns to “stop beating each other up.”</p> <p>“If you continue to bash each other, we’re going to get another Mary Peltola win,” he said. “And that’s a fact.”</p> <p>But when I asked if he was confident the result would be any different in November, he said, “No.”</p> <p>Normally, a party goes through a primary, takes their shots at each other, and then coalesces around a nominee. But in Alaska, where ranked choice voting has everyone still running against one another, “really what it’s doing is splitting up the Republicans, in goodwill and also votes,” said Kathy McCollum, president of the Mat-Su Republican Women’s Club, which hosted the event where Brown spoke.</p> <p>She said, “It’s really caused a lot of grief.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>If Alaska’s voting system</b> is unusual, the issues and logistics of campaigning here are something else, too.</p> <p>One recent morning, Begich and Murkowski, piled onto the same Alaska Airlines flight from Anchorage to the city of Kodiak, located on an island about 30 miles off the coast where, despite the pilot’s warning that inclement weather might force them to turn back, they landed in heavy rain to attend, along with Palin and Peltola, a series of candidate debates focused on fisheries. (On the return flight, Begich and Murkowski shared a row, and Peltola sat across from them: “I’m on the inside, Nick,” Murkowski said when she boarded.)</p> <p>In a high school auditorium, the House candidates fielded <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-bycatch#:~:text=foster%20innovative%20solutions%3F-,What%20is%20bycatch%3F,or%20entangled%20in%20fishing%20gear.\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666304636148,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666304636148,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-bycatch#:~:text=foster%20innovative%20solutions%3F-,What%20is%20bycatch%3F,or%20entangled%20in%20fishing%20gear.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f77e-d8b3-afd3-f7ffeef20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;questions about bycatch&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f77e-d8b3-afd3-f7ffeef20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">questions about bycatch</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-science-lifestyle-business-environment-and-nature-cb0c966f43e52fd9559857969f1203a0\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;dwindling salmon populations&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-science-lifestyle-business-environment-and-nature-cb0c966f43e52fd9559857969f1203a0&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50d00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50d00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">dwindling salmon populations</a> and the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which governs fishing in federal waters, and about whether they had ever fished commercially, what kind of white fish is their favorite and, “How often do you eat seafood?”</p> <p>“I’d say I eat seafood about four or five times a week,” Peltola said. “And if I’m not eating seafood, I’m eating moose meat.”</p> <p>Murkowski, after de-planing in Kodiak, told me that ranked choice voting had introduced a “newfound freedom for individuals to be released from the construct that the parties had put in place.” For Murkowski, a pro-abortion rights Republican who supported Trump’s second impeachment, it’s the support of moderates, independents and crossover Democrats that has kept her in the Senate — and will keep her there if she can defeat a Trump-backed challenger, Kelly Tshibaka, in November.</p> <p>Ranked choice voting, Murkowski said, has “prompted the independence that I think is just inherent in Alaskans.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/7a/9b/26a26c3341d38e486ad31ef94cd5/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>This is the read of the House race in Alaska in much of the Lower 48, as well.

But sometimes personalities can detract from the message itself, and with some of these MAGA, cult-like personalities, independents are looking at whether they want that candidate not based on the issue set but based on personality.”</p> <p>That might all change if Republicans succeed in focusing more attention on the country’s economic woes, “because when they go up to fill up their car with gas, they’re pissed off,” Thomas said. “But it certainly is making it more of an uphill battle than it needs to be.”</p> <p>At the Donut King restaurant in Wasilla, where Begich hosted a gathering of supporters recently, I spoke with Matthew Hebb, a political strategist from Idaho who had traveled to Alaska to knock on doors for Begich. He was optimistic about Begich’s prospects on Nov. 8. But he told me that divisions in the GOP are already leading to electoral losses: “Republicans are going to lose some critical elections in places that are easily winnable through these separations, and they’re going to have to realize they have to learn how to get along.”</p> <p>In Alaska, the gulf between Palin and Begich supporters may simply be too wide. Palin’s problem is largely reputational — resented for leaving her governorship before her term was over or mocked for dancing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLwfHwR0ps\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in a pink bear costume on TV&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLwfHwR0ps&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50d10008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf50d10009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">in a pink bear costume on TV</a>. Begich, the scion of one of the most prominent <i>Democratic</i> families in Alaska, is saddled with his family name.</p> <p>The grandson of the late Rep. Nick Begich Sr. and nephew of former Sen. Mark Begich, Begich was raised by his mother’s conservative side of the family. He was co-chair of Young’s 2020 reelection campaign and of the Alaska Republican Party’s finance committee. He told me he would have voted to certify the 2020 presidential election, and he is otherwise within the mainstream of the GOP.</p> <p>Still, Mike Shower, a Republican state senator who was at Begich’s gathering at the donut shop, said, “What I have heard people say to me specifically is I will never vote for a Begich … If he was Nick Johnson, he would have probably won this hands down.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a4/0f/0c33fa3740908952c408ef728747/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary5.png\"> <br> <p>Shower said that after Peltola’s victory, “People have asked the question, ‘What the heck happened?’” And he was optimistic that “we will convince a certain number of people to put Nick and Sarah down as one and two in whatever order works for them, and I’m hoping that that’s going to push us across the edge this time.”</p> <p>Mead Treadwell, the state’s former Republican lieutenant governor, said that ever since the special election, “there has really been a concerted effort by a number of people” to push the party’s message of “rank the red” — that is, pick a Republican as the second choice. However, he said, “How well it works is a good question, because it’s not up to the party, it’s up to the voters.”</p> <p>And what do they think? In the closing leg of the House campaign — at the restaurant fundraiser in Wasilla, at a hockey game and at church with Begich and at gatherings of Republicans in Kodiak and in Anchorage — I ran into many Republicans who <i>do</i> plan to fall in line with the party, ranking Begich and Palin first and second, or vice versa. But there was no shortage of conservatives who still refuse to. They say things like:</p> <p><i>“It’s just going to be Sarah.”</i></p> <p><i>“Sarah can’t win, so you’ve got to put Nick first.”</i></p> <p><i>“No second choice.”</i></p> <p><i>“Palin has a louder voice, but man, that voice is so hard to listen to.”</i></p> <p><i>“If we put Sarah in there, I feel [God] is going to punish us.”</i></p> <p><i>“I just wanted to come to a hockey game and get away from the politics.”</i><br></p> <br> <p><b>On the night of </b>the fisheries debate in Kodiak, Palin and Peltola wore matching earrings shaped like buoys. The two politicians were friendly from when Palin’s time as governor overlapped with Peltola’s tenure in the state legislature, and Peltola, Palin said, had given her a pair.</p> <p>“I love her,” Palin said. “We just represent two different parties, obviously, but two different platforms.” The competition isn’t “personal,” Palin said. “I think it’s an Alaska chick thing, too … It’s like, we support each other.”</p> <p>The difficulty for Palin — and for the Republican Party here — is that Alaskans may like Peltola just as much as she does.</p> <p>In her campaign literature, Peltola presents herself as “pro-choice,” “pro-fish” and “pro-jobs.” In her TV advertising, she appeals to moderates, casting herself as a defender of Alaska as a “resource extraction state.” She has a bumper sticker that reads, “Made of Salmon” and a flyer carried by door-knockers suggests people “vote for a REGULAR ALASKAN.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/85/1b/60e173c34fed8ce3f52e95ec1797/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p>Her campaign is resonating. In a recent poll by longtime Alaska pollster Ivan Moore of Alaska Survey Research, Peltola’s favorability rating hit 53 percent.

I think Alaskans, I think Americans are just sick and tired of hearing people squabbling … I do not take any pleasure in that.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/cd/dc/6e8e9554470bb7304ca5cb085eea/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary7.png\"> <br> <p>But other Democrats are reveling in it.</p> <p>Pat Chesbro, the Democrat running against Murkowski and Tshibaka in the U.S. Senate campaign, will almost certainly lose her race. But in the House contest, Chesbro said, Peltola is “so good,” even if she “would not have done well without ranked choice voting.”</p> <p>“The interesting thing,” Chesbro said, “is if you have a party whose two candidates fight each other, that gives an advantage to the other person in a three-way race.”</p> <p>Nobody knows that better than Republicans in Alaska. Cynthia Henry, the Republican national committeewoman from the state, said Peltola’s victory was a “rude awakening for folks.”</p> <p>Leaving the debate in Kodiak last week, Palin, amid a handful of photograph seekers, was met by a fisherman who commiserated with her about the system.</p> <p>“Ugghhhh,” she said when I asked her about it. “It’s not good.”<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"WASILLA, Alaska — In a restaurant ballroom just up the road from Sarah Palin’s home on Lake Lucille, a room full of Republicans one recent Saturday night hung golden balloons from a paneled ceiling, lined up at the bar and held a drawing for a “wall of guns.”\n The event was a fundraiser for a local Republican women’s group, and one of the speakers, Ann Brown, the state Republican Party chair, had a very specific ask.\n Vote for Republicans in November’s ranked choice election, she said, “and no Democrats or any other party.”\n The crowd applauded. But standing in the back of the room, by a table of auction items — a red, white and blue Kate Spade bag, a Trump 2024 hat, a mug that said Trump “won” — it struck me that given the composition of the audience, this was a strange thing for a Republican Party chair to have to say. In this heavily conservative state, reminding Republicans to vote Republican would seem to signal a big problem in the GOP.\n Republicans were rattled earlier this year when Palin, a one-time political sensation and one of the GOP’s original populists, lost a special election for a vacant congressional seat to a Democrat, Mary Peltola. They pointed fingers at Alaska’s new ranked choice voting system, in which a voter’s second choice — if their preferred candidate fell short — could help decide the outcome. The system is meant to weed out extreme candidates, and true to form only about half of voters who supported Nick Begich III, a more traditionalist Republican and the candidate endorsed by the state party, had marked Palin as their second choice.\n The result was a repudiation of Palin, a uniquely unpopular figure in Alaska following her vice presidential candidacy in 2008 and her abrupt and not-well-explained resignation from the Alaska governorship the following year. But the special election also laid bare exactly how much Republicans were willing to lose in the seemingly ceaseless feud between the party’s Trumpian and more establishment-minded bases of support.\n Independents — a majority of the Alaska electorate and a critical set of voters to both parties in more competitive states — had pulled away from Palin. In a state that Donald Trump carried by 10 percentage points in 2020, Alaska’s closest approximation to the former president hit a wall. And for the first time in nearly 50 years, Alaska had sent a Democrat to the House. It probably wouldn’t have happened without Alaska’s unusual ranked choice voting system. The state hadn’t turned Democratic overnight, after all. But it was possible that Palin’s loss had revealed something alarming for Republicans about the limitations of a MAGA personality’s appeal in the post-Donald Trump presidential era — not just in Alaska, but in the Lower 48, as well.\n \n  \n “It’s crazy,” said Jim Minnery, executive director of the conservative Alaska Family Council.\n “It was insane,” said Chris Berns, a commercial fisherman I met at a meet-and-greet hosted by the state’s moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. “I couldn’t even believe it.”\n Nor could many of the Republicans at the dinner in Wasilla, where Brown channeled Benjamin Franklin: “Republicans, if we don’t hang together, we are going to hang separately.”\n Even some Republicans in the room weren’t sure they could avoid it. The stakes had been lower in the special election, with Republicans ceding the seat to Peltola for a matter of months after the death of Rep. Don Young. But now in the regular election — in which Alaskans are about to run the same contest all over again for a full, two-year term — it isn’t clear anything had changed.\n Palin, who initially told her supporters not to rank a second choice on the ballot, has since changed tack. When I met her following a candidate debate on fisheries earlier this month, she told me she’d decided to “swallow my pride and say, ‘Go ahead and comply’” because “politically speaking, you’ve got to strategize to get second- and third-place votes.” She didn’t like doing it, though. It “goes against every competitive bone in my body,” Palin said. But “otherwise, the math,” she said, “it’ll just play out exactly as it just did.”\n But recognizing the math is one thing. Agreeing to a ceasefire is something else entirely — especially when Palin and Begich are essentially competing to finish second to Peltola in the first round of voting, only then hoping to leapfrog the Democrat when the second-place votes are tallied. It was only last month that Palin was calling on Begich to drop out of the race, disparaging him as “delusional” for suggesting that he — not Palin — was the only Republican who could win. She described him to me as engaging in “politics of personal destruction.”\n \n  \n All along — far before Palin got on board — Begich had encouraged his supporters to mark Palin second on their ballots. But he has also cast Palin as a “quitter” incapable of beating Peltola. And in his effort to contrast his candidacy with hers, he has not been above provocation. He has distributed buttons poking Palin’s brand that say, “Another hockey mom for Nick Begich.”\n In the parking lot of the restaurant where the Republicans met, Aaron Coman, the owner of a hit music station in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, shook his head at the animosity between the two Republicans. He said he’d appealed personally to both Palin’s and Begich’s campaigns to “stop beating each other up.”\n “If you continue to bash each other, we’re going to get another Mary Peltola win,” he said. “And that’s a fact.”\n But when I asked if he was confident the result would be any different in November, he said, “No.”\n Normally, a party goes through a primary, takes their shots at each other, and then coalesces around a nominee. But in Alaska, where ranked choice voting has everyone still running against one another, “really what it’s doing is splitting up the Republicans, in goodwill and also votes,” said Kathy McCollum, president of the Mat-Su Republican Women’s Club, which hosted the event where Brown spoke.\n She said, “It’s really caused a lot of grief.”\n \n If Alaska’s voting system is unusual, the issues and logistics of campaigning here are something else, too.\n One recent morning, Begich and Murkowski, piled onto the same Alaska Airlines flight from Anchorage to the city of Kodiak, located on an island about 30 miles off the coast where, despite the pilot’s warning that inclement weather might force them to turn back, they landed in heavy rain to attend, along with Palin and Peltola, a series of candidate debates focused on fisheries. (On the return flight, Begich and Murkowski shared a row, and Peltola sat across from them: “I’m on the inside, Nick,” Murkowski said when she boarded.)\n In a high school auditorium, the House candidates fielded questions about bycatch, dwindling salmon populations and the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which governs fishing in federal waters, and about whether they had ever fished commercially, what kind of white fish is their favorite and, “How often do you eat seafood?”\n “I’d say I eat seafood about four or five times a week,” Peltola said. “And if I’m not eating seafood, I’m eating moose meat.”\n Murkowski, after de-planing in Kodiak, told me that ranked choice voting had introduced a “newfound freedom for individuals to be released from the construct that the parties had put in place.” For Murkowski, a pro-abortion rights Republican who supported Trump’s second impeachment, it’s the support of moderates, independents and crossover Democrats that has kept her in the Senate — and will keep her there if she can defeat a Trump-backed challenger, Kelly Tshibaka, in November.\n Ranked choice voting, Murkowski said, has “prompted the independence that I think is just inherent in Alaskans.”\n \n  \n This is the read of the House race in Alaska in much of the Lower 48, as well. To them, the failure of Republicans to hold Alaska’s House seat is all about ranked choice voting — or the weirdness of the vast, sparsely populated 49th state.\n “Alaska’s kind of its own, different animal up there,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster. “I think a lot of it, it’s personality-driven in a place like that.”\n But Alaska is not the only state where the politics of personality are being tested in the GOP, and it’s possible that the difficulties Republicans are having here are less an outlier than an early indication of a specific problem for the party in states where Republicans have nominated candidates as polarizing as Palin — and where independents are keeping Democrats afloat.\n \n \n \nRepublicans are still widely expected to win the House in November. But the large number of voters who are unaffiliated with either party in Alaska — about 58 percent — may be telling the GOP something about its future in more competitive states, as well. The proportion of people nationally who identify as independent has been growing in recent decades, according to Gallup, now accounting for about 43 percent of American adults. That may not be a problem for Republicans broadly in November. In a New York Times/Siena College poll that was ricocheting around Democratic Party circles this week, independents were breaking for Republicans by a 10 percentage point margin over Democrats on the generic congressional ballot.\n But the polling is mixed. One recent CBS News/YouGov survey showed independents favoring Democrats over Republicans in congressional elections by a narrow margin. President Joe Biden’s approval rating — a measure closely tied to a party’s performance in the midterms — is still dismal with independent voters, at 39 percent, according to an NPR/Marist poll released earlier this month. Still, that’s a dramatic improvement from July, when his approval rating among independents was 11 percentage points worse.\n \n Where Republicans do appear vulnerable with independents are places the party is running candidates like Trump, who carried independents by 6 percentage points in 2016, according to exit polls, before losing them to Biden by 13 percentage points four years later. There are a lot of similar hard-liners running this year, including in Alaska, where independents are far more likely to view Peltola favorably than Palin: The Democrat is running 26 percentage points ahead of Palin with independents who rank at least one of them, according to one recent poll.\n And in other states where Republicans have nominated Trumpian standard-bearers, it’s a similar story. It’s one reason Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is making a competitive run for Senate in Republican-heavy Ohio, where a Marist Poll last month had Ryan up 2 percentage points over Republican J.D. Vance with independents. In Georgia’s Senate race, Republican Herschel Walker is running 15 percentage points behind Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock among independents, according to a Quinnipiac University poll, while incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, a more traditionalist Republican, is faring far better. In Pennsylvania, Republican Mehmet Oz is down double digits among independents, as well.\n Those numbers may shift back toward Republicans as Election Day nears and partisan leanings solidify. But between moderate Republicans defecting from Trumpian Republicans like Palin and the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade — just as much an issue in Alaska as anywhere else, with polls suggesting a majority of Alaskans support abortion rights — the most polarizing Republicans, like Palin, have reason for concern.\n \n  \n What may be happening in Alaska and elsewhere, said Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster, is that “things are collapsing toward the middle.”\n “The galaxies have been running away from each other for a good decade or more, and maybe now they’re spinning back a little bit more toward each other,” he said, in what he called a potential “regression to the mean.”\n John Thomas, a Republican strategist who works on House campaigns across the country, said, “My take on it is that sometimes personalities can be incredibly useful in politics. But sometimes personalities can detract from the message itself, and with some of these MAGA, cult-like personalities, independents are looking at whether they want that candidate not based on the issue set but based on personality.”\n That might all change if Republicans succeed in focusing more attention on the country’s economic woes, “because when they go up to fill up their car with gas, they’re pissed off,” Thomas said. “But it certainly is making it more of an uphill battle than it needs to be.”\n At the Donut King restaurant in Wasilla, where Begich hosted a gathering of supporters recently, I spoke with Matthew Hebb, a political strategist from Idaho who had traveled to Alaska to knock on doors for Begich. He was optimistic about Begich’s prospects on Nov. 8. But he told me that divisions in the GOP are already leading to electoral losses: “Republicans are going to lose some critical elections in places that are easily winnable through these separations, and they’re going to have to realize they have to learn how to get along.”\n In Alaska, the gulf between Palin and Begich supporters may simply be too wide. Palin’s problem is largely reputational — resented for leaving her governorship before her term was over or mocked for dancing in a pink bear costume on TV. Begich, the scion of one of the most prominent Democratic families in Alaska, is saddled with his family name.\n The grandson of the late Rep. Nick Begich Sr. and nephew of former Sen. Mark Begich, Begich was raised by his mother’s conservative side of the family. He was co-chair of Young’s 2020 reelection campaign and of the Alaska Republican Party’s finance committee. He told me he would have voted to certify the 2020 presidential election, and he is otherwise within the mainstream of the GOP.\n Still, Mike Shower, a Republican state senator who was at Begich’s gathering at the donut shop, said, “What I have heard people say to me specifically is I will never vote for a Begich … If he was Nick Johnson, he would have probably won this hands down.”\n \n  \n Shower said that after Peltola’s victory, “People have asked the question, ‘What the heck happened?’” And he was optimistic that “we will convince a certain number of people to put Nick and Sarah down as one and two in whatever order works for them, and I’m hoping that that’s going to push us across the edge this time.”\n Mead Treadwell, the state’s former Republican lieutenant governor, said that ever since the special election, “there has really been a concerted effort by a number of people” to push the party’s message of “rank the red” — that is, pick a Republican as the second choice. However, he said, “How well it works is a good question, because it’s not up to the party, it’s up to the voters.”\n And what do they think? In the closing leg of the House campaign — at the restaurant fundraiser in Wasilla, at a hockey game and at church with Begich and at gatherings of Republicans in Kodiak and in Anchorage — I ran into many Republicans who do plan to fall in line with the party, ranking Begich and Palin first and second, or vice versa. But there was no shortage of conservatives who still refuse to. They say things like:\n “It’s just going to be Sarah.”\n “Sarah can’t win, so you’ve got to put Nick first.”\n “No second choice.”\n “Palin has a louder voice, but man, that voice is so hard to listen to.”\n “If we put Sarah in there, I feel [God] is going to punish us.”\n “I just wanted to come to a hockey game and get away from the politics.”\n \n On the night of the fisheries debate in Kodiak, Palin and Peltola wore matching earrings shaped like buoys. The two politicians were friendly from when Palin’s time as governor overlapped with Peltola’s tenure in the state legislature, and Peltola, Palin said, had given her a pair.\n “I love her,” Palin said. “We just represent two different parties, obviously, but two different platforms.” The competition isn’t “personal,” Palin said. “I think it’s an Alaska chick thing, too … It’s like, we support each other.”\n The difficulty for Palin — and for the Republican Party here — is that Alaskans may like Peltola just as much as she does.\n In her campaign literature, Peltola presents herself as “pro-choice,” “pro-fish” and “pro-jobs.” In her TV advertising, she appeals to moderates, casting herself as a defender of Alaska as a “resource extraction state.” She has a bumper sticker that reads, “Made of Salmon” and a flyer carried by door-knockers suggests people “vote for a REGULAR ALASKAN.”\n \n  \n Her campaign is resonating. In a recent poll by longtime Alaska pollster Ivan Moore of Alaska Survey Research, Peltola’s favorability rating hit 53 percent. Moore said on Twitter at the time that she “is categorically the most popular figure in AK right now.” Peltola, Moore told me, is “in the midst of a pretty good little honeymoon going on,” while Palin and Begich “haven’t really been very smart between the two of them, just going at each other.”\n Recent polling suggests Palin and Begich are once again splitting the Republican vote — Palin with a fervent base of support, but not enough to lift her above 50 percent. Which is, after all, part of the idea driving more states to consider ranked choice voting, something Nevada voters will weigh in on in November. Proponents believe it helps boost more likable, less-partisan candidates over polarizing ones. The more extremist and uncompromising, the more likely a party is to lose.\n The problem for Republicans isn’t the party, Begich said, but Palin, whose polling is so polarizing that it would be for her “almost impossible to win a general election.”\n When I suggested to Peltola, the first Alaska Native elected to Congress, that she must be enjoying the self-harm the other side is inflicting on itself, she insisted that she isn’t. “No, I actually don’t love it, no,” she said. “Because I think that it turns off voters. I think Alaskans, I think Americans are just sick and tired of hearing people squabbling … I do not take any pleasure in that.”\n \n  \n But other Democrats are reveling in it.\n Pat Chesbro, the Democrat running against Murkowski and Tshibaka in the U.S. Senate campaign, will almost certainly lose her race. But in the House contest, Chesbro said, Peltola is “so good,” even if she “would not have done well without ranked choice voting.”\n “The interesting thing,” Chesbro said, “is if you have a party whose two candidates fight each other, that gives an advantage to the other person in a three-way race.”\n Nobody knows that better than Republicans in Alaska. Cynthia Henry, the Republican national committeewoman from the state, said Peltola’s victory was a “rude awakening for folks.”\n Leaving the debate in Kodiak last week, Palin, amid a handful of photograph seekers, was met by a fisherman who commiserated with her about the system.\n “Ugghhhh,” she said when I asked her about it. “It’s not good.”","dc:creator":"David Siders","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/cc/48/888534374838916eaa1ef92ba21c/mag.Siders.AlaskaIllustration.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/AP Photos/iStock","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Mag.TFR.Siders.AlaskaIllustration","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/cc/48/888534374838916eaa1ef92ba21c/mag.Siders.AlaskaIllustration.jpg"}}]},"content":"Liberated by ranked choice voting, they seem poised to swing dramatically toward Democrats.

Ukraine has shown itself to be a far more robust military force than pretty much anyone predicted. Talk has changed from wondering how long Ukraine could hold out to how much territory it can retake — and to when and how the war will end.</p> <p>But it’s still hard to imagine how Putin’s war on Ukraine will conclude. Does Putin even have an endgame? If he really wants to control Ukrainian territory, why does he seem so bent on destroying it?</p> <p>To get insights into these questions, I reached out to Fiona Hill, one of America’s most clear-eyed observers of Russia and Putin, who served as an adviser to former President Donald Trump and gained fame for her testimony in his first impeachment trial. In the early days of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Hill warned <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in an interview with POLITICO&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">in an interview with POLITICO</a> that what Putin was trying to do was not only seize Ukraine but destroy the current world order. And she recognized from the start that Putin would use the threat of nuclear conflict to try to get his way.</p> <p>Now, despite the setbacks Russia has suffered on the battlefield, Hill thinks Putin is undaunted. She sees him adapting to new conditions, not giving up. And she sees him trying to get the West to accede to his aims by using messengers like billionaire Elon Musk to propose arrangements that would end the conflict on his terms.</p> <p>“Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they're just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin,” Hill says.</p> <p>But while Putin appears to be doubling down in Ukraine, the conflict poses some real dangers to his leadership. He has identified himself quite directly with the war, Hill notes, and he can’t afford to look like a loser. If he begins to lose support from Russian elites, his hold on power could slip.</p> <p>The West has come a long way since February in understanding the stakes in Ukraine, Hill says, but the world still hasn’t totally grasped the full challenge Putin is posing. Putin must be contained, Hill says, but that won’t happen unless and until international institutions established in the wake of World War II evolve so they <i>can</i> contain him. And that conversation is only just beginning.</p> <p>“This is a great power conflict, the third great power conflict in the European space in a little over a century,” Hill says. “It's the end of the existing world order. Our world is not going to be the same as it was before.”</p> <p><i>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><b>Reynolds:</b> The war clearly hasn't gone as Putin originally intended. How has Putin reacted to his setbacks and how do you think his mindset is evolving?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>Whenever he has a setback, Putin figures he can get out of it, that he can turn things around. That’s partly because of his training as a KGB operative. In the past, when asked about the success of operations, he’s pooh-poohed the idea that operations always go as planned, that everything is always perfect. He says there are always problems in an operation, there are always setbacks. Sometimes they’re absolute disasters. The key is adaptation.</p> <p>Another hallmark of Putin is that he doubles down. He always takes the more extreme step in his range of options, the one that actually cuts off other alternatives. Putin has often related an experience he had as a kid, when he trapped a rat in a corner in the apartment building he lived in, in Leningrad, and the rat shocked him by jumping out and fighting back. He tells this story as if it's a story about himself, that if he's ever cornered, he will always fight back.</p> <p>But he's also the person who puts himself in the corner. We know that the Russians have had very high casualties and that they've been running out of manpower and equipment in Ukraine. The casualty rate on the Russian side keeps mounting. A few months ago, estimates were 50,000.

This is a real blow given the 170,000 Russia troops deployed to the Ukrainian border when the invasion began.</p> <p>So, what does Putin do? He sends even more troops in by launching a full-on mobilization. He still hasn't said this is a war. It remains a “special military operation,” but he calls up 300,000 people. Then, he goes several steps further and announces the annexation of the territories that Russia has been fighting over for the last several months, not just Donetsk and Luhansk, but also the territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p> <p>Putin gives himself no way out except to pursue the original goals he had when he went in, which is the dismemberment of Ukraine and Russia annexing its territory.

His endgame is to go out of this war on his terms. What we're seeing right now, with the annexations and the big speech that he made on September 30th is very clear. He sees this conflict as a full-on war with the West, and he still is adamant on removing Ukraine from the map and from global affairs.</p> <p>It's also clear that he has no intention whatsoever of giving up Donetsk and Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as Crimea, which he's already taken and already declared as part of Russia for time immemorial.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>Why does Putin want all that territory?

Or does he really want to rule this part of modern-day Ukraine in concrete, practical ways?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>It's actually both of those things. They are inextricably linked. You mentioned this idea of Novorossiya, “New Russia.” I think most people have forgotten that he used this term in 2014. Back then, the Kremlin triggered the war in Donbas as part of an effort to regain control of the territories of Novorossiya that were first annexed from the Ottoman Empire by Catherine the Great back in the late 18th century.</p> <p>There wasn't really a lot of settlement there then, and that’s how we got Potemkin villages — Prince Grigory Potemkin took Catherine on a carriage ride through her new dominion and they created fake villages, with peasants brought in to wave at the empress as she went by.</p> <p>We have this same issue now — what and who is Putin presiding over? Even Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, recently admitted that Russia hasn’t quite worked out the borders of the annexed areas yet, because the Ukrainians have been pushing back. The question of what Russia actually controls beyond all the symbolism of annexation is still a major question.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>If Putin wants Ukrainian territory so badly, why is he raining down such destruction on civilian areas and committing so many human rights abuses in occupied areas?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>This is punishment, but also perverse redevelopment. You cow people into submission, destroy what they had and all their links to their past and their old lives, and then make them into something new and, thus, yours. Destroy Ukraine and Ukrainians. Build New Russia and create Russians. Its brutal but also a hallmark of imperial conquest.</p> <p><b>Reynolds:</b> And it’s how they did it in the 18th century.</p> <p><b>Hill:</b> Exactly. Putin would love to control the territory. But control involves actually having people on your side. And that is really a big question. We've seen in all of these territories, Russia shipping people out or detaining them, from entire families and children to teachers, administrators and local police, and then proxy citizens sent in from Russia itself.</p> <p>Putin's initial goal when he launched the invasion was the collapse of central Ukrainian authority, the imposition of a puppet government in Kyiv, and all local governments swearing allegiance to Moscow, probably with some political commissar-type proxy leaders put in place around the country — the kind of thing that we saw happening in 2014 in the Russian-occupied territories of Donetsk and Lugansk and Crimea. But of course, that didn't happen. So the problem that Putin has is controlling people in these territories rather than playing his own version of Potemkin villages.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>We've recently had Elon Musk step into this conflict trying to promote discussion of peace settlements. What do you make of the role that he's playing?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>It's very clear that Elon Musk is transmitting a message for Putin. There was a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/11/business/elon-musk-ian-bremmer-putin-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;conference in Aspen in late September&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/11/business/elon-musk-ian-bremmer-putin-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">conference in Aspen in late September</a> when Musk offered a version of what was in his tweet — including the recognition of Crimea as Russian because it’s been mostly Russian since the 1780s — and the suggestion that the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia should be up for negotiation, because there should be guaranteed water supplies to Crimea. He made this suggestion before Putin’s annexation of those two territories on September 30. It was a very specific reference. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia essentially control all the water supplies to Crimea. Crimea is a dry peninsula. It has aquifers, but it doesn't have rivers. It’s dependent on water from the Dnipro River that flows through a canal from Kherson. It’s unlikely Elon Musk knows about this himself. The reference to water is so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin.</p> <p>Now, there are several reasons why Musk’s intervention is interesting and significant. First of all, Putin does this frequently. He uses prominent people as intermediaries to feel out the general political environment, to basically test how people are going to react to ideas. Henry Kissinger, for example, has had interactions with Putin directly and relayed messages. Putin often uses various trusted intermediaries including all kinds of businesspeople. I had intermediaries sent to discuss things with me while I was in government.</p> <p>This is a classic Putin play. It's just fascinating, of course, that it's Elon Musk in this instance, because obviously Elon Musk has a huge Twitter following. He's got a longstanding reputation in Russia through Tesla, the SpaceX space programs and also through Starlink. He's one of the most popular men in opinion polls in Russia. At the same time, he's played a very important part in supporting Ukraine by providing Starlink internet systems to Ukraine, and kept telecommunications going in Ukraine, paid for in part by the U.S. government. Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they're just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>Putin is very comfortable dealing with billionaires and oligarchs. That's a world that he knows well. But by using Musk this way, he goes right over the heads of [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government.</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process. He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/be/36/6042d6b34322b2492dd74dfaa146/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1211442364\"> <br> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>You have compared Putin's invasion of Ukraine to Hitler's invasions of other countries in World War II, of Czechoslovakia, of Poland. Do you still see it that way? Do you think that Putin has become Hitler-like in how he thinks of himself and how he seeks territory?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>Yes, but also like Kaiser Wilhelm in World War I as well. Look, exactly 100 years before Putin annexed Crimea in 2014, in 1914, the Germans invaded Belgium and France and World War I was fought as a Great Power conflict to eject Germany from Belgium and France. And World War II in Europe, of course, was a refighting territorially of many of the outcomes of World War I.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that conceptually, people have a hard time with the idea of a world war. It brings all kinds of horrors to mind — the Holocaust and the detonation of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the dawning of the nuclear age. But if you think about it, a world war is a great power conflict over territory which overturns the existing international order and where other states find themselves on different sides of the conflict. It involves economic warfare, information warfare, as well as kinetic war.</p> <p>We're in the same situation. Again, Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, exactly 100 years after Germany invaded Belgium and France — and just in the same way that Hitler seized the Sudetenland, annexed Austria and invaded Poland. We're having a hard time coming to terms with what we're dealing with here. This is a great power conflict, the third great power conflict in the European space in a little over a century. It's the end of the existing world order. Our world is not going to be the same as it was before.</p> <p>People worry about this being dangerous hyperbole. But we have to really accept what the situation is to be able to respond appropriately. Each war has been fought differently. Modern wars involve information space and cyberspace, and we've seen all of these at play here. And, in the 21st century, these are economic and financial wars. We're all-in on the financial and economic side of things.</p> <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned global energy and food security on its head because of the way Russia is leveraging gas and oil and the blockade Putin has imposed in the Black Sea against Ukrainian grain exports. Russia has not just targeted Ukrainian agricultural production, as well as port facilities for exporting grain, but caused a global food crisis. These are global effects of what is very clearly not just a regional war.</p> <p>Keep in mind that Putin himself has used the language of both world wars. He's talked about the fact that Ukraine did not exist as a state until after World War I, after the dissolution of the Russian Empire and the creation of the Soviet Union. He has blamed the early Soviets for the formation of what he calls an artificial state. Right from the very beginning, Putin himself has said that he is refighting World War II. So, the hyperbole has come from Vladimir Putin, who has said that he's reversing all of the outcomes territorially from World War I and also, in effect, World War II and the Cold War. He's not accepting the territorial configuration of Europe as it currently is.</p> <p>What we have to figure out now is, how are we going to contend with this?</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>China and India, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders who have not exactly been with West on this — how do you think their views of what Russia is doing is changing?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>This is another global dimension. Just before the invasion, at the Beijing Olympics, we had Xi Jinping and Putin standing in seeming solidarity, talking about a limitless partnership, and Xi Jinping being very explicit in terms of Chinese opposition to the expansion of NATO and the role of NATO in the world. Clearly, at that point, Xi and China didn't expect that Vladimir Putin's special military operation would turn into the largest military action in Europe since World War II. Now, Xi Jinping is leery about showing any kind of diminution of his support for Vladimir Putin and Russia, since that would suggest he made a major miscalculation in lending Putin support. We haven't seen Xi repudiating Putin and Russia directly. But we've certainly seen some signs of concern. At a meeting in Central Asia around the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Putin himself acknowledged that China had concerns. We're pretty sure at this point that the Chinese also don't like Vladimir Putin's nuclear saber rattling in the context of the war in Ukraine, because that destabilizes the larger strategic balance globally, not just in Europe.</p> <p>For India, this has been a nightmare, frankly, and they've been trying to straddle the fence and figure out a balance. They don’t want to get on the wrong side of the United States or Ukraine, or Russia, and they just don't really know quite what to do. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Modi has said explicitly to Putin, look, this is a time for peace, not war. And being much more outspoken on the issue of the conflict than perhaps some might have anticipated. That's not insignificant.</p> <p>Once we get past the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63226230\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;party Congress&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63226230&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">party Congress</a> in China, we should watch how the Chinese-Russian relationship plays out. China would be instrumental in signaling to Putin how far he can go in terms of pursuing his endgame.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>Let's talk about the situation inside Russia. Do you think Putin was surprised by the wave of protests that followed his announcement of what he called a partial mobilization? Or was he expecting that?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>Yes, he was expecting pushback which is why he called it partial when it’s really a stealth full mobilization. The goal is to try to get the military up to full strength and get everybody he possibly can. The problem is that all these new forces are not battle ready. Many have had minimal military training. It’s very clear that most of them are going to be used as cannon fodder.</p> <p>Putin’s responding not just to the setbacks on the battlefield, but to setbacks in the information war in the domestic arena. He's getting pushback from <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/russias-party-war-seeks-turn-war-ukraine-national-cause-it-will-fail\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the party of war&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/russias-party-war-seeks-turn-war-ukraine-national-cause-it-will-fail&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51470007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">the party of war</a>. We have to remember there were nationalists since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s who wanted to retake Ukraine, not just Crimea, and reabsorb all the Russian-speaking territories. People in the cohort around Putin have pushed the invasion of Ukraine for some considerable period of time, and he has to keep them on his side. They are not satisfied. They want Ukraine dismembered.</p> <p>The shock, perhaps, is how many Russians have fled the mobilization. Although Russian authorities have been going to the borders to forcibly conscript people lining up to leave, they still haven’t taken the step of closing all the borders off. Putin and the Kremlin are aware that they would get a massive backlash if they did. We’ve already seen violence in Dagestan and other places where ethnic minorities have borne the brunt of recruitment. I think they are very, very aware that they've got to leave a safety valve open because otherwise there might be more protests, and more violence in response to the mobilization.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>If there are more protests and more violence, does that pose a threat to Putin as leader? How weak or vulnerable is Putin's position right now?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>Back to the Soviet period, there were tens of thousands of violent protests across the Soviet Union over the years. This didn’t lead to the disintegration of the Soviet Union because of severe repression. It was something messy they had to deal with. They decapitated the opposition, and that's what Putin's done. Russia is back to the USSR. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in isolation in a penal colony. The repressive capacity of the government is pretty significant. They’ve been taking thousands of people off the streets and putting them in jail. I think Putin feels he can decapitate any organized opposition. He has to just be careful to control the sheer number of opposition protests, which is, again, why they're keeping the safety valves open.</p> <p>Putin knows Russian history. World War I did lead to mass protests. The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War earlier in the 1900s also led to mass protests that got out of hand and discredited the czarist system. All of this could discredit him. So, there is some real risk. What he's making sure of is that there's no one who could lead these protests and make them coalesce.</p> <p>If you think back to when Navalny was poisoned in 2020, he was out in the Urals region and Siberia, pulling together opposition groups at a time when there were many protests going on in Russia. He was poisoned because he was getting some traction.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the mobilization chips away at Putin’s popularity because people feel that they've got no hope. They're no longer able to watch the war on their TV screens and switch it off and forget it's happening. They're forced to confront it. Support for the war was already fairly passive, but active support for the war is declining and support for Putin himself will decline as well. And he's got to keep placating the hardliners. So, he's got to take extreme actions.</p> <p>You're going to start hearing more and more stories of people who've gone to the front completely unprepared and got killed. That will reduce tolerance for the special military operation. If that happens, it could impact Putin's standing among the elite. He's been pretty much unassailable as long as he's been the only really truly popular politician in Russia. But if he starts to look like a loser, then he no longer seems infallible. He's no longer the strongman and arbiter of the system. Although elites are invested in him and his system, there may eventually come a point where people start saying, “maybe somebody else, Vladimir Vladimirovich, maybe somebody else might handle the system better.” It could start with the hardliners trying to push themselves forward.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c3/1b/70d349614e70a8feaae1b8745f8f/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1372538730\"> <br> <p>That's why, again, we see him doubling down. He’s got himself in a corner in the war and in a corner domestically at home. He has made himself the face of this war in Ukraine. His September 30th speech basically said it's his war, his annexation, his Russia. And so, everything will fall on him if it falls apart.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>In the autocratic system that Putin has built, he has to stand for election every so often even though it's mostly window dressing. But it periodically renews his legitimacy. One of those years is 2024. Is he facing a deadline? Does he need to look like he’s won this war by 2024?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>One would think so. In 2024, the reelection has to be in the early part of the year. So, we've got a year and a few months in the Russian political calculations to start to prepare for this and ensure that it all goes smoothly. That was why Putin wanted to get the quick victory in Ukraine well out of the way. Ukraine started in February and March of 2022, because February and March of 2024 will be election time.</p> <p>I'm sure Putin thought he would have been unassailable with a quick, victorious war. Ukraine would be back in the fold and then probably after that, Belarus. Moldova as well, perhaps. There would have been a reframing of the next phase of Putin as the great czar of a reconstituted “Russkiy mir” or “Russian world.”</p> <p>If Putin had succeeded at that, maybe he could have found himself in a position where he could have begun to delegate some power to others.</p> <p>Just this past week, on October 7th, Putin turned 70. He’s in that age when people are asking, does he die in office? There are lots of questions about succession. 2024 is very much an inflection point for the system.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>Do you feel like Ukraine is on course for a military victory and what would that mean to the Russian side?</p> <p><b>Hill:</b> Ukraine has already had a great moral, political and military victory. Russia has not achieved the aims of its special military operation. But I think Putin is obviously hoping that now, with all of the nuclear saber-rattling, threats of nuclear Armageddon, deploying Elon Musk and others to convey his messages, that basically he can take the territory that he's got and get recognition of that. And then he hopes that he will be able to put pressure back on Ukraine. He'd still like to see the Ukrainian political system crumble away. He’d like to get somebody as leader of Ukraine who is personally loyal to him. Putin hopes that he'll still prevail, that he'll find other ways of getting what he wanted when he went across the border in February.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>So to some extent, the biggest thing that Putin wants right now is to get Zelenskyy out. He wants somebody more pliant.</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>That's exactly what he wants. And I'm sure he feels that he might still get that. I mean, everything that he's doing is an effort to discredit Ukraine and Ukrainians and Zelenskyy.</p> <p>Ukraine has the right to choose their own leadership. But Putin will try to manipulate this whichever way he can. He'll keep trying to soften the battlefield beyond Ukraine, keep on trying to poison attitudes internationally against Ukraine.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>Along those lines, what do you make of the fact that some Americans, primarily in the Trump wing of the Republican Party and some Fox News personalities, are expressing doubts about how much support the United States should direct to Ukraine? Is there something about this conflict that you don't think they understand?</p> <p><b>Hill:</b> This goes back to the point I tried to make when I testified at the first impeachment trial against President Trump. There's a direct line between that episode and now. Putin has managed to seed hostile sentiment toward Ukraine. Even if people think they are criticizing Ukraine for their own domestic political purposes, because they want to claim that the Biden administration is giving too much support for Ukraine instead of giving more support to Americans, etc. — they're replaying the targeted messaging that Vladimir Putin has very carefully fed into our political arena. People may think that they're acting independently, but they are echoing the Kremlin's propaganda.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>What do you think is the right response from the West if Putin does detonate some sort of nuclear weapon, either as a demonstration or something else?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>What Putin is trying to do is to get us to talk about the threat of nuclear war instead of what he is doing in Ukraine. He wants the U.S. and Europe to contemplate, as he says, the risks that we faced during the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Euromissile crisis. He wants us to face the prospect of a great superpower war. His solution is to have secret diplomacy, as we did during Cuban Missile Crisis, and have a direct compromise between the United States and Russia.</p> <p>But there's no strategic standoff here. This is pure nuclear blackmail. There can’t be a compromise based on him <i>not </i>setting off a nuclear weapon if we hand over Ukraine. Putin is behaving like a rogue state because, well, he is a rogue state at this point. And he's being explicit about what he wants. We have to pull all the diplomatic stops out. We have to ensure that he's not going to have the effect that he wants with this nuclear brinkmanship.</p> <p>Putin is also making it very clear that to get what you want in the world, you have to have a nuclear weapon and to protect yourself, you also have to have a nuclear weapon. So this is an absolute mess. Global nuclear stability is on a knife edge.</p> <p>But again, this is not about strategic issues. This is not an issue of strategic stability. This is Vladimir Putin pissed off because he hasn't got what he wanted in a war that he started. It's another attempt to adapt to the battlefield.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>Can this war end in a way that would be satisfying for the West and with Putin remaining as Russian leader? Or is this the beginning of a revolution that's going to be very messy and dangerous?</p> <p><b>Hill:</b> It’s unlikely this ends in any satisfying way. You need every side willing to compromise, and Putin doesn't want to compromise his goals.</p> <p>Any compromise is, in any case, always at Ukraine's expense because Putin has taken Ukrainian territory. If we think about World War I, World War II or the settlements in many other conflicts, they always involved some kind territorial disposition that left one side very unhappy.</p> <p>There is not going to be a happy or satisfying ending for anybody, and it's also not going to be happy or satisfying for Vladimir Putin either, honestly.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>It is striking to me that of all the conflicts that Russia has been engaged in since Putin became president, that none of them have been resolved with any kind of a peace settlement. They just have been fought to stalemate.</p> <p><b>Hill:</b> There’s not any good outcome I can see come out of this. What’s incumbent upon us is to figure out is how to constrain Russia’s ability to put Ukraine under pressure again in the future or invade again. If there’s any interim freezing of battle lines, make sure that they're not recognized as official. Maybe we can contemplate some international receivership. We’ve had many of these different formulations in the past for disputed territory. We have to ensure, again, that Ukraine can always defend itself and make it impossible for Putin to break out of constraints and do this again.</p> <p>But that still leaves you with lots of questions about the future relationship with Russia, the future configuration of any European security institutions. How do we reconfigure ourselves internationally to deal with this? The United Nations has proven to be in dire need of an overhaul. The United Nations has been a major player in this conflict. The secretary-general has been heavily involved investigating war crimes and pressing resolutions. But the United Nations has shown itself inadequate because of the configuration of the Security Council and the veto. Everybody's talking about how to address this.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>It occurs to me that there's a kind of reckoning coming for NATO. With Finland joining, that adds a long direct border between NATO and Russia.

Considering the fact that NATO's already getting a line across Europe that it's going to have to defend, should NATO consider membership for Ukraine?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>This is also going to be a big issue, right? There are so many people out there who still look at Ukraine as a proxy war. Many of the people trying to push Ukraine to surrender are basically those who believe that the United States or NATO is somehow using Ukraine in a proxy war with Russia.</p> <p>We're not in a proxy war with Russia, just like we weren’t in a proxy war with Germany during World War I when we were trying to get German forces out of France and Belgium. It wasn’t a proxy war either when we were trying to get Germany out of Poland and all the other places that it invaded in Europe during World War II. We are trying to help Ukraine liberate itself, having been invaded by Russia.</p> <p>This whole proxy war debate deprives Ukraine of agency. But, if we talk about Ukraine being part of NATO at this particular moment, it will simply feed into this flawed discussion. It will detract from the essence of what this war is, which is Russia trying to seize Ukrainian territory.</p> <p>Russia believes NATO is simply a cover for the United States in Europe. I think it should be very clear right now with Finland and Sweden wanting to join that this is not the case at all. Finland and Sweden did not apply to NATO before, they have now because NATO is focused on ensuring common collective security and defense, and Russia has put all of Europe at risk.</p> <p>I see current NATO expansion as a kind of an interim step, a way station to thinking more broadly about how we configure ourselves after Ukraine.</p> <p>You know, there's also talk about making Ukraine a “giant Israel,” making Ukraine completely self-sufficient for its own security, as, frankly, Finland was before. I think we have to have an open discussion about all of this and not be fixated on one aspect or another.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>In other words, even if Ukraine wins the war for its territory, even if Putin is somehow constrained or deposed, we're still at the very beginning of a rethinking of the international order that those outcomes are not going to solve.</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>Yes. We’ve also had the impacts of Covid. We've got a climate crisis, which should be evident to everybody by now. There are so many things that we need to contend with, and we've only got the skeleton of an international system.</p> <p>Putin is holding the whole world hostage. We've got so many things that we have to deal with. I understand why the Global South is so frustrated with all of this: “While you're fighting this war in Ukraine over the same kind of territorial disputes you guys have been having for a hundred years now, we're dying here from disease and climate change. Our countries have flooded. We're starving and you guys are expecting us to help you solve this?” The United Nations system is breaking down, as [António] Guterres, the secretary-general, has said over and over again. All the alarm bells are going off. And Vladimir Putin is behaving as if it's the 1780s all over again.</p> <p><b>Reynolds: </b>So we need a new or a revamped global order to address the whole problem?</p> <p><b>Hill: </b>That’s obvious. So how do we do it? A lot of people don't find the idea of a revamped United Nations very popular. I can just imagine some of my former colleagues groaning loudly. We definitely need a slimmed-down version.</p> <p>But we do need international institutions to deal with the magnitude of the problems that we're facing. It’s ironic that Elon Musk, the man who has been talking about getting us to Mars should be Putin’s messenger for the war in Ukraine, when we're having a really hard time getting our act together on this planet. But it's glaringly obvious to ordinary people that we need to do so. Time is not on our side.<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"It’s been nearly eight months since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops and tanks over the border into Ukraine, and a lot has changed in that time. Ukraine has shown itself to be a far more robust military force than pretty much anyone predicted. Talk has changed from wondering how long Ukraine could hold out to how much territory it can retake — and to when and how the war will end.\n But it’s still hard to imagine how Putin’s war on Ukraine will conclude. Does Putin even have an endgame? If he really wants to control Ukrainian territory, why does he seem so bent on destroying it?\n To get insights into these questions, I reached out to Fiona Hill, one of America’s most clear-eyed observers of Russia and Putin, who served as an adviser to former President Donald Trump and gained fame for her testimony in his first impeachment trial. In the early days of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Hill warned in an interview with POLITICO that what Putin was trying to do was not only seize Ukraine but destroy the current world order. And she recognized from the start that Putin would use the threat of nuclear conflict to try to get his way.\n Now, despite the setbacks Russia has suffered on the battlefield, Hill thinks Putin is undaunted. She sees him adapting to new conditions, not giving up. And she sees him trying to get the West to accede to his aims by using messengers like billionaire Elon Musk to propose arrangements that would end the conflict on his terms.\n “Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they're just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin,” Hill says.\n But while Putin appears to be doubling down in Ukraine, the conflict poses some real dangers to his leadership. He has identified himself quite directly with the war, Hill notes, and he can’t afford to look like a loser. If he begins to lose support from Russian elites, his hold on power could slip.\n The West has come a long way since February in understanding the stakes in Ukraine, Hill says, but the world still hasn’t totally grasped the full challenge Putin is posing. Putin must be contained, Hill says, but that won’t happen unless and until international institutions established in the wake of World War II evolve so they can contain him. And that conversation is only just beginning.\n “This is a great power conflict, the third great power conflict in the European space in a little over a century,” Hill says. “It's the end of the existing world order. Our world is not going to be the same as it was before.”\n This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. \n Reynolds: The war clearly hasn't gone as Putin originally intended. How has Putin reacted to his setbacks and how do you think his mindset is evolving?\n Hill: Whenever he has a setback, Putin figures he can get out of it, that he can turn things around. That’s partly because of his training as a KGB operative. In the past, when asked about the success of operations, he’s pooh-poohed the idea that operations always go as planned, that everything is always perfect. He says there are always problems in an operation, there are always setbacks. Sometimes they’re absolute disasters. The key is adaptation.\n Another hallmark of Putin is that he doubles down. He always takes the more extreme step in his range of options, the one that actually cuts off other alternatives. Putin has often related an experience he had as a kid, when he trapped a rat in a corner in the apartment building he lived in, in Leningrad, and the rat shocked him by jumping out and fighting back. He tells this story as if it's a story about himself, that if he's ever cornered, he will always fight back.\n But he's also the person who puts himself in the corner. We know that the Russians have had very high casualties and that they've been running out of manpower and equipment in Ukraine. The casualty rate on the Russian side keeps mounting. A few months ago, estimates were 50,000. Now the suggestions are 90,000 killed or severely injured. This is a real blow given the 170,000 Russia troops deployed to the Ukrainian border when the invasion began.\n So, what does Putin do? He sends even more troops in by launching a full-on mobilization. He still hasn't said this is a war. It remains a “special military operation,” but he calls up 300,000 people. Then, he goes several steps further and announces the annexation of the territories that Russia has been fighting over for the last several months, not just Donetsk and Luhansk, but also the territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n Putin gives himself no way out except to pursue the original goals he had when he went in, which is the dismemberment of Ukraine and Russia annexing its territory. And he's still trying to adapt his responses to setbacks on the battlefield.\n \n  \n Reynolds: At this point, if he's so adaptive, do you think he has an endgame?\n Hill: In his mind, I think Putin still thinks he's got more game to play. His endgame is to go out of this war on his terms. What we're seeing right now, with the annexations and the big speech that he made on September 30th is very clear. He sees this conflict as a full-on war with the West, and he still is adamant on removing Ukraine from the map and from global affairs.\n It's also clear that he has no intention whatsoever of giving up Donetsk and Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as Crimea, which he's already taken and already declared as part of Russia for time immemorial.\n Reynolds: Why does Putin want all that territory? Does he want the symbolism of having restored an important part of the Russian Empire, reestablishing this mythological Novorossiya, taking back lands that Russia seized from the Ottoman Empire? Or does he really want to rule this part of modern-day Ukraine in concrete, practical ways?\n Hill: It's actually both of those things. They are inextricably linked. You mentioned this idea of Novorossiya, “New Russia.” I think most people have forgotten that he used this term in 2014. Back then, the Kremlin triggered the war in Donbas as part of an effort to regain control of the territories of Novorossiya that were first annexed from the Ottoman Empire by Catherine the Great back in the late 18th century.\n There wasn't really a lot of settlement there then, and that’s how we got Potemkin villages — Prince Grigory Potemkin took Catherine on a carriage ride through her new dominion and they created fake villages, with peasants brought in to wave at the empress as she went by.\n We have this same issue now — what and who is Putin presiding over? Even Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, recently admitted that Russia hasn’t quite worked out the borders of the annexed areas yet, because the Ukrainians have been pushing back. The question of what Russia actually controls beyond all the symbolism of annexation is still a major question.\n Reynolds: If Putin wants Ukrainian territory so badly, why is he raining down such destruction on civilian areas and committing so many human rights abuses in occupied areas?\n Hill: This is punishment, but also perverse redevelopment. You cow people into submission, destroy what they had and all their links to their past and their old lives, and then make them into something new and, thus, yours. Destroy Ukraine and Ukrainians. Build New Russia and create Russians. Its brutal but also a hallmark of imperial conquest.\n Reynolds: And it’s how they did it in the 18th century.\n Hill: Exactly. Putin would love to control the territory. But control involves actually having people on your side. And that is really a big question. We've seen in all of these territories, Russia shipping people out or detaining them, from entire families and children to teachers, administrators and local police, and then proxy citizens sent in from Russia itself.\n Putin's initial goal when he launched the invasion was the collapse of central Ukrainian authority, the imposition of a puppet government in Kyiv, and all local governments swearing allegiance to Moscow, probably with some political commissar-type proxy leaders put in place around the country — the kind of thing that we saw happening in 2014 in the Russian-occupied territories of Donetsk and Lugansk and Crimea. But of course, that didn't happen. So the problem that Putin has is controlling people in these territories rather than playing his own version of Potemkin villages.\n Reynolds: We've recently had Elon Musk step into this conflict trying to promote discussion of peace settlements. What do you make of the role that he's playing?\n Hill: It's very clear that Elon Musk is transmitting a message for Putin. There was a conference in Aspen in late September when Musk offered a version of what was in his tweet — including the recognition of Crimea as Russian because it’s been mostly Russian since the 1780s — and the suggestion that the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia should be up for negotiation, because there should be guaranteed water supplies to Crimea. He made this suggestion before Putin’s annexation of those two territories on September 30. It was a very specific reference. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia essentially control all the water supplies to Crimea. Crimea is a dry peninsula. It has aquifers, but it doesn't have rivers. It’s dependent on water from the Dnipro River that flows through a canal from Kherson. It’s unlikely Elon Musk knows about this himself. The reference to water is so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin.\n Now, there are several reasons why Musk’s intervention is interesting and significant. First of all, Putin does this frequently. He uses prominent people as intermediaries to feel out the general political environment, to basically test how people are going to react to ideas. Henry Kissinger, for example, has had interactions with Putin directly and relayed messages. Putin often uses various trusted intermediaries including all kinds of businesspeople. I had intermediaries sent to discuss things with me while I was in government.\n This is a classic Putin play. It's just fascinating, of course, that it's Elon Musk in this instance, because obviously Elon Musk has a huge Twitter following. He's got a longstanding reputation in Russia through Tesla, the SpaceX space programs and also through Starlink. He's one of the most popular men in opinion polls in Russia. At the same time, he's played a very important part in supporting Ukraine by providing Starlink internet systems to Ukraine, and kept telecommunications going in Ukraine, paid for in part by the U.S. government. Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they're just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.\n Reynolds: Putin is very comfortable dealing with billionaires and oligarchs. That's a world that he knows well. But by using Musk this way, he goes right over the heads of [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government.\n Hill: He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process. He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.\n \n  \n Reynolds: You have compared Putin's invasion of Ukraine to Hitler's invasions of other countries in World War II, of Czechoslovakia, of Poland. Do you still see it that way? Do you think that Putin has become Hitler-like in how he thinks of himself and how he seeks territory?\n Hill: Yes, but also like Kaiser Wilhelm in World War I as well. Look, exactly 100 years before Putin annexed Crimea in 2014, in 1914, the Germans invaded Belgium and France and World War I was fought as a Great Power conflict to eject Germany from Belgium and France. And World War II in Europe, of course, was a refighting territorially of many of the outcomes of World War I.\n Part of the problem is that conceptually, people have a hard time with the idea of a world war. It brings all kinds of horrors to mind — the Holocaust and the detonation of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the dawning of the nuclear age. But if you think about it, a world war is a great power conflict over territory which overturns the existing international order and where other states find themselves on different sides of the conflict. It involves economic warfare, information warfare, as well as kinetic war.\n We're in the same situation. Again, Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, exactly 100 years after Germany invaded Belgium and France — and just in the same way that Hitler seized the Sudetenland, annexed Austria and invaded Poland. We're having a hard time coming to terms with what we're dealing with here. This is a great power conflict, the third great power conflict in the European space in a little over a century. It's the end of the existing world order. Our world is not going to be the same as it was before.\n People worry about this being dangerous hyperbole. But we have to really accept what the situation is to be able to respond appropriately. Each war has been fought differently. Modern wars involve information space and cyberspace, and we've seen all of these at play here. And, in the 21st century, these are economic and financial wars. We're all-in on the financial and economic side of things.\n Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned global energy and food security on its head because of the way Russia is leveraging gas and oil and the blockade Putin has imposed in the Black Sea against Ukrainian grain exports. Russia has not just targeted Ukrainian agricultural production, as well as port facilities for exporting grain, but caused a global food crisis. These are global effects of what is very clearly not just a regional war.\n Keep in mind that Putin himself has used the language of both world wars. He's talked about the fact that Ukraine did not exist as a state until after World War I, after the dissolution of the Russian Empire and the creation of the Soviet Union. He has blamed the early Soviets for the formation of what he calls an artificial state. Right from the very beginning, Putin himself has said that he is refighting World War II. So, the hyperbole has come from Vladimir Putin, who has said that he's reversing all of the outcomes territorially from World War I and also, in effect, World War II and the Cold War. He's not accepting the territorial configuration of Europe as it currently is.\n What we have to figure out now is, how are we going to contend with this?\n Reynolds: China and India, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders who have not exactly been with West on this — how do you think their views of what Russia is doing is changing?\n Hill: This is another global dimension. Just before the invasion, at the Beijing Olympics, we had Xi Jinping and Putin standing in seeming solidarity, talking about a limitless partnership, and Xi Jinping being very explicit in terms of Chinese opposition to the expansion of NATO and the role of NATO in the world. Clearly, at that point, Xi and China didn't expect that Vladimir Putin's special military operation would turn into the largest military action in Europe since World War II. Now, Xi Jinping is leery about showing any kind of diminution of his support for Vladimir Putin and Russia, since that would suggest he made a major miscalculation in lending Putin support. We haven't seen Xi repudiating Putin and Russia directly. But we've certainly seen some signs of concern. At a meeting in Central Asia around the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Putin himself acknowledged that China had concerns. We're pretty sure at this point that the Chinese also don't like Vladimir Putin's nuclear saber rattling in the context of the war in Ukraine, because that destabilizes the larger strategic balance globally, not just in Europe.\n For India, this has been a nightmare, frankly, and they've been trying to straddle the fence and figure out a balance. They don’t want to get on the wrong side of the United States or Ukraine, or Russia, and they just don't really know quite what to do. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Modi has said explicitly to Putin, look, this is a time for peace, not war. And being much more outspoken on the issue of the conflict than perhaps some might have anticipated. That's not insignificant.\n Once we get past the party Congress in China, we should watch how the Chinese-Russian relationship plays out. China would be instrumental in signaling to Putin how far he can go in terms of pursuing his endgame.\n Reynolds: Let's talk about the situation inside Russia. Do you think Putin was surprised by the wave of protests that followed his announcement of what he called a partial mobilization? Or was he expecting that?\n Hill: Yes, he was expecting pushback which is why he called it partial when it’s really a stealth full mobilization. The goal is to try to get the military up to full strength and get everybody he possibly can. The problem is that all these new forces are not battle ready. Many have had minimal military training. It’s very clear that most of them are going to be used as cannon fodder.\n Putin’s responding not just to the setbacks on the battlefield, but to setbacks in the information war in the domestic arena. He's getting pushback from the party of war. We have to remember there were nationalists since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s who wanted to retake Ukraine, not just Crimea, and reabsorb all the Russian-speaking territories. People in the cohort around Putin have pushed the invasion of Ukraine for some considerable period of time, and he has to keep them on his side. They are not satisfied. They want Ukraine dismembered.\n The shock, perhaps, is how many Russians have fled the mobilization. Although Russian authorities have been going to the borders to forcibly conscript people lining up to leave, they still haven’t taken the step of closing all the borders off. Putin and the Kremlin are aware that they would get a massive backlash if they did. We’ve already seen violence in Dagestan and other places where ethnic minorities have borne the brunt of recruitment. I think they are very, very aware that they've got to leave a safety valve open because otherwise there might be more protests, and more violence in response to the mobilization.\n Reynolds: If there are more protests and more violence, does that pose a threat to Putin as leader? How weak or vulnerable is Putin's position right now?\n Hill: Back to the Soviet period, there were tens of thousands of violent protests across the Soviet Union over the years. This didn’t lead to the disintegration of the Soviet Union because of severe repression. It was something messy they had to deal with. They decapitated the opposition, and that's what Putin's done. Russia is back to the USSR. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in isolation in a penal colony. The repressive capacity of the government is pretty significant. They’ve been taking thousands of people off the streets and putting them in jail. I think Putin feels he can decapitate any organized opposition. He has to just be careful to control the sheer number of opposition protests, which is, again, why they're keeping the safety valves open.\n Putin knows Russian history. World War I did lead to mass protests. The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War earlier in the 1900s also led to mass protests that got out of hand and discredited the czarist system. All of this could discredit him. So, there is some real risk. What he's making sure of is that there's no one who could lead these protests and make them coalesce.\n If you think back to when Navalny was poisoned in 2020, he was out in the Urals region and Siberia, pulling together opposition groups at a time when there were many protests going on in Russia. He was poisoned because he was getting some traction.\n Nonetheless, the mobilization chips away at Putin’s popularity because people feel that they've got no hope. They're no longer able to watch the war on their TV screens and switch it off and forget it's happening. They're forced to confront it. Support for the war was already fairly passive, but active support for the war is declining and support for Putin himself will decline as well. And he's got to keep placating the hardliners. So, he's got to take extreme actions.\n You're going to start hearing more and more stories of people who've gone to the front completely unprepared and got killed. That will reduce tolerance for the special military operation. If that happens, it could impact Putin's standing among the elite. He's been pretty much unassailable as long as he's been the only really truly popular politician in Russia. But if he starts to look like a loser, then he no longer seems infallible. He's no longer the strongman and arbiter of the system. Although elites are invested in him and his system, there may eventually come a point where people start saying, “maybe somebody else, Vladimir Vladimirovich, maybe somebody else might handle the system better.” It could start with the hardliners trying to push themselves forward.\n \n  \n That's why, again, we see him doubling down. He’s got himself in a corner in the war and in a corner domestically at home. He has made himself the face of this war in Ukraine. His September 30th speech basically said it's his war, his annexation, his Russia. And so, everything will fall on him if it falls apart.\n Reynolds: In the autocratic system that Putin has built, he has to stand for election every so often even though it's mostly window dressing. But it periodically renews his legitimacy. One of those years is 2024. Is he facing a deadline? Does he need to look like he’s won this war by 2024?\n Hill: One would think so. In 2024, the reelection has to be in the early part of the year. So, we've got a year and a few months in the Russian political calculations to start to prepare for this and ensure that it all goes smoothly. That was why Putin wanted to get the quick victory in Ukraine well out of the way. Ukraine started in February and March of 2022, because February and March of 2024 will be election time.\n I'm sure Putin thought he would have been unassailable with a quick, victorious war. Ukraine would be back in the fold and then probably after that, Belarus. Moldova as well, perhaps. There would have been a reframing of the next phase of Putin as the great czar of a reconstituted “Russkiy mir” or “Russian world.”\n If Putin had succeeded at that, maybe he could have found himself in a position where he could have begun to delegate some power to others.\n Just this past week, on October 7th, Putin turned 70. He’s in that age when people are asking, does he die in office? There are lots of questions about succession. 2024 is very much an inflection point for the system.\n Reynolds: Do you feel like Ukraine is on course for a military victory and what would that mean to the Russian side?\n Hill: Ukraine has already had a great moral, political and military victory. Russia has not achieved the aims of its special military operation. But I think Putin is obviously hoping that now, with all of the nuclear saber-rattling, threats of nuclear Armageddon, deploying Elon Musk and others to convey his messages, that basically he can take the territory that he's got and get recognition of that. And then he hopes that he will be able to put pressure back on Ukraine. He'd still like to see the Ukrainian political system crumble away. He’d like to get somebody as leader of Ukraine who is personally loyal to him. Putin hopes that he'll still prevail, that he'll find other ways of getting what he wanted when he went across the border in February.\n Reynolds: So to some extent, the biggest thing that Putin wants right now is to get Zelenskyy out. He wants somebody more pliant.\n Hill: That's exactly what he wants. And I'm sure he feels that he might still get that. I mean, everything that he's doing is an effort to discredit Ukraine and Ukrainians and Zelenskyy.\n Ukraine has the right to choose their own leadership. But Putin will try to manipulate this whichever way he can. He'll keep trying to soften the battlefield beyond Ukraine, keep on trying to poison attitudes internationally against Ukraine.\n Reynolds: Along those lines, what do you make of the fact that some Americans, primarily in the Trump wing of the Republican Party and some Fox News personalities, are expressing doubts about how much support the United States should direct to Ukraine? Is there something about this conflict that you don't think they understand?\n Hill: This goes back to the point I tried to make when I testified at the first impeachment trial against President Trump. There's a direct line between that episode and now. Putin has managed to seed hostile sentiment toward Ukraine. Even if people think they are criticizing Ukraine for their own domestic political purposes, because they want to claim that the Biden administration is giving too much support for Ukraine instead of giving more support to Americans, etc. — they're replaying the targeted messaging that Vladimir Putin has very carefully fed into our political arena. People may think that they're acting independently, but they are echoing the Kremlin's propaganda.\n Reynolds: What do you think is the right response from the West if Putin does detonate some sort of nuclear weapon, either as a demonstration or something else?\n Hill: What Putin is trying to do is to get us to talk about the threat of nuclear war instead of what he is doing in Ukraine. He wants the U.S. and Europe to contemplate, as he says, the risks that we faced during the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Euromissile crisis. He wants us to face the prospect of a great superpower war. His solution is to have secret diplomacy, as we did during Cuban Missile Crisis, and have a direct compromise between the United States and Russia.\n But there's no strategic standoff here. This is pure nuclear blackmail. There can’t be a compromise based on him not setting off a nuclear weapon if we hand over Ukraine. Putin is behaving like a rogue state because, well, he is a rogue state at this point. And he's being explicit about what he wants. We have to pull all the diplomatic stops out. We have to ensure that he's not going to have the effect that he wants with this nuclear brinkmanship.\n Putin is also making it very clear that to get what you want in the world, you have to have a nuclear weapon and to protect yourself, you also have to have a nuclear weapon. So this is an absolute mess. Global nuclear stability is on a knife edge.\n But again, this is not about strategic issues. This is not an issue of strategic stability. This is Vladimir Putin pissed off because he hasn't got what he wanted in a war that he started. It's another attempt to adapt to the battlefield.\n Reynolds: Can this war end in a way that would be satisfying for the West and with Putin remaining as Russian leader? Or is this the beginning of a revolution that's going to be very messy and dangerous?\n Hill: It’s unlikely this ends in any satisfying way. You need every side willing to compromise, and Putin doesn't want to compromise his goals.\n Any compromise is, in any case, always at Ukraine's expense because Putin has taken Ukrainian territory. If we think about World War I, World War II or the settlements in many other conflicts, they always involved some kind territorial disposition that left one side very unhappy.\n There is not going to be a happy or satisfying ending for anybody, and it's also not going to be happy or satisfying for Vladimir Putin either, honestly.\n Reynolds: It is striking to me that of all the conflicts that Russia has been engaged in since Putin became president, that none of them have been resolved with any kind of a peace settlement. They just have been fought to stalemate.\n Hill: There’s not any good outcome I can see come out of this. What’s incumbent upon us is to figure out is how to constrain Russia’s ability to put Ukraine under pressure again in the future or invade again. If there’s any interim freezing of battle lines, make sure that they're not recognized as official. Maybe we can contemplate some international receivership. We’ve had many of these different formulations in the past for disputed territory. We have to ensure, again, that Ukraine can always defend itself and make it impossible for Putin to break out of constraints and do this again.\n But that still leaves you with lots of questions about the future relationship with Russia, the future configuration of any European security institutions. How do we reconfigure ourselves internationally to deal with this? The United Nations has proven to be in dire need of an overhaul. The United Nations has been a major player in this conflict. The secretary-general has been heavily involved investigating war crimes and pressing resolutions. But the United Nations has shown itself inadequate because of the configuration of the Security Council and the veto. Everybody's talking about how to address this.\n Reynolds: It occurs to me that there's a kind of reckoning coming for NATO. With Finland joining, that adds a long direct border between NATO and Russia. With the new union between Belarus and Russia, there's going to be another NATO border between Poland and Belarus. Considering the fact that NATO's already getting a line across Europe that it's going to have to defend, should NATO consider membership for Ukraine?\n Hill: This is also going to be a big issue, right? There are so many people out there who still look at Ukraine as a proxy war. Many of the people trying to push Ukraine to surrender are basically those who believe that the United States or NATO is somehow using Ukraine in a proxy war with Russia.\n We're not in a proxy war with Russia, just like we weren’t in a proxy war with Germany during World War I when we were trying to get German forces out of France and Belgium. It wasn’t a proxy war either when we were trying to get Germany out of Poland and all the other places that it invaded in Europe during World War II. We are trying to help Ukraine liberate itself, having been invaded by Russia.\n This whole proxy war debate deprives Ukraine of agency. But, if we talk about Ukraine being part of NATO at this particular moment, it will simply feed into this flawed discussion. It will detract from the essence of what this war is, which is Russia trying to seize Ukrainian territory.\n Russia believes NATO is simply a cover for the United States in Europe. I think it should be very clear right now with Finland and Sweden wanting to join that this is not the case at all. Finland and Sweden did not apply to NATO before, they have now because NATO is focused on ensuring common collective security and defense, and Russia has put all of Europe at risk.\n I see current NATO expansion as a kind of an interim step, a way station to thinking more broadly about how we configure ourselves after Ukraine.\n You know, there's also talk about making Ukraine a “giant Israel,” making Ukraine completely self-sufficient for its own security, as, frankly, Finland was before. I think we have to have an open discussion about all of this and not be fixated on one aspect or another.\n Reynolds: In other words, even if Ukraine wins the war for its territory, even if Putin is somehow constrained or deposed, we're still at the very beginning of a rethinking of the international order that those outcomes are not going to solve.\n Hill: Yes. We’ve also had the impacts of Covid. We've got a climate crisis, which should be evident to everybody by now. There are so many things that we need to contend with, and we've only got the skeleton of an international system.\n Putin is holding the whole world hostage. We've got so many things that we have to deal with. I understand why the Global South is so frustrated with all of this: “While you're fighting this war in Ukraine over the same kind of territorial disputes you guys have been having for a hundred years now, we're dying here from disease and climate change. Our countries have flooded. We're starving and you guys are expecting us to help you solve this?” The United Nations system is breaking down, as [António] Guterres, the secretary-general, has said over and over again. All the alarm bells are going off. And Vladimir Putin is behaving as if it's the 1780s all over again.\n Reynolds: So we need a new or a revamped global order to address the whole problem?\n Hill: That’s obvious. So how do we do it? A lot of people don't find the idea of a revamped United Nations very popular. I can just imagine some of my former colleagues groaning loudly. We definitely need a slimmed-down version.\n But we do need international institutions to deal with the magnitude of the problems that we're facing. It’s ironic that Elon Musk, the man who has been talking about getting us to Mars should be Putin’s messenger for the war in Ukraine, when we're having a really hard time getting our act together on this planet. But it's glaringly obvious to ordinary people that we need to do so. Time is not on our side.","dc:creator":"Maura

It was late June of 2019 and aides to the speaker of the House had just sent an emergency summons to the top lawyers on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, beckoning them to meet the California Democrat at the House’s Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, known as the “SCIF.” Given the classified documents she was about to read, the aides knew Pelosi would want answers fast.</p> <p>A few days prior, Former President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr had handed over a trove of previously undisclosed portions of the Mueller Report that he had initially refused to show Congress. Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) had been itching to get his hands on the files for weeks, and now Pelosi knew why.</p> <p>As Pelosi pored over the redacted pages of Mueller’s report, she froze on a passage from the unpublicized section. In his own words, Mueller questioned the honesty of Trump’s written testimony to prosecutors when he said “he did not recall ‘the specifics of any call’” he had had with his friend Roger Stone regarding Russia’s hack of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. That claim clashed with other witnesses, Mueller wrote, who testified that Trump <i>did</i> discuss the act of political sabotage with Stone and others. Trump — Mueller was indicating — had perjured himself. In fact, Mueller suggested that Trump may have also encouraged his allies to conveniently forget those conversations when they spoke to investigators, hinting that those who helped cover up unsavory details would be rewarded.</p> <p>As Pelosi looked up from the pages, a combination of disbelief and devastation on her face. She caught the gaze of Judiciary Committee counsel Aaron Hiller, who eagerly awaited her reaction.</p> <p>“Aaron,” Pelosi said, “do you think this is impeachable?”</p> <p>The question was far from a random one. Since the previous month, Nadler and a group of progressives on the House Judiciary Committee had tried to push Pelosi to launch an effort to oust Trump. They’d secretly started a whipping campaign, buttonholing their Democratic colleagues to publicly endorse an “impeachment inquiry.” The effort had created a media furor, as reporters began counting the rising number of House Democrats who supported the probe.</p> <p>The Judiciary rebels’ tactics had been aimed at one person: Pelosi herself. The speaker, they knew, was an impeachment skeptic who viewed such an effort as a political boomerang that once launched could not be controlled. She feared that by going after Trump, she would jeopardize her own hard-won majority — and could even hand Trump a second term. It was why, after Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) had been caught on camera brashly vowing to “impeach the motherfucker” on the first day of the new Congress, Pelosi worked to tamp down the sentiment fast. It was why she had told a reporter that “he’s not worth it” in March of that year — as in, not worth impeaching. And it was why, after the Mueller Report came out suggesting Trump obstructed justice as many as 10 times, Pelosi had strongly rebuffed arguments — including from her own Judiciary chairman — that the evidence in the mammoth 448-page report was grounds for removal.</p> <p>But in the basement of the Capitol that day, Pelosi saw just how far Trump may have gone in trying to hamstring Mueller’s work. Lying to a federal prosecutor was a federal offense. So was obstructing a federal investigation.</p> <p>The assembled panel lawyers all began talking at once when Pelosi asked the Judiciary aide whether such evidence was enough to indict<b> </b>the president. The speaker silenced them with a flick of her palm. Turning back to Hiller, she repeated her question: “Aaron, do you think this is an impeachable offense?”</p> <p>The room went silent as everyone turned to the counsel, who didn’t hesitate.</p> <p>“Yes, ma’am,” Hiller answered. “I do.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6c/41/720cc8ce421b8ba1fc9214d91b98/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>If Pelosi agreed, she did not say. But the knowledge that Trump may have tried to obstruct justice so blatantly — actions that almost certainly would have led to criminal charges against any other American — did not make her change course. Emerging from that basement room, she worked as hard as ever that summer to quell the rising tide of impeachment. She told her aides during one July staff meeting that “I don’t care if they’re all for it!”— meaning she wouldn’t support impeachment even if she was the last holdout in her caucus. In the end, of course, she would preside over not one but two impeachments, and both would fail to oust Trump.</p> <p>As Pelosi gears up for her expected retirement should Republicans retake the House in November, historians and pundits are sure to reflect on the vast legacy of the country’s first female speaker. The one-time housewife from California will be rightly celebrated for the trail she blazed through representative politics, earning renown as one of the Democratic Party’s most formidable fundraisers, strategists and dealmakers. That former President Barack Obama’s eponymous health care law is providing coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans today is a credit to Pelosi’s careful, steel-spined stewardship. And she has helped deliver major legislative victories for President Joe Biden, shepherding passage of an expansive social safety net, a once-in-a-generation infrastructure investment and massive Covid-19 relief.</p> <p><br>But her legacy will also be defined by the ways she managed her party’s impeachment efforts and for the long-term corrosive effects of those failed efforts on the nation’s political landscape as well as the Congress’ capacity to wield its massive oversight powers fairly and effectively. There’s a widespread but inaccurate belief that the two impeachments were doomed to failure, that no matter what facts emerged Democrats would never be able to overcome Republican fealty to Trump. But this downplays the important role Pelosi played in crafting the Democrats’ strategy.</p> <p><br>In our new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unchecked-Rachael-Bade/dp/0063040794\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666033386944,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf0a-d5ef-ad97-bf7f0c940006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666033386944,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf0a-d5ef-ad97-bf7f0c940006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unchecked-Rachael-Bade/dp/0063040794&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-e753-d231-abc3-f7f3f0f30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Unchecked: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump</i>&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-e753-d231-abc3-f7f3f0f30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>Unchecked: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump</i></a><i>,</i> we draw on more than 250 interviews<b> </b>to reveal how Pelosi viewed impeachment — and aggressive oversight of Trump — as problematic for her majority and for Democrats politically. How,<b> </b>despite other Democrats fighting for her to do more, Pelosi worked behind the scenes to slow efforts to hold Trump accountable. We show how the speaker accustomed to steering her fractious caucus with an iron grip, lost control to a band of liberal Democrats, who whipped together an effective mutiny of members after Trump tried to leverage taxpayer dollars in Ukraine to secure his own reelection. The book details how Pelosi, in a bid to wrest back her authority, did an about-face, ultimately embracing impeachment — but only half-heartedly. Even Democrats privately say Pelosi undercut her own impeachment inquiry by prioritizing politics over fact-finding. In her eagerness to get impeachment done by Christmas so her frontliners could pivot to talking about legislation she viewed as necessary to protect Democrats’ majority, she put the probe on an artificially accelerated timeline that doomed it to failure before Democrats had made their strongest case against Trump to the nation. That meant sidelining investigative threads that could have exposed a fuller and more complete picture of Trump’s misdeeds.</p> <p><br>“It’s not the House’s job to self-censor and be timid; it’s the House’s job to build the most compelling case for impeachment,” said Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at University of Texas School of Law. “The House limited itself in ways that made it very easy for even potentially gettable senators to turn around and say, ‘Well you didn’t do this; we’re not going to do it for you.’”</p> <p>The book makes clear the cost of her strategy — support from persuadable Republicans and the general public. Pelosi’s efforts to constrain Nadler ended up exposing Trump’s first impeachment to accusations of procedural impropriety and “unconstitutionality” — even from other Democrats — leading moderate Republicans privately concerned about Trump’s misdeeds to nonetheless fall in line with their party. It describes in detail how Pelosi shrugged off the advice of a sympathetic Republican who implored her to take more time to create a record of first-hand witnesses against Trump, even offering to impeach if she’d fight in the courts for such testimony.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/15/fb1ea0c54ddfa29c85eb84dd5069/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>Even after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, an impeachment-wary Pelosi wasn't immediately sold on a second effort to oust him. Fearing impeachment could upend Biden’s agenda, she stifled an effort to impeach Trump that very night and queried her allies whether a second attempt at removal was necessary at all. (Pelosi and her office initially cooperated with our book. But upon learning about some of the revelations we’d gathered from sources close to her — revelations not sanctioned to be released publicly — the speaker’s office cut us off and chided lawmakers and House Democratic aides for revealing too much.

Hill Republicans, our book shows, privately worried about the president’s norm-shattering behavior — yet abandoned their scruples to protect him out of fear and political opportunism. They also engaged in obstructionist tactics that played a significant role in unleashing Trump to more grave acts of recklessness, putting the party ahead of the country by turning a blind eye to his behavior.</p> <p>But decisions that the speaker made out of political caution and calculation also boosted Trump’s chances at a comeback, leaving the 45th president room for a possible return to the West Wing. The ultimate result, however, was more than two acquittals of Trump. Pelosi’s failed effort, some experts believe, exposed the devastating limits of impeachment, Congress’ most powerful tool for holding a president to account. Trump’s moves to run roughshod over congressional subpoenas and investigations — and Democrats’ acquiescence under the speaker — created a standard of unhindered executive power for future leaders to emulate and exploit.</p> <p>“Speaker Pelosi’s preference for a quick impeachment that would not drag down Democratic chances in the 2020 election made it impossible to do the sustain rear-guard action necessary to shore up impeachment in the face of the Trump onslaught,” said presidential historian, impeachment expert and New York University professor Timothy Naftali.</p> <p>“There was conventional wisdom in Washington that there was no way of getting Republican support and therefore it was not really worth making the effort. That was a mistake…Even if you weren’t going to turn a single [Republican], the effort was constitutionally necessary for the public.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/41/b6/a2c31bfd405298f117681ad37ce6/section-breaks-template.png\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Impeachment skeptic</h3> <p><b>Nancy Pelosi never liked</b> impeachment.</p> <p>In 1998, she had witnessed how then-Speaker Newt Gingrich’s attempt to impeach then-President Bill Clinton had backfired. Instead of ousting Clinton for lying under oath about having received oral sex in the West Wing, the Senate rejected the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice — and in the process, Gingrich’s party had rejected him. Gingrich ended up resigning as speaker after the GOP lost House seats in what became the poorest midterm election performance by a party that didn’t control the White House in 60 years. And Clinton ended up enjoying a political lift, as his approval ratings climbed to a post-impeachment 73 percent.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/86/53ebcdcd4f109a1de00c628f3e15/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>During her first turn as speaker<b> </b>in 2007, Pelosi had easily put down calls from her party’s left flank to impeach then-President George W. Bush over the Iraq War. Even after picketers surrounded her home and slept in her driveway, Pelosi insisted her caucus stay focused on legislating — and she had been rewarded for it: Two years later, Democrats swept the 2008 elections to seize the White House and expand their majorities in Congress.</p> <p>On the night her party flipped the House in 2018, in a PBS NewsHour interview just hours after the first polls closed, Pelosi tried to head off the talk that was already swirling about ousting Trump. “For those who want impeachment, that’s not what our caucus is about,” Pelosi said. “That is not unifying, and I get criticized in my own party for not being more in support of that. But… if [impeachment] would happen, it would have to be bipartisan and the evidence would have to be so conclusive.”</p> <p>But Pelosi couldn’t deter the members of her caucus who were determined to find that conclusive proof. She<b> </b>had to contend with people like Nadler and his Judiciary renegades. That spring, as unenforced House subpoenas piled up due to Trump’s stonewalling, Nadler blessed his members to confront Pelosi about impeachment. Pelosi had balked during the huddle. And immediately after, had summoned Nadler to her office for late-night grilling.</p> <p>“I’m not saying ‘Let’s draw up impeachment articles,’ but we shouldn’t be afraid of saying the word,” Nadler told Pelosi that night, defending himself. “We are engaged in mortal combat across the board to get even bare-bones information from the Justice Department. How do you think we’re going to get these people in [to testify] if we don’t say the word ‘impeachment’?”</p> <p>Pelosi bristled.</p> <p>“The Democratic caucus doesn’t support the idea, let alone the American public,” she shot back. “We’re in the majority because of about two dozen members, and all of the evidence we have in front of us shows that those people will be taking a profound risk if they talk about impeachment — if <i>you </i>talk about impeachment.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/eb/fd/3d69ebd44ef692bf48f08c974a99/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary4.jpg\"> <br> <p>She then turned to her highest-ranking deputies sitting by her, and they proceeded to hammer Nadler for his lousy idea.</p> <p>In the weeks after, Pelosi launched full-bore into impeachment containment mode. She convened an emergency, mandatory meeting for all House Democrats in the basement of the Capitol, forcing her rank and file to listen as her investigative chairmen — including her ally, Intelligence panel Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — drilled down on a single message: Impeachment was premature. When House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) predicted on CNN that impeachment proceedings were becoming inevitable, staff in the speaker’s office yelled at his staff and demanded he walk the statement back.</p> <p>Pelosi’s tactics were effective. A caucus-wide fear of getting crosswise with the speaker made many rank-and-file Democrats think twice about joining the Judiciary’s audacious campaign that spring. Even the most gung-ho impeachment enthusiasts lacked the temerity to call Pelosi out by name for trying to quash their efforts.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/41/b6/a2c31bfd405298f117681ad37ce6/section-breaks-template.png\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">“The Magic Dick Language”</h3> <p><b>Not every Democrat </b>got the message — particularly Nadler.</p> <p>The brash New Yorker, who shuffled through the halls of Congress with a Constitution in his pocket, was growing increasingly frustrated with the speaker’s no-impeachment stance. That August, he’d instructed his aides to discreetly begin drafting articles against Trump, and he began crafting a bunch of new lines of investigative inquiry in hopes of trying to show the public that the president was dangerous.

He also told them to pull in officials for questioning about allegations Trump was considering abuse of the presidential pardon power<b> </b>to induce people to build his border wall without permits. And even though New York prosecutors had closed their campaign finance investigation into hush money payments Trump made during the 2016 campaign to women with whom he allegedly had had adulterous affairs, Nadler was convinced they had only sidestepped charging him because Justice Department rules barred the indictment of sitting presidents.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2c/6b/51bb93fe4974baf6258e23aae56d/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p>When the <i>Washington Post</i> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judiciary-committee-democrats-privately-map-out-possible-impeachment-articles-against-trump/2019/09/12/eecbc05a-d442-11e9-ab26-e6dbebac45d3_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;reported on Nadler’s plans to hold hearings on the hush payment scandal&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judiciary-committee-democrats-privately-map-out-possible-impeachment-articles-against-trump/2019/09/12/eecbc05a-d442-11e9-ab26-e6dbebac45d3_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf513f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf513f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">reported on Nadler’s plans to hold hearings on the hush payment scandal</a> — even floating the idea of giving Trump associates immunity for their testimony — Pelosi’s office scolded Nadler’s staff to drop the plans. Pelosi balked when Nadler tried to convince her that they needed to launch impeachment proceedings to break Trump’s stonewalling of all House subpoenas. The chairman argued that if Democrats launched impeachment proceedings, their court cases suing for evidence would move as quickly as similar cases had during the Watergate investigation in the 1970s.</p> <p>Pelosi wasn’t interested, however. Her top policy aide, Richard Meltzer, insisted to Nadler’s chief that when it came to impeachment, Pelosi was “<i>never</i> going to do it.”</p> <p>Meltzer, however, ended up proposing a compromise that would become Nadler’s salvation: He suggested they tell the courts the Judiciary panel was “investigating whether to recommend articles of impeachment.” The idea would give Nadler a chance to test his theory that opening the door to impeachment would speed up court proceedings to enforce subpoenas, without committing the House to follow through. In Meltzer’s estimation, the careful wording would also leave Pelosi enough wiggle room to insist to her skittish frontline members that the House was not actually in a real impeachment— just thinking about one.</p> <p>At first, Meltzer’s wordsmithing infuriated Nadler’s lawyers, who pejoratively referred to his contorted proposals as the “Magic Dick Language” — both a reference to Meltzer’s nickname and the sore feelings they harbored about the speaker’s tedious approach.</p> <p>But eventually, Nadler and his team came to view Meltzer’s solution as a blessing in disguise. By approving the committee’s filings, they realized, Pelosi could no longer claim that the House wasn’t locked and loaded on impeachment. She had effectively backed herself into a corner without realizing it.</p> <p>Around the same time, pressure began to mount from outside the Capitol. Reggie Hubbard, a congressional liaison for the liberal group MoveOn, visited Pelosi’s office to deliver a warning. Amid the speaker’s continued opposition to impeachment, progressive groups had started coalescing around the idea of confronting Pelosi with a public op-ed demanding the House take up impeachment.</p> <p>At the time, about 90 House Democrats had declared their support for impeachment. Hubbard wanted to know how many more were needed before the speaker agreed to move forward.</p> <p>“What number do y’all need to see to make calling for an inquiry viable?” Hubbard asked Pelosi’s outreach director Reva Price as the two sat in a small conference room in Pelosi’s suite. “140? 150?”</p> <p>“One hundred fifty would be nice,” Price told him, setting a number she thought would be hard to reach.</p> <p>Hubbard agreed to keep liberal groups off Pelosi’s back while he focused on reaching that number. But, he cautioned, “if we get to 150 and you still do nothing, you’re gonna have a problem with me, because I’m staking my entire reputation on this.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nadler bulled forward. The “Magic Dick language,” he realized, would allow him to publicly declare impeachment was underway — and Pelosi, due to the court filing, would be hard-pressed to stop him. So the first opportunity he got, he did just that on television.</p> <p>Pelosi was enraged. Once again, her staff called Nadler’s to lecture them for the assertion — and demand he stopped appearing on television.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/69/43/2db863234027aec08f93241662a0/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p>“You guys have to control your chairman!” her spokesman Ashley Etienne yelled at Judiciary lawyer Norm Eisen. “You have to get the chairman on the same page as the speaker!”<b>&nbsp;</b></p> <p>The conflict escalated as lawmakers returned from their August recess, confused — just like the media — about whether impeachment was really happening. Nadler insisted it was, pointing to Democrats’ court filings while Pelosi’s aides insisted it wasn’t. Pelosi’s team argued behind the scenes to reporters that Nadler was only talking tough on impeachment because he was getting slammed by a primary challenger questioning his liberal credentials. Nadler and his team, meanwhile, likened Pelosi to Keanu Reeves’s character Neo from the movie <i>The Matrix</i> due to her contorted approach.</p> <p>In private meetings, Pelosi tried to reassure her panicking frontline members that no matter what Nadler claimed publicly, only the full House could launch an impeachment inquiry. But Nadler had turned into a runaway chairman, and she was unable to reel him in.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/41/b6/a2c31bfd405298f117681ad37ce6/section-breaks-template.png\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">“The moderates have gone”</h3> <p><b>By late September, </b>Pelosi was starting to realize she could no longer hold the line on impeachment. An influential subset of her majority-makers in frontline districts was crafting an op-ed endorsing impeachment following news that Trump tried to leverage foreign aid to Ukraine for investigations of the Bidens.<b> </b>Pelosi knew that their piece would undermine her central reason for opposing impeachment: protecting them. Worse: it would create a jailbreak, as other Democrats on the fence about impeachment followed their lead, putting her in a bind.</p> <p>Pelosi had maintained an iron grip on power for 13 years due to one talent above all others: her ability to count. By that morning, the tally of House Democrats supporting an impeachment probe had almost reached 150 — the threshold the speaker’s staff had told liberal activists would be enough to change her mind. Whether she liked it or not, Pelosi faced a choice: She could either lose her caucus, or lead them in this new, almost inevitable direction.</p> <p>The headlines that were moving her members to embrace Trump’s ouster that weekend had not come as a surprise to Pelosi. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, had kept her appraised of the explosive whistleblower complaint<b> </b>laying out Trump’s quid pro quo with Ukraine well before that scandal became public. But even those revelations hadn’t immediately changed her mind about impeachment. The previous Friday, the speaker was still deflecting questions about whether it was time to oust Trump, telling NPR that “we don’t have the information” to make that decision.</p> <p>But that weekend, her party was starting to make the decision for her. Democrats’ liberal lions, who had refrained from attacking Pelosi personally over her reluctance to take up impeachment, started to cast the Ukraine revelations not only as an indictment of Trump’s presidency but of obstinate House Democratic leaders who wouldn’t bite the bullet on impeachment. “At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior — it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it,” progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted that weekend.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fe/98/a9d3e6394b5d8b2f377653acb363/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary7.jpg\"> <br> <p>The vitriol alarmed the speaker’s closest political advisers and staff, who grappled privately with how to confront their boss. The momentum for impeachment was undeniable, and they knew it was time for her to stop resisting. But Pelosi could be stubborn when under attack and didn’t condone being lectured by aides. Even members who traditionally deferred to her were beginning to plot their defections — and Pelosi wasn’t taking it well.</p> <p>When Rep. Katie Hill, a fellow Californian and frontline on Pelosi’s leadership team, phoned Pelosi directly that Saturday to give her a friendly heads-up that she intended to call for impeachment publicly, the speaker snapped. “Do what you have to,” Pelosi replied curtly, her tone so sharp that Hill decided not to endorse impeachment that day.</p> <p>But there was one member’s opinion she couldn’t ignore. For the first time that Saturday, Schiff, the speaker’s most trusted chairperson, told Pelosi they could no longer avoid the inevitable.</p> <p>“I think it’s time to move forward on impeachment,” he told her in a private phone call that Saturday.</p> <p>The two discussed the frontliner’s looming op-ed and agreed it would create a seismic shift in the Democratic caucus, likely bringing Pelosi to a moment of reckoning. Schiff asked Pelosi for her blessing to say on television the next morning that the House might have no options left but to impeach the president. If Schiff thought the latest allegations against Trump were grounds enough to impeach, Pelosi would be hard-pressed to disagree.</p> <p>On Sunday, Sept. 22, while Pelosi was attending a memorial service for Clyburn’s wife. Trump had acknowledged he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate the Bidens for “corruption.” In response, Pelosi<b> </b>had her staff craft a “Dear Colleague” letter accusing the Trump administration of “endangering our national security.” But she had conspicuously left out the word “impeachment,” keeping her members guessing.</p> <p>Yet Pelosi knew Trump’s actions were a stunning and egregious violation of ethical norms at the very least — and possibly a crime against the Constitution. She reached for her phone to call Nadler to let him know she was about to change course. Her majority-makers were writing a letter backing impeachment, she told him. It’s time to move.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6c/39/4407a6e74fb7984c8f354d4992a8/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary8.jpg\"> <br> <p>A handful of still-skittish members tried one last time to keep their leader from making the final decision. On Monday afternoon, New Jersey centrist Rep. Josh Gottheimer told Pelosi he worried impeachment would blow back on Democrats just as it had crippled Republicans in 1998 when they went after Clinton.</p> <p>“I don’t think I can hold this back anymore,” Pelosi told him, explaining that the looming op-ed was imminent. “The moderates have gone.”</p> <p>Gottheimer thanked her for the update, got off the phone, and promptly told the other centrists what the speaker had conveyed. “This is moving forward,” he told them. “We’re fucked.”</p> <p>Pelosi shared Gottheimer’s apprehension. She was under no illusion that impeachment would be a political winner. Still, she was determined to do everything in her power to make the impeachment process as politically painless as possible for her most vulnerable members.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/41/b6/a2c31bfd405298f117681ad37ce6/section-breaks-template.png\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">‘Build a better case’</h3> <p><b>Hundreds of members </b>were milling around the long rows of brown leather armchairs on the floor of the House of Representatives when the unfamiliar voice called out to Pelosi. Rep. Francis Rooney, a conservative Republican from Florida, had spotted the speaker across the room during the vote and was making a beeline for her.</p> <p>That day in November 2019, Democrats and Republicans were locked in a heated battle as one of the high-profile impeachment hearing witnesses testified before the nation about the Ukraine scandal. Rooney, however, was eager to get something off his chest.</p> <p>Just weeks before, the former businessman had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/politics/francis-rooney-florida-republican-trump-impeachment\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;gone on CNN and become the first House Republican to say he was open to impeaching the president&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/politics/francis-rooney-florida-republican-trump-impeachment&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf513f0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf513f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">gone on CNN and become the first House Republican to say he was open to impeaching the president</a>. The blowback had been so severe that he’d announced his decision to retire within 24 hours. Unlike the majority of his GOP colleagues who had excused Trump’s conduct, he was open to considering voting to impeach his party’s leader — if the evidence demanded it. Rooney wanted to hear from a credible, primary source who could put the Ukraine quid pro quo in Trump’s mouth. Rooney wanted a John Dean, the White House counsel who had delivered President Richard Nixon a devastating blow when he testified that the president told him personally to pay off the Watergate burglars.</p> <p>As far as Rooney was concerned, Democrats had had several opportunities to produce such a witness but had shied away from all of them. National Security Adviser John Bolton, Trump’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had all been named as participants in or witnesses to Trump’s Ukraine scheme. Rooney could not understand why Democrats hadn’t already subpoenaed them. He couldn’t understand why Pelosi was trying to jam what was typically a months-long, if not years-long, impeachment process into just a few weeks. It had taken more than a year for the Senate Watergate Committee, and then the House Judiciary Committee, to penetrate Nixon’s inner circle. If Democrats were serious about finding the truth, Rooney believed they needed to go to the courts to fight for blockbuster witnesses — and he resolved to tell Pelosi as much that very day.</p> <p>“Why don’t you slow down and fight Bolton’s privilege claim in court so you can get all the evidence — like Peter Rodino and Sam Ervin did in Watergate?” he asked Pelosi, referring to the impeachment leaders of yore. In the 1970s, he reminded Pelosi, lawmakers successfully fought in court to get secret tapes of Nixon’s conversations about the Watergate burglary — evidence that once procured, instantly turned the public, and even the crooked president’s most ardent Republican defenders, against him. The real jury, Rooney continued, “is the American people.”</p> <p>“Take your time and build a better case,” Rooney implored her.</p> <p>Pelosi smiled wanly at Rooney. She wasn’t used to being challenged directly about strategy by individual rank-and-file members. She didn’t even disagree; back in September she had quoted Abraham Lincoln’s admonition “With public sentiment, nothing can fail.” But if the public were going to be educated, Pelosi had decided it would have to be a crash course. “I appreciate that, but we can’t change gears now,” Pelosi told Rooney. Going to the courts to secure the testimony of Trump’s inner circle, she argued, would trigger court battles that could take months they didn’t have to spare.</p> <p>Rooney was unsatisfied with her answer. “If there is enough evidence to justify impeachment, I will vote for it,” Rooney said. “But there’s not enough evidence right now. It looks like more of a political process — and I can’t vote for that.”</p> <p>Democrats, Pelosi told Rooney, “have a process — and we’re going to follow it.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a5/16/ffaf3ccd401bb103ed8822f866ea/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary9.jpg\"> <br> <p>Yet Pelosi’s process was all about speed. In an early meeting, she and her allies had persuaded caucus leaders to move quickly and focus on the Ukraine allegations, foregoing deep dives into other Trump misdeeds. That meant leaving behind probes and public hearings about Trump allegedly obstructing justice, profiting off the Oval Office, doling out pardons for political favors and paying off women alleging affairs with him during his 2016 campaign.</p> <p>She also put the inquiry on a timeline. Her frontline wanted the entire probe to be wrapped up by the end of the year so they could move the nationwide conversation back to legislation. It was vital, they believed, for their own reelections.</p> <p>The Ukraine-only mandate had caused tension — and regret — with some top Democrats. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a former professor of constitutional law, had tried to warn Pelosi and her team that the Ukraine saga was too complex for the public to comprehend. That Democrats should expand their inquiry to include Trump’s violations of the Constitution’s prohibition of a president profiting off the Oval Office, which he thought voters could better digest. Others were concerned that the party was leaving serious Trump-related allegations on the cutting room floor — allegations that would paint a fuller picture of an unhinged and unethical man in the West Wing.</p> <p>Pelosi’s timeline had also set off a tug-of-war between Nadler and Schiff over how much time each committee got for their own hearings. Pelosi wanted the final vote to happen by Dec. 19, the last day of the congressional session. But wary of GOP process complaints,<b> </b>Nadler’s impeachment team insisted that they needed time to allow for the cross-examination of witnesses, the kind of due process that had been done in impeachment past. When Pelosi refused, Nadler’s aides would complain privately that the proceedings were “dumb,” “illegal” and “unconstitutional.” Just as Nadler had warned, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy took the procedural bungles and whipped his skittish members into a frenzy.</p> <p>The obsession with the calendar complicated Democrats’ attempt to secure a conviction — and to turn the public against Trump. It would leave only two weeks for the party to make their case to the public in high-profile hearings that in Nixon’s time took months. What’s more, during private discussions, investigators agreed they didn’t have time to fight in court for blockbuster witnesses from Trump’s inner circle. Court cases took months at best to litigate — and they were sure to drag out in 2020, an election year, complicating the frontliners’ demands to move the conversation back to their own legislative victories. Investigators also privately worried that if they sought to enforce their subpoenas in court and received adverse rulings, they couldn’t impeach Trump for obstructing Congress, as they’d hoped to do.</p> <p>Beyond the quick, narrow focus, Pelosi had also missed multiple opportunities to win moderate Republicans to their side. Unlike in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, she and her leadership team never bothered to loop Republicans in on the rules of the road for the impeachment process — a cold shoulder that would repel critical centrists like Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), who were privately repulsed by Trump’s behavior but equally turned off by the partisan nature of the probe. Pelosi also chose Schiff to lead the inquiry, one of the most despised lawmakers to the right, who had no credibility with Republicans and thus was hindered from the get-go.</p> <p>By the time Rooney had approached her on the House floor, the speaker knew her worst fear about impeachment was being realized. In an impeachment strategy session with some of her top messengers in the caucus just days before, she had brandished polling suggesting that Democrats wouldn’t be able to persuade Republicans to impeach at all. Even before Democrats took their case public in the hearings being aired that week, Pelosi had been tempering expectations, warning her leadership team that the sessions wouldn’t likely change the public’s perception of the Democrats’ case. She had essentially given up on the idea of winning over swaths of Republicans — a significant admission of defeat from a speaker who had once insisted that it was imperative that impeachment be bipartisan.</p> <p>Instead, she took her frustration out on Trump. The president, she told her colleagues, was a “freeloader in chief.” Or maybe the “parasite in chief.” Actually, his whole family was, she corrected herself: “The Trumps are all parasites.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fb/a2/7baee45348129937c12e6520ead5/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary10.jpg\"> <br> <p>“This guy is a thug,” she fumed, “and he still ropes in 40 percent of the country.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/41/b6/a2c31bfd405298f117681ad37ce6/section-breaks-template.png\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">‘Let me tell you about Spain!’</h3> <p><b>By early December, </b>impeachment was the last thing Pelosi wanted to talk about. Her moderates who had stuck their necks out to back the effort were getting crucified for it at home, and the more the nation focused on their investigation, the harder she knew it would be for those vulnerable members to win reelection.</p> <p>“We need to change the narrative,” Congressman Anthony Brindisi, a New York Democrat from a Trump district, had told her in one meeting that fall. “We need a trade deal!” Congresswoman Haley Stevens of Michigan piped up in another, demanding Pelosi prioritize those negotiations with Trump over the endless barrage of impeachment messaging.</p> <p>Pelosi sought to assuage them.</p> <p>“We’ll have USMCA by Christmas,” she promised, referring to the forming trade agreement, the U.S.- Mexico- Canada Agreement, by its acronym. “A prescription drug bill as well.”</p> <p>The truth was Pelosi was just as desperate as her moderates to push back against the suggestion that Democrats were solely focused on impeachment. She had been throwing the weight of her gavel behind a series of easy-sell bills on feel-good subjects like helping veterans and improving voting rights. She also started calling out Senate Republicans for refusing to take them up. Twice that fall, she had even marched over to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell’s office to protest his lack of action on legislation involving background checks for gun sales and immigration, a dramatic gesture that at any other time would have garnered major headlines. Against the backdrop of the final throes of impeachment, however, it barely made the media blink. All they wanted to talk about was the impending impeachment.</p> <p>Her desperation to change the narrative was on full display during <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/can-we-not-have-any-more-questions-about-impeachment-pelosi-asks-during-cnn-town-hall-1475840\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a CNN town hall on Dec. 5, 2019&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/can-we-not-have-any-more-questions-about-impeachment-pelosi-asks-during-cnn-town-hall-1475840&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf513f0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf513f0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a CNN town hall on Dec. 5, 2019</a>, as attendees peppered her with questions about removing Trump.</p> <p>“Can we not have any more questions about impeachment?” Pelosi asked the host and audience with exasperation, trying to steer the subject to her recent climate policy trip to Madrid. “Let me tell you about Spain!”</p> <p>Two months later, in the days that followed Trump’s acquittal in the Senate, when the president’s approval ratings reached the highest they had been since his inauguration, Pelosi would clamp down on congressional oversight and do all that she could to ensure House probes of Trump went underground. In a series of mid-February meetings in early 2020, the speaker would insist that Democrats stop focusing on Trump’s misdeeds and pivot all of their attention to policy before the election. No more high-profile Trump hearings. No more never-ending investigations.</p> <p>“No more freelancing, no more emoluments,” she said sternly during a Feb. 11 meeting. “Get back to jobs and health care.”</p> <p>That meant ignoring blockbuster revelations in former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s book, where for the first time, a member of Trump’s inner circle wrote that Trump was indeed aware of and orchestrated the quid pro quo, leveraging taxpayer money for Ukrainian probes of his adversaries. When news about politicization out of the Southern District of New York’s investigation of Trump’s campaign finance violations surfaced, she tamped down an internal effort to impeach Attorney General Barr.</p> <p>Eventually, much of the public would forget all about Democrats’ oversight, as the Covid-19 pandemic swept the nation and became the driving issue ahead of Trump’s reelection effort. The issue wouldn’t even merit a mention in either party’s presidential conventions.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/41/b6/a2c31bfd405298f117681ad37ce6/section-breaks-template.png\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">‘Impeach him now’</h3> <p><b>And then it happened</b> all over again.</p> <p>On Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump followers, goaded by his lies suggesting the 2020 reelection was stolen from him, stormed the Capitol and sent lawmakers fleeing for their lives. It was as horrific as it was predictable, given how Trump’s first impeachment had only emboldened his reckless behavior. Suddenly, Pelosi’s caucus was plunged into a second impeachment crisis.</p> <p>But if there were lessons to be taken from the first effort to oust Trump — about not pulling punches and leaving no investigative stone unturned — they were not applied to the second. Driven by their own outrage at what had happened inside the Capitol and a rapidly vanishing amount of time to hold Trump accountable, Democrats under Pelosi once again bulled forward at a breakneck tempo, leaving half the nation behind on the significance of what Trump had done and crippling their own effort to secure a conviction. But Pelosi was still hesitant.</p> <p>In a late-night, emergency Zoom meeting with her leadership team on Saturday, Jan. 9, Pelosi discussed whether a second effort to oust Trump was even necessary. She and her staff had shut down an effort by rank-and-file progressives to impeach the former president the very night of the riot. And since then, Pelosi had been trying to find an offramp, knowing full well that other Democratic leaders were concerned about a second effort delaying Biden’s agenda and nominations to fill his Cabinet. Pelosi had also personally asked Schiff to make the case against another impeachment to their colleagues. And despite his public claim to support another effort, the Intelligence leader did as Pelosi requested, arguing that Democrats should be on the same page as the new president — and that if they went after Trump in his waning days in office, it would look like they were just trying to keep him from running again.</p> <p>Yet during the Saturday call, even Pelosi’s advisers who had urged a more deliberate strategy during the first impeachment were now pressing for an accelerated process. After Schiff insisted Democrats “need to be looking forward,” Nadler pushed back hard. Trump’s actions, he argued, were so egregious they necessitated taking articles straight to the floor. Forget an investigation, Nadler continued. Forget a Judiciary Committee markup. They didn’t need to gather evidence and hold hearings. Lawmakers, he pointed out, had watched a crime unfold before their eyes.</p> <p>“Impeach him now,” Nadler argued. “They can give him due process in the Senate trial.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/40/cb/100339ca418e8c2aa8ba45a90c3b/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary11.jpg\"> <br> <p>It was a sharp departure from the principled stand the New York Democrat had taken during the first impeachment — and yet another sign that the ground beneath the speaker was once again shifting rapidly. Nadler had always been a stickler for doing impeachment the “right” way — not to mention fiercely territorial about protecting his committee’s jurisdiction and giving the president due process rights in the House.</p> <p>Of the four previous times in U.S. history that Congress had tried to impeach a president, only one had transpired without a full investigation and debate: the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. In 1868, lawmakers impeached Johnson in a fit of rage over a weekend when he replaced the secretary of war with a political crony. Only after that vote did the House draft articles, an effort so shoddily done that most impeachment experts rarely spoke of it. In fact, many influential scholars would come to view the entire exercise as congressional misuse of power. (Johnson was also narrowly acquitted by the Senate.)</p> <p>But on the leadership call that night, none of Pelosi’s deputies advocated for a go-slow process — most argued that speed in this case would be a virtue, not a weakness.</p> <p>“If Johnson could be hastily impeached for replacing a Cabinet secretary, we can charge Trump for inciting an armed rebellion against Congress,” Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) told the group.</p> <p>To the risk-averse speaker, reverting to impeachment by snap vote was a risky proposition. <i>Could they really do this without a full impeachment process? Could they move forward without a committee report and evidentiary record? </i>Again, seeing the writing on the wall, Pelosi caved. It was time to move, and move quickly, she told her team.</p> <p>“The Senate will do what the Senate will do,” Pelosi said firmly. “That’s not our concern.”</p> <p>A week after the riot, the House voted to impeach Trump for a second time.</p> <p>The strategies that Pelosi employed in both impeachments are sure to have long-term consequences for Hill oversight — and for future presidents. There is now precedent for half-baked impeachments that include a highly subjective and ad hoc standard of due process for an accused president, that does not include or require firsthand testimony, or any major attempt to persuade members of the other party or their voters. Worse, due to Pelosi’s decision not to fight for witnesses in court, some historians fear there is now a new model for unencumbered executive power, as presidents replicate Trump’s playbook for ignoring all Hill oversight and getting away with it, undermining checks and balances.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/86/6b/6c493f3243119fc7735c04a0ebff/mag.Bade.PelosiLegacy-Secondary12.jpg\"> <br> <p>“Trump wanted to test the power of Congress,” said Naftali, the NYU professor. “Speaker Pelosi’s preferred strategy, however, left no time for Congress to counterattack and go to the courts to define for the future what a president’s constitutional obligation is to a Congress in an impeachment. And thus, left open the possibility that in the future, presidents will completely stonewall Congress.</p> <p>“It’s a very dangerous precedent,” he said, “and it’s a precedent because of the Democratic leadership’s decision in 2019 not to go to court to seek the information it should have under our Constitution in an impeachment inquiry.”</p> <p>Naftali, who has written books about the history of impeachment, has another fear: that impeachments after the Trump years will become merely an expression of partisan rage rather than a last resort to save the republic. Due to the shortcuts that have now been paved, there’s nothing stopping majorities in both parties from impeaching presidents on a whim and with little buy-in from the other side. Already Republicans are calling for their party to impeach Biden over a host of policy differences — an idea the nation’s founders debated and firmly rejected. And once that happens, Naftali warns, it will continue to occur over and over again.</p> <p>“I’m very worried that impeachment is going to be viewed as a way of rallying a base, making it completely political as opposed to a constitutional act.” Naftali warned. “Impeachment is there to protect the system; it’s not there to engage in a vendetta. What is happening now is a complete untethering of impeachment from its Constitutional origins.”</p> <p>Many Pelosi defenders will point to the Jan. 6 committee’s meticulous, no-holds-barred investigative work and conclude the caucus has done its job. But while the panel is summoning every witness from Trump’s inner circle, and fighting for — and even winning — court cases to enforce their subpoenas, critics of Pelosi’s strategy question if the crucial moment to persuade the public of Trump’s danger to the republic was squandered.</p> <p>“We look at what the Jan. 6 committee is accomplishing and say, ‘Gosh, if the Jan. 6 committee can do this, why couldn’t the House have done this?” Vladeck said. “We can’t know what would have happened if the Democrats had been more aggressive from the get-go. But it’s hard to imagine we’d be in a worse place.”<br></p> <br> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Nancy Pelosi rode the elevator down three levels deep into the basement of the Capitol. It was late June of 2019 and aides to the speaker of the House had just sent an emergency summons to the top lawyers on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, beckoning them to meet the California Democrat at the House’s Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, known as the “SCIF.” Given the classified documents she was about to read, the aides knew Pelosi would want answers fast.\n A few days prior, Former President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr had handed over a trove of previously undisclosed portions of the Mueller Report that he had initially refused to show Congress. Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) had been itching to get his hands on the files for weeks, and now Pelosi knew why.\n As Pelosi pored over the redacted pages of Mueller’s report, she froze on a passage from the unpublicized section. In his own words, Mueller questioned the honesty of Trump’s written testimony to prosecutors when he said “he did not recall ‘the specifics of any call’” he had had with his friend Roger Stone regarding Russia’s hack of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. That claim clashed with other witnesses, Mueller wrote, who testified that Trump did discuss the act of political sabotage with Stone and others. Trump — Mueller was indicating — had perjured himself. In fact, Mueller suggested that Trump may have also encouraged his allies to conveniently forget those conversations when they spoke to investigators, hinting that those who helped cover up unsavory details would be rewarded.\n As Pelosi looked up from the pages, a combination of disbelief and devastation on her face. She caught the gaze of Judiciary Committee counsel Aaron Hiller, who eagerly awaited her reaction.\n “Aaron,” Pelosi said, “do you think this is impeachable?”\n The question was far from a random one. Since the previous month, Nadler and a group of progressives on the House Judiciary Committee had tried to push Pelosi to launch an effort to oust Trump. They’d secretly started a whipping campaign, buttonholing their Democratic colleagues to publicly endorse an “impeachment inquiry.” The effort had created a media furor, as reporters began counting the rising number of House Democrats who supported the probe.\n The Judiciary rebels’ tactics had been aimed at one person: Pelosi herself. The speaker, they knew, was an impeachment skeptic who viewed such an effort as a political boomerang that once launched could not be controlled. She feared that by going after Trump, she would jeopardize her own hard-won majority — and could even hand Trump a second term. It was why, after Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) had been caught on camera brashly vowing to “impeach the motherfucker” on the first day of the new Congress, Pelosi worked to tamp down the sentiment fast. It was why she had told a reporter that “he’s not worth it” in March of that year — as in, not worth impeaching. And it was why, after the Mueller Report came out suggesting Trump obstructed justice as many as 10 times, Pelosi had strongly rebuffed arguments — including from her own Judiciary chairman — that the evidence in the mammoth 448-page report was grounds for removal.\n But in the basement of the Capitol that day, Pelosi saw just how far Trump may have gone in trying to hamstring Mueller’s work. Lying to a federal prosecutor was a federal offense. So was obstructing a federal investigation.\n The assembled panel lawyers all began talking at once when Pelosi asked the Judiciary aide whether such evidence was enough to indict the president. The speaker silenced them with a flick of her palm. Turning back to Hiller, she repeated her question: “Aaron, do you think this is an impeachable offense?”\n The room went silent as everyone turned to the counsel, who didn’t hesitate.\n “Yes, ma’am,” Hiller answered. “I do.”\n \n  \n If Pelosi agreed, she did not say. But the knowledge that Trump may have tried to obstruct justice so blatantly — actions that almost certainly would have led to criminal charges against any other American — did not make her change course. Emerging from that basement room, she worked as hard as ever that summer to quell the rising tide of impeachment. She told her aides during one July staff meeting that “I don’t care if they’re all for it!”— meaning she wouldn’t support impeachment even if she was the last holdout in her caucus. In the end, of course, she would preside over not one but two impeachments, and both would fail to oust Trump.\n As Pelosi gears up for her expected retirement should Republicans retake the House in November, historians and pundits are sure to reflect on the vast legacy of the country’s first female speaker. The one-time housewife from California will be rightly celebrated for the trail she blazed through representative politics, earning renown as one of the Democratic Party’s most formidable fundraisers, strategists and dealmakers. That former President Barack Obama’s eponymous health care law is providing coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans today is a credit to Pelosi’s careful, steel-spined stewardship. And she has helped deliver major legislative victories for President Joe Biden, shepherding passage of an expansive social safety net, a once-in-a-generation infrastructure investment and massive Covid-19 relief.\n \nBut her legacy will also be defined by the ways she managed her party’s impeachment efforts and for the long-term corrosive effects of those failed efforts on the nation’s political landscape as well as the Congress’ capacity to wield its massive oversight powers fairly and effectively. There’s a widespread but inaccurate belief that the two impeachments were doomed to failure, that no matter what facts emerged Democrats would never be able to overcome Republican fealty to Trump. But this downplays the important role Pelosi played in crafting the Democrats’ strategy.\n \nIn our new book, Unchecked: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump\",\"_id\":\"00000183-e753-d231-abc3-f7f3f0f30000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Unchecked: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump, we draw on more than 250 interviews to reveal how Pelosi viewed impeachment — and aggressive oversight of Trump — as problematic for her majority and for Democrats politically. How, despite other Democrats fighting for her to do more, Pelosi worked behind the scenes to slow efforts to hold Trump accountable. We show how the speaker accustomed to steering her fractious caucus with an iron grip, lost control to a band of liberal Democrats, who whipped together an effective mutiny of members after Trump tried to leverage taxpayer dollars in Ukraine to secure his own reelection. The book details how Pelosi, in a bid to wrest back her authority, did an about-face, ultimately embracing impeachment — but only half-heartedly. Even Democrats privately say Pelosi undercut her own impeachment inquiry by prioritizing politics over fact-finding. In her eagerness to get impeachment done by Christmas so her frontliners could pivot to talking about legislation she viewed as necessary to protect Democrats’ majority, she put the probe on an artificially accelerated timeline that doomed it to failure before Democrats had made their strongest case against Trump to the nation. That meant sidelining investigative threads that could have exposed a fuller and more complete picture of Trump’s misdeeds.\n \n“It’s not the House’s job to self-censor and be timid; it’s the House’s job to build the most compelling case for impeachment,” said Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at University of Texas School of Law. “The House limited itself in ways that made it very easy for even potentially gettable senators to turn around and say, ‘Well you didn’t do this; we’re not going to do it for you.’”\n The book makes clear the cost of her strategy — support from persuadable Republicans and the general public. Pelosi’s efforts to constrain Nadler ended up exposing Trump’s first impeachment to accusations of procedural impropriety and “unconstitutionality” — even from other Democrats — leading moderate Republicans privately concerned about Trump’s misdeeds to nonetheless fall in line with their party. It describes in detail how Pelosi shrugged off the advice of a sympathetic Republican who implored her to take more time to create a record of first-hand witnesses against Trump, even offering to impeach if she’d fight in the courts for such testimony.\n \n  \n Even after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, an impeachment-wary Pelosi wasn't immediately sold on a second effort to oust him. Fearing impeachment could upend Biden’s agenda, she stifled an effort to impeach Trump that very night and queried her allies whether a second attempt at removal was necessary at all. (Pelosi and her office initially cooperated with our book. But upon learning about some of the revelations we’d gathered from sources close to her — revelations not sanctioned to be released publicly — the speaker’s office cut us off and chided lawmakers and House Democratic aides for revealing too much. Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hammill has called the thesis of the book “a futile exercise of whataboutism.”)\n Pelosi is by no means solely or even primarily responsible for Trump’s two acquittals. Hill Republicans, our book shows, privately worried about the president’s norm-shattering behavior — yet abandoned their scruples to protect him out of fear and political opportunism. They also engaged in obstructionist tactics that played a significant role in unleashing Trump to more grave acts of recklessness, putting the party ahead of the country by turning a blind eye to his behavior.\n But decisions that the speaker made out of political caution and calculation also boosted Trump’s chances at a comeback, leaving the 45th president room for a possible return to the West Wing. The ultimate result, however, was more than two acquittals of Trump. Pelosi’s failed effort, some experts believe, exposed the devastating limits of impeachment, Congress’ most powerful tool for holding a president to account. Trump’s moves to run roughshod over congressional subpoenas and investigations — and Democrats’ acquiescence under the speaker — created a standard of unhindered executive power for future leaders to emulate and exploit.\n “Speaker Pelosi’s preference for a quick impeachment that would not drag down Democratic chances in the 2020 election made it impossible to do the sustain rear-guard action necessary to shore up impeachment in the face of the Trump onslaught,” said presidential historian, impeachment expert and New York University professor Timothy Naftali.\n “There was conventional wisdom in Washington that there was no way of getting Republican support and therefore it was not really worth making the effort. That was a mistake…Even if you weren’t going to turn a single [Republican], the effort was constitutionally necessary for the public.”\n \n  \n Impeachment skeptic\n Nancy Pelosi never liked impeachment.\n In 1998, she had witnessed how then-Speaker Newt Gingrich’s attempt to impeach then-President Bill Clinton had backfired. Instead of ousting Clinton for lying under oath about having received oral sex in the West Wing, the Senate rejected the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice — and in the process, Gingrich’s party had rejected him. Gingrich ended up resigning as speaker after the GOP lost House seats in what became the poorest midterm election performance by a party that didn’t control the White House in 60 years. And Clinton ended up enjoying a political lift, as his approval ratings climbed to a post-impeachment 73 percent.\n \n  \n During her first turn as speaker in 2007, Pelosi had easily put down calls from her party’s left flank to impeach then-President George W. Bush over the Iraq War. Even after picketers surrounded her home and slept in her driveway, Pelosi insisted her caucus stay focused on legislating — and she had been rewarded for it: Two years later, Democrats swept the 2008 elections to seize the White House and expand their majorities in Congress.\n On the night her party flipped the House in 2018, in a PBS NewsHour interview just hours after the first polls closed, Pelosi tried to head off the talk that was already swirling about ousting Trump. “For those who want impeachment, that’s not what our caucus is about,” Pelosi said. “That is not unifying, and I get criticized in my own party for not being more in support of that. But… if [impeachment] would happen, it would have to be bipartisan and the evidence would have to be so conclusive.”\n But Pelosi couldn’t deter the members of her caucus who were determined to find that conclusive proof. She had to contend with people like Nadler and his Judiciary renegades. That spring, as unenforced House subpoenas piled up due to Trump’s stonewalling, Nadler blessed his members to confront Pelosi about impeachment. Pelosi had balked during the huddle. And immediately after, had summoned Nadler to her office for late-night grilling.\n “I’m not saying ‘Let’s draw up impeachment articles,’ but we shouldn’t be afraid of saying the word,” Nadler told Pelosi that night, defending himself. “We are engaged in mortal combat across the board to get even bare-bones information from the Justice Department. How do you think we’re going to get these people in [to testify] if we don’t say the word ‘impeachment’?”\n Pelosi bristled.\n “The Democratic caucus doesn’t support the idea, let alone the American public,” she shot back. “We’re in the majority because of about two dozen members, and all of the evidence we have in front of us shows that those people will be taking a profound risk if they talk about impeachment — if you talk about impeachment.”\n \n  \n She then turned to her highest-ranking deputies sitting by her, and they proceeded to hammer Nadler for his lousy idea.\n In the weeks after, Pelosi launched full-bore into impeachment containment mode. She convened an emergency, mandatory meeting for all House Democrats in the basement of the Capitol, forcing her rank and file to listen as her investigative chairmen — including her ally, Intelligence panel Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — drilled down on a single message: Impeachment was premature. When House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) predicted on CNN that impeachment proceedings were becoming inevitable, staff in the speaker’s office yelled at his staff and demanded he walk the statement back.\n Pelosi’s tactics were effective. A caucus-wide fear of getting crosswise with the speaker made many rank-and-file Democrats think twice about joining the Judiciary’s audacious campaign that spring. Even the most gung-ho impeachment enthusiasts lacked the temerity to call Pelosi out by name for trying to quash their efforts.\n \n  \n “The Magic Dick Language”\n Not every Democrat got the message — particularly Nadler.\n The brash New Yorker, who shuffled through the halls of Congress with a Constitution in his pocket, was growing increasingly frustrated with the speaker’s no-impeachment stance. That August, he’d instructed his aides to discreetly begin drafting articles against Trump, and he began crafting a bunch of new lines of investigative inquiry in hopes of trying to show the public that the president was dangerous. When reports surfaced suggesting Trump was having administration officials stay at his resorts on the taxpayer dime, Nadler had his staff schedule a public hearing on whether Trump had violated the Constitution’s prohibitions against personally profiting off the Oval Office. He also told them to pull in officials for questioning about allegations Trump was considering abuse of the presidential pardon power to induce people to build his border wall without permits. And even though New York prosecutors had closed their campaign finance investigation into hush money payments Trump made during the 2016 campaign to women with whom he allegedly had had adulterous affairs, Nadler was convinced they had only sidestepped charging him because Justice Department rules barred the indictment of sitting presidents.\n \n  \n When the Washington Post reported on Nadler’s plans to hold hearings on the hush payment scandal — even floating the idea of giving Trump associates immunity for their testimony — Pelosi’s office scolded Nadler’s staff to drop the plans. Pelosi balked when Nadler tried to convince her that they needed to launch impeachment proceedings to break Trump’s stonewalling of all House subpoenas. The chairman argued that if Democrats launched impeachment proceedings, their court cases suing for evidence would move as quickly as similar cases had during the Watergate investigation in the 1970s.\n Pelosi wasn’t interested, however. Her top policy aide, Richard Meltzer, insisted to Nadler’s chief that when it came to impeachment, Pelosi was “never going to do it.”\n Meltzer, however, ended up proposing a compromise that would become Nadler’s salvation: He suggested they tell the courts the Judiciary panel was “investigating whether to recommend articles of impeachment.” The idea would give Nadler a chance to test his theory that opening the door to impeachment would speed up court proceedings to enforce subpoenas, without committing the House to follow through. In Meltzer’s estimation, the careful wording would also leave Pelosi enough wiggle room to insist to her skittish frontline members that the House was not actually in a real impeachment— just thinking about one.\n At first, Meltzer’s wordsmithing infuriated Nadler’s lawyers, who pejoratively referred to his contorted proposals as the “Magic Dick Language” — both a reference to Meltzer’s nickname and the sore feelings they harbored about the speaker’s tedious approach.\n But eventually, Nadler and his team came to view Meltzer’s solution as a blessing in disguise. By approving the committee’s filings, they realized, Pelosi could no longer claim that the House wasn’t locked and loaded on impeachment. She had effectively backed herself into a corner without realizing it.\n Around the same time, pressure began to mount from outside the Capitol. Reggie Hubbard, a congressional liaison for the liberal group MoveOn, visited Pelosi’s office to deliver a warning. Amid the speaker’s continued opposition to impeachment, progressive groups had started coalescing around the idea of confronting Pelosi with a public op-ed demanding the House take up impeachment.\n At the time, about 90 House Democrats had declared their support for impeachment. Hubbard wanted to know how many more were needed before the speaker agreed to move forward.\n “What number do y’all need to see to make calling for an inquiry viable?” Hubbard asked Pelosi’s outreach director Reva Price as the two sat in a small conference room in Pelosi’s suite. “140? 150?”\n “One hundred fifty would be nice,” Price told him, setting a number she thought would be hard to reach.\n Hubbard agreed to keep liberal groups off Pelosi’s back while he focused on reaching that number. But, he cautioned, “if we get to 150 and you still do nothing, you’re gonna have a problem with me, because I’m staking my entire reputation on this.”\n Meanwhile, Nadler bulled forward. The “Magic Dick language,” he realized, would allow him to publicly declare impeachment was underway — and Pelosi, due to the court filing, would be hard-pressed to stop him. So the first opportunity he got, he did just that on television.\n Pelosi was enraged. Once again, her staff called Nadler’s to lecture them for the assertion — and demand he stopped appearing on television.\n \n  \n “You guys have to control your chairman!” her spokesman Ashley Etienne yelled at Judiciary lawyer Norm Eisen. “You have to get the chairman on the same page as the speaker!” \n The conflict escalated as lawmakers returned from their August recess, confused — just like the media — about whether impeachment was really happening. Nadler insisted it was, pointing to Democrats’ court filings while Pelosi’s aides insisted it wasn’t. Pelosi’s team argued behind the scenes to reporters that Nadler was only talking tough on impeachment because he was getting slammed by a primary challenger questioning his liberal credentials. Nadler and his team, meanwhile, likened Pelosi to Keanu Reeves’s character Neo from the movie The Matrix due to her contorted approach.\n In private meetings, Pelosi tried to reassure her panicking frontline members that no matter what Nadler claimed publicly, only the full House could launch an impeachment inquiry. But Nadler had turned into a runaway chairman, and she was unable to reel him in.\n \n  \n “The moderates have gone”\n By late September, Pelosi was starting to realize she could no longer hold the line on impeachment. An influential subset of her majority-makers in frontline districts was crafting an op-ed endorsing impeachment following news that Trump tried to leverage foreign aid to Ukraine for investigations of the Bidens. Pelosi knew that their piece would undermine her central reason for opposing impeachment: protecting them. Worse: it would create a jailbreak, as other Democrats on the fence about impeachment followed their lead, putting her in a bind.\n Pelosi had maintained an iron grip on power for 13 years due to one talent above all others: her ability to count. By that morning, the tally of House Democrats supporting an impeachment probe had almost reached 150 — the threshold the speaker’s staff had told liberal activists would be enough to change her mind. Whether she liked it or not, Pelosi faced a choice: She could either lose her caucus, or lead them in this new, almost inevitable direction.\n The headlines that were moving her members to embrace Trump’s ouster that weekend had not come as a surprise to Pelosi. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, had kept her appraised of the explosive whistleblower complaint laying out Trump’s quid pro quo with Ukraine well before that scandal became public. But even those revelations hadn’t immediately changed her mind about impeachment. The previous Friday, the speaker was still deflecting questions about whether it was time to oust Trump, telling NPR that “we don’t have the information” to make that decision.\n But that weekend, her party was starting to make the decision for her. Democrats’ liberal lions, who had refrained from attacking Pelosi personally over her reluctance to take up impeachment, started to cast the Ukraine revelations not only as an indictment of Trump’s presidency but of obstinate House Democratic leaders who wouldn’t bite the bullet on impeachment. “At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior — it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it,” progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted that weekend.\n \n  \n The vitriol alarmed the speaker’s closest political advisers and staff, who grappled privately with how to confront their boss. The momentum for impeachment was undeniable, and they knew it was time for her to stop resisting. But Pelosi could be stubborn when under attack and didn’t condone being lectured by aides. Even members who traditionally deferred to her were beginning to plot their defections — and Pelosi wasn’t taking it well.\n When Rep. Katie Hill, a fellow Californian and frontline on Pelosi’s leadership team, phoned Pelosi directly that Saturday to give her a friendly heads-up that she intended to call for impeachment publicly, the speaker snapped. “Do what you have to,” Pelosi replied curtly, her tone so sharp that Hill decided not to endorse impeachment that day.\n But there was one member’s opinion she couldn’t ignore. For the first time that Saturday, Schiff, the speaker’s most trusted chairperson, told Pelosi they could no longer avoid the inevitable.\n “I think it’s time to move forward on impeachment,” he told her in a private phone call that Saturday.\n The two discussed the frontliner’s looming op-ed and agreed it would create a seismic shift in the Democratic caucus, likely bringing Pelosi to a moment of reckoning. Schiff asked Pelosi for her blessing to say on television the next morning that the House might have no options left but to impeach the president. If Schiff thought the latest allegations against Trump were grounds enough to impeach, Pelosi would be hard-pressed to disagree.\n On Sunday, Sept. 22, while Pelosi was attending a memorial service for Clyburn’s wife. Trump had acknowledged he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate the Bidens for “corruption.” In response, Pelosi had her staff craft a “Dear Colleague” letter accusing the Trump administration of “endangering our national security.” But she had conspicuously left out the word “impeachment,” keeping her members guessing.\n Yet Pelosi knew Trump’s actions were a stunning and egregious violation of ethical norms at the very least — and possibly a crime against the Constitution. She reached for her phone to call Nadler to let him know she was about to change course. Her majority-makers were writing a letter backing impeachment, she told him. It’s time to move.\n \n  \n A handful of still-skittish members tried one last time to keep their leader from making the final decision. On Monday afternoon, New Jersey centrist Rep. Josh Gottheimer told Pelosi he worried impeachment would blow back on Democrats just as it had crippled Republicans in 1998 when they went after Clinton.\n “I don’t think I can hold this back anymore,” Pelosi told him, explaining that the looming op-ed was imminent. “The moderates have gone.”\n Gottheimer thanked her for the update, got off the phone, and promptly told the other centrists what the speaker had conveyed. “This is moving forward,” he told them. “We’re fucked.”\n Pelosi shared Gottheimer’s apprehension. She was under no illusion that impeachment would be a political winner. Still, she was determined to do everything in her power to make the impeachment process as politically painless as possible for her most vulnerable members.\n \n  \n ‘Build a better case’\n Hundreds of members were milling around the long rows of brown leather armchairs on the floor of the House of Representatives when the unfamiliar voice called out to Pelosi. Rep. Francis Rooney, a conservative Republican from Florida, had spotted the speaker across the room during the vote and was making a beeline for her.\n That day in November 2019, Democrats and Republicans were locked in a heated battle as one of the high-profile impeachment hearing witnesses testified before the nation about the Ukraine scandal. Rooney, however, was eager to get something off his chest.\n Just weeks before, the former businessman had gone on CNN and become the first House Republican to say he was open to impeaching the president. The blowback had been so severe that he’d announced his decision to retire within 24 hours. Unlike the majority of his GOP colleagues who had excused Trump’s conduct, he was open to considering voting to impeach his party’s leader — if the evidence demanded it. Rooney wanted to hear from a credible, primary source who could put the Ukraine quid pro quo in Trump’s mouth. Rooney wanted a John Dean, the White House counsel who had delivered President Richard Nixon a devastating blow when he testified that the president told him personally to pay off the Watergate burglars.\n As far as Rooney was concerned, Democrats had had several opportunities to produce such a witness but had shied away from all of them. National Security Adviser John Bolton, Trump’s chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had all been named as participants in or witnesses to Trump’s Ukraine scheme. Rooney could not understand why Democrats hadn’t already subpoenaed them. He couldn’t understand why Pelosi was trying to jam what was typically a months-long, if not years-long, impeachment process into just a few weeks. It had taken more than a year for the Senate Watergate Committee, and then the House Judiciary Committee, to penetrate Nixon’s inner circle. If Democrats were serious about finding the truth, Rooney believed they needed to go to the courts to fight for blockbuster witnesses — and he resolved to tell Pelosi as much that very day.\n “Why don’t you slow down and fight Bolton’s privilege claim in court so you can get all the evidence — like Peter Rodino and Sam Ervin did in Watergate?” he asked Pelosi, referring to the impeachment leaders of yore. In the 1970s, he reminded Pelosi, lawmakers successfully fought in court to get secret tapes of Nixon’s conversations about the Watergate burglary — evidence that once procured, instantly turned the public, and even the crooked president’s most ardent Republican defenders, against him. The real jury, Rooney continued, “is the American people.”\n “Take your time and build a better case,” Rooney implored her.\n Pelosi smiled wanly at Rooney. She wasn’t used to being challenged directly about strategy by individual rank-and-file members. She didn’t even disagree; back in September she had quoted Abraham Lincoln’s admonition “With public sentiment, nothing can fail.” But if the public were going to be educated, Pelosi had decided it would have to be a crash course. “I appreciate that, but we can’t change gears now,” Pelosi told Rooney. Going to the courts to secure the testimony of Trump’s inner circle, she argued, would trigger court battles that could take months they didn’t have to spare.\n Rooney was unsatisfied with her answer. “If there is enough evidence to justify impeachment, I will vote for it,” Rooney said. “But there’s not enough evidence right now. It looks like more of a political process — and I can’t vote for that.”\n Democrats, Pelosi told Rooney, “have a process — and we’re going to follow it.”\n \n  \n Yet Pelosi’s process was all about speed. In an early meeting, she and her allies had persuaded caucus leaders to move quickly and focus on the Ukraine allegations, foregoing deep dives into other Trump misdeeds. That meant leaving behind probes and public hearings about Trump allegedly obstructing justice, profiting off the Oval Office, doling out pardons for political favors and paying off women alleging affairs with him during his 2016 campaign.\n She also put the inquiry on a timeline. Her frontline wanted the entire probe to be wrapped up by the end of the year so they could move the nationwide conversation back to legislation. It was vital, they believed, for their own reelections.\n The Ukraine-only mandate had caused tension — and regret — with some top Democrats. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a former professor of constitutional law, had tried to warn Pelosi and her team that the Ukraine saga was too complex for the public to comprehend. That Democrats should expand their inquiry to include Trump’s violations of the Constitution’s prohibition of a president profiting off the Oval Office, which he thought voters could better digest. Others were concerned that the party was leaving serious Trump-related allegations on the cutting room floor — allegations that would paint a fuller picture of an unhinged and unethical man in the West Wing.\n Pelosi’s timeline had also set off a tug-of-war between Nadler and Schiff over how much time each committee got for their own hearings. Pelosi wanted the final vote to happen by Dec. 19, the last day of the congressional session. But wary of GOP process complaints, Nadler’s impeachment team insisted that they needed time to allow for the cross-examination of witnesses, the kind of due process that had been done in impeachment past. When Pelosi refused, Nadler’s aides would complain privately that the proceedings were “dumb,” “illegal” and “unconstitutional.” Just as Nadler had warned, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy took the procedural bungles and whipped his skittish members into a frenzy.\n The obsession with the calendar complicated Democrats’ attempt to secure a conviction — and to turn the public against Trump. It would leave only two weeks for the party to make their case to the public in high-profile hearings that in Nixon’s time took months. What’s more, during private discussions, investigators agreed they didn’t have time to fight in court for blockbuster witnesses from Trump’s inner circle. Court cases took months at best to litigate — and they were sure to drag out in 2020, an election year, complicating the frontliners’ demands to move the conversation back to their own legislative victories. Investigators also privately worried that if they sought to enforce their subpoenas in court and received adverse rulings, they couldn’t impeach Trump for obstructing Congress, as they’d hoped to do.\n Beyond the quick, narrow focus, Pelosi had also missed multiple opportunities to win moderate Republicans to their side. Unlike in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, she and her leadership team never bothered to loop Republicans in on the rules of the road for the impeachment process — a cold shoulder that would repel critical centrists like Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), who were privately repulsed by Trump’s behavior but equally turned off by the partisan nature of the probe. Pelosi also chose Schiff to lead the inquiry, one of the most despised lawmakers to the right, who had no credibility with Republicans and thus was hindered from the get-go.\n By the time Rooney had approached her on the House floor, the speaker knew her worst fear about impeachment was being realized. In an impeachment strategy session with some of her top messengers in the caucus just days before, she had brandished polling suggesting that Democrats wouldn’t be able to persuade Republicans to impeach at all. Even before Democrats took their case public in the hearings being aired that week, Pelosi had been tempering expectations, warning her leadership team that the sessions wouldn’t likely change the public’s perception of the Democrats’ case. She had essentially given up on the idea of winning over swaths of Republicans — a significant admission of defeat from a speaker who had once insisted that it was imperative that impeachment be bipartisan.\n Instead, she took her frustration out on Trump. The president, she told her colleagues, was a “freeloader in chief.” Or maybe the “parasite in chief.” Actually, his whole family was, she corrected herself: “The Trumps are all parasites.”\n \n  \n “This guy is a thug,” she fumed, “and he still ropes in 40 percent of the country.”\n \n  \n ‘Let me tell you about Spain!’\n By early December, impeachment was the last thing Pelosi wanted to talk about. Her moderates who had stuck their necks out to back the effort were getting crucified for it at home, and the more the nation focused on their investigation, the harder she knew it would be for those vulnerable members to win reelection.\n “We need to change the narrative,” Congressman Anthony Brindisi, a New York Democrat from a Trump district, had told her in one meeting that fall. “We need a trade deal!” Congresswoman Haley Stevens of Michigan piped up in another, demanding Pelosi prioritize those negotiations with Trump over the endless barrage of impeachment messaging.\n Pelosi sought to assuage them.\n “We’ll have USMCA by Christmas,” she promised, referring to the forming trade agreement, the U.S.- Mexico- Canada Agreement, by its acronym. “A prescription drug bill as well.”\n The truth was Pelosi was just as desperate as her moderates to push back against the suggestion that Democrats were solely focused on impeachment. She had been throwing the weight of her gavel behind a series of easy-sell bills on feel-good subjects like helping veterans and improving voting rights. She also started calling out Senate Republicans for refusing to take them up. Twice that fall, she had even marched over to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell’s office to protest his lack of action on legislation involving background checks for gun sales and immigration, a dramatic gesture that at any other time would have garnered major headlines. Against the backdrop of the final throes of impeachment, however, it barely made the media blink. All they wanted to talk about was the impending impeachment.\n Her desperation to change the narrative was on full display during a CNN town hall on Dec. 5, 2019, as attendees peppered her with questions about removing Trump.\n “Can we not have any more questions about impeachment?” Pelosi asked the host and audience with exasperation, trying to steer the subject to her recent climate policy trip to Madrid. “Let me tell you about Spain!”\n Two months later, in the days that followed Trump’s acquittal in the Senate, when the president’s approval ratings reached the highest they had been since his inauguration, Pelosi would clamp down on congressional oversight and do all that she could to ensure House probes of Trump went underground. In a series of mid-February meetings in early 2020, the speaker would insist that Democrats stop focusing on Trump’s misdeeds and pivot all of their attention to policy before the election. No more high-profile Trump hearings. No more never-ending investigations.\n “No more freelancing, no more emoluments,” she said sternly during a Feb. 11 meeting. “Get back to jobs and health care.”\n That meant ignoring blockbuster revelations in former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s book, where for the first time, a member of Trump’s inner circle wrote that Trump was indeed aware of and orchestrated the quid pro quo, leveraging taxpayer money for Ukrainian probes of his adversaries. When news about politicization out of the Southern District of New York’s investigation of Trump’s campaign finance violations surfaced, she tamped down an internal effort to impeach Attorney General Barr.\n Eventually, much of the public would forget all about Democrats’ oversight, as the Covid-19 pandemic swept the nation and became the driving issue ahead of Trump’s reelection effort. The issue wouldn’t even merit a mention in either party’s presidential conventions.\n \n  \n ‘Impeach him now’\n And then it happened all over again.\n On Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump followers, goaded by his lies suggesting the 2020 reelection was stolen from him, stormed the Capitol and sent lawmakers fleeing for their lives. It was as horrific as it was predictable, given how Trump’s first impeachment had only emboldened his reckless behavior. Suddenly, Pelosi’s caucus was plunged into a second impeachment crisis.\n But if there were lessons to be taken from the first effort to oust Trump — about not pulling punches and leaving no investigative stone unturned — they were not applied to the second. Driven by their own outrage at what had happened inside the Capitol and a rapidly vanishing amount of time to hold Trump accountable, Democrats under Pelosi once again bulled forward at a breakneck tempo, leaving half the nation behind on the significance of what Trump had done and crippling their own effort to secure a conviction. But Pelosi was still hesitant.\n In a late-night, emergency Zoom meeting with her leadership team on Saturday, Jan. 9, Pelosi discussed whether a second effort to oust Trump was even necessary. She and her staff had shut down an effort by rank-and-file progressives to impeach the former president the very night of the riot. And since then, Pelosi had been trying to find an offramp, knowing full well that other Democratic leaders were concerned about a second effort delaying Biden’s agenda and nominations to fill his Cabinet. Pelosi had also personally asked Schiff to make the case against another impeachment to their colleagues. And despite his public claim to support another effort, the Intelligence leader did as Pelosi requested, arguing that Democrats should be on the same page as the new president — and that if they went after Trump in his waning days in office, it would look like they were just trying to keep him from running again.\n Yet during the Saturday call, even Pelosi’s advisers who had urged a more deliberate strategy during the first impeachment were now pressing for an accelerated process. After Schiff insisted Democrats “need to be looking forward,” Nadler pushed back hard. Trump’s actions, he argued, were so egregious they necessitated taking articles straight to the floor. Forget an investigation, Nadler continued. Forget a Judiciary Committee markup. They didn’t need to gather evidence and hold hearings. Lawmakers, he pointed out, had watched a crime unfold before their eyes.\n “Impeach him now,” Nadler argued. “They can give him due process in the Senate trial.”\n \n  \n It was a sharp departure from the principled stand the New York Democrat had taken during the first impeachment — and yet another sign that the ground beneath the speaker was once again shifting rapidly. Nadler had always been a stickler for doing impeachment the “right” way — not to mention fiercely territorial about protecting his committee’s jurisdiction and giving the president due process rights in the House.\n Of the four previous times in U.S. history that Congress had tried to impeach a president, only one had transpired without a full investigation and debate: the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. In 1868, lawmakers impeached Johnson in a fit of rage over a weekend when he replaced the secretary of war with a political crony. Only after that vote did the House draft articles, an effort so shoddily done that most impeachment experts rarely spoke of it. In fact, many influential scholars would come to view the entire exercise as congressional misuse of power. (Johnson was also narrowly acquitted by the Senate.)\n But on the leadership call that night, none of Pelosi’s deputies advocated for a go-slow process — most argued that speed in this case would be a virtue, not a weakness.\n “If Johnson could be hastily impeached for replacing a Cabinet secretary, we can charge Trump for inciting an armed rebellion against Congress,” Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) told the group.\n To the risk-averse speaker, reverting to impeachment by snap vote was a risky proposition. Could they really do this without a full impeachment process? Could they move forward without a committee report and evidentiary record? Again, seeing the writing on the wall, Pelosi caved. It was time to move, and move quickly, she told her team.\n “The Senate will do what the Senate will do,” Pelosi said firmly. “That’s not our concern.”\n A week after the riot, the House voted to impeach Trump for a second time.\n The strategies that Pelosi employed in both impeachments are sure to have long-term consequences for Hill oversight — and for future presidents. There is now precedent for half-baked impeachments that include a highly subjective and ad hoc standard of due process for an accused president, that does not include or require firsthand testimony, or any major attempt to persuade members of the other party or their voters. Worse, due to Pelosi’s decision not to fight for witnesses in court, some historians fear there is now a new model for unencumbered executive power, as presidents replicate Trump’s playbook for ignoring all Hill oversight and getting away with it, undermining checks and balances.\n \n  \n “Trump wanted to test the power of Congress,” said Naftali, the NYU professor. “Speaker Pelosi’s preferred strategy, however, left no time for Congress to counterattack and go to the courts to define for the future what a president’s constitutional obligation is to a Congress in an impeachment. And thus, left open the possibility that in the future, presidents will completely stonewall Congress.\n “It’s a very dangerous precedent,” he said, “and it’s a precedent because of the Democratic leadership’s decision in 2019 not to go to court to seek the information it should have under our Constitution in an impeachment inquiry.”\n Naftali, who has written books about the history of impeachment, has another fear: that impeachments after the Trump years will become merely an expression of partisan rage rather than a last resort to save the republic. Due to the shortcuts that have now been paved, there’s nothing stopping majorities in both parties from impeaching presidents on a whim and with little buy-in from the other side. Already Republicans are calling for their party to impeach Biden over a host of policy differences — an idea the nation’s founders debated and firmly rejected. And once that happens, Naftali warns, it will continue to occur over and over again.\n “I’m very worried that impeachment is going to be viewed as a way of rallying a base, making it completely political as opposed to a constitutional act.” Naftali warned. “Impeachment is there to protect the system; it’s not there to engage in a vendetta. What is happening now is a complete untethering of impeachment from its Constitutional origins.”\n Many Pelosi defenders will point to the Jan. 6 committee’s meticulous, no-holds-barred investigative work and conclude the caucus has done its job. But while the panel is summoning every witness from Trump’s inner circle, and fighting for — and even winning — court cases to enforce their subpoenas, critics of Pelosi’s strategy question if the crucial moment to persuade the public of Trump’s danger to the republic was squandered.\n “We look at what the Jan. 6 committee is accomplishing and say, ‘Gosh, if the Jan. 6 committee can do this, why couldn’t the House have done this?” Vladeck said. “We can’t know what would have happened if the Democrats had been more aggressive from the get-go. But it’s hard to imagine we’d be in a worse place.”","dc:creator":"Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/5c/e8/db510364413fa1b87eb59ee847f3/final-2000x1333.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Illustration by Sadie Lew","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Mag.Bade.Pelosi.OverrideImage","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/5c/e8/db510364413fa1b87eb59ee847f3/final-2000x1333.jpg"}}]},"content":"The groundbreaking speaker’s aversion to impeachment led her to short-circuit the oversight process.

So this is a brand new world, with Republicans openly advertising that they are prepping to hand Ukraine to Putin.”\n Murphy warned that the effect on Ukraine's planning “is potentially seismic,\" possibly forcing Zelenskyy's government “to start making decisions right now if they think that McCarthy and House Republicans are going to cut and run on them in January.”\n McCarthy’s posture on the issue reflects growing concerns about the stability of the Western alliance when it comes to supporting Ukraine and enforcing sanctions on Russia. Far-right leaders across Europe have signaled an uneasiness with maintaining the war effort, citing economic pain at home fueled in part by rising energy costs, a casualty of the U.S.-led sanctions targeting Moscow.\n Meanwhile, U.S. allies in eastern Europe are clinging to optimism — at least publicly — about the dynamics on Capitol Hill. Speaking in Washington this week, Estonia’s U.S. ambassador Kristjan Prikk said only that he has “been assured by different members of the Congress that there is a strong core support to continue the assistance to Ukraine as long as needed from both parties.”\n Alexander Ward contributed reporting.","dc:creator":"Andrew Desiderio and Jonathan Lemire","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/6f/51/db01544f4cc09d8b9f8c786557d1/truman-statue-capitol-10837.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Andrew Harnik/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi arrive to a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Building on Sept. 29, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/6f/51/db01544f4cc09d8b9f8c786557d1/truman-statue-capitol-10837.jpg"}}]},"content":"Republicans are poised for big midterm gains but increasingly at odds over approving more aid to Kyiv — which means a new calculus for Biden.","contentSnippet":"Republicans are poised for big midterm gains but increasingly at odds over approving more aid to Kyiv — which means a new calculus for Biden.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/19/white-house-gop-ukraine-war-funding-00062624","isoDate":"2022-10-19T23:05:38.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    The Rudest Things You Can Do As An Overnight Guest In Someone’s Home\n\n","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rudest-things-overnight-guest-home_l_6340408be4b03e8038c8ca7c","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 05:45:01 -0400","content:encoded":"\n\n    Etiquette experts share the faux pas to avoid while you're staying with a friend or family member.\n\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Etiquette experts share the faux pas to avoid while you're staying with a friend or family member.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/635058952600005a0051cd2c.jpeg?cache=iddogkcvhv&ops=224_126"},"comments":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rudest-things-overnight-guest-home_l_6340408be4b03e8038c8ca7c#comments","content":"\n\n    Etiquette experts share the faux pas to avoid while you're staying with a friend or family member.\n\n","contentSnippet":"Etiquette experts share the faux pas to avoid while you're staying with a friend or family member.","guid":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rudest-things-overnight-guest-home_l_6340408be4b03e8038c8ca7c","isoDate":"2022-10-20T09:45:01.000Z"},{"title":"Mortgage rates rise again, creeping closer to 7%","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/homes/mortgage-rates-october-20/index.html","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 14:47:10 GMT","content":"Mortgage rates rose again this week, stopping just short of the 7% mark.

New British Prime Minister Liz Truss believed she could cut taxes without taking into account the policy’s immediate effects on the market, or its actual overall cost. The result has been a full-fledged economic disaster. One might call it a free market reform that the market rejected. It’s a funny concept, but it’s not the first time such a thing has occurred.</p> <p>Indeed, the first attempt to liberalize an economy was based on the same idea: that liberalizing markets was all that it took for markets to function. In fact, it turned out, markets need much more tending and plenty of governmental care. The French found this out the hard way in the 18<sup>th</sup> century after new free-market reforms led to market failure, uprisings and famine — and perhaps even the first sparks of the French Revolution. The ensuing government reversal bears an eerie resemblance to Britain’s crisis today.</p> <p>In the 1760s, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot began a series of reforms to liberalize the French economy. Turgot was a famed French philosopher and high government administrator (known as a royal intendant) whose responsibilities were to manage the monarchy’s legal affairs, taxes and political questions in the provinces. A leader of Enlightenment thought, he believed in religious tolerance, the abolition of slavery, secular public schools, free speech and more democratic representation. Most of all, Turgot was influenced by the new French free-market school of thought called physiocracy, which held that all wealth came from farming (as opposed to commerce and industry), and that, therefore, landowners and farm laborers should be freed from taxes and regulations so that farming could prosper and produce capital investment for improvement and progress.</p> <p>Turgot was a visionary of economic liberalism. He wrote that the state should never opt to go “bankrupt” because it could take on debt or raise taxes. The most important reforms it could make were to cut spending and use better accounting to manage public finances. While there was growing interest in these ideas, France was still a feudal country dominated by landed aristocrats — who, by privilege, paid no taxes — and their peasant serfs, who paid high taxes to both the royal government and to their noble masters. The idea that fabulously rich nobles paid no taxes infuriated Turgot who wanted a fair, proportional tax system that favored economic growth and productivity by spurring the farming sector and consumer demand.</p> <p>At the center of France’s agrarian economy was the grain trade. Since the 1400s, rules were in place to make sure famines did not get out of control. That meant grain merchants were heavily regulated so that they could not make large profits. Turgot saw this as the fundamental problem of the economy. “It is an error,” he wrote, “to sacrifice the rights of owners just to alleviate a bit of the suffering of the poor by forcing a product to be sold under its value.”</p> <p>While France’s population began to explode in the 1720s, its agricultural production and industrial expansion didn’t keep up and wealth inequality became acute. Jobs and food were scarce. The country lived in fear of famine, and the crown guaranteed bread prices and distribution. By the mid-century, wages lagged and grain prices skyrocketed. Turgot saw the state’s control of the grain trade as a hindrance to economic growth. Like his contemporary Adam Smith, Turgot believed that capital and economic growth came solely from farming. Therefore, he thought, if the grain trade were free, then France’s economy would grow in turn. One of the first advocates of the term laissez-faire, he hoped that a rationalized taxation scheme would free “capitalist entrepreneurs” to invest in farming and fuel an economic expansion.</p> <p>In 1761, King Louis XV named Turgot intendant of the poor Limoges region. His orders were to reduce the misery of the population and spur the local economy. It was here that he would begin the first large-scale liberalization project with the hopes of spurring the grain trade. A fervent believer in lower, proportional taxes to ease pressures on poor peasant consumers, Turgot worked with top scientists to make a land survey to make taxes fairer.</p> <p>Crucially, Turgot at first came to think that before unleashing free markets, one had to first protect the poor from the immediate market shock of liberalization and that the state would have to step in to help those with no work and no food. In Limoges, he forced landowners to support the poor, and worked to end the feudal forced road-building labor of the <i>corvées</i> by developing a tax for building highways, which, in turn, he hoped would help facilitate grain transportation. He proposed establishing state-supported “Charity Offices and Workshops” to provide employment for the poor to do public works. Turgot even tried to import food to sustain his impoverished region to spur its growth so it could improve its grain production. He then employed his state powers to help found the now-famous Limoges porcelain industry, which still exists today. Turgot’s unorthodox and highly pragmatic mix of liberalizing and state intervention produced modest success.</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/24/8a/a5b566884986a2ef59ee339555ef/mag.Soll.TradeReform2.jpg\"> <br> <p>But as he crafted a theory to solve France’s economic woes, he still saw excessive state intervention over bread, the main staple of people’s diet, as the central problem. In times of poor harvest, the crown capped grain prices, kept emergency stores and facilitated grain distribution. Additionally, a number of powerful players — including the king’s brothers — made a fortune on tolls and various grain taxes. Turgot’s <i>Letters on the Liberty of the Grain Trade </i>(1770) was based on the simple equation that if the crown removed its caps, guarantees, protections and other tolls, the grain trade would prosper and the market would expand, thus bringing more profits to farmers and lower prices to consumers.</p> <p>Turgot got a chance to try his models on a larger scale when he became King Louis XVI’s Controller-General of Finance in 1774. Other royal ministers had tried to liberalize the grain trade before him without success, but he pressed ahead, and abolished grain subsidies, price controls, state storehouses and bread distribution systems for the poor.</p> <p>Turgot believed that his economic ideas had to be pushed through, no matter what the cost, and seemingly without recalling his previous insight of softening the blow of liberalization in Limoges. By the end of the summer of 1774, harvests were poor, but Turgot went forward anyway, sure that liberalization would be the answer to France’s grain shortages. In September, he signed a declaration completely freeing the grain trade. Believing in the force of liberalization, he had liquidated the state’s emergency grain reserves and had not made advance plans for poor relief. Almost immediately, there was grain price inflation, panic, speculation and shortages. Turgot tried to ease the pain by importing grain from Poland to keep supply working. He also liberalized more internal tolls to free circulation.</p> <p>Still, the results were catastrophic. </p> <p>Over the following months, with speculation, hoarding, inflation, bread shortages and famine, riots broke out across France. Bakers and grain merchants were attacked, and the houses of the rich were pillaged in some cities. The rioters came from the rural laboring classes but also were found among the common tradesmen who were now ruined due to grain prices.</p> <p>Turgot demanded a crackdown on the “brigand” rioters, and state agents arrested butchers, blacksmiths, wig masters and masons. Turgot became convinced that there was a conspiracy behind the uprising and subjected rioters to rough interrogations to find out who was behind the disturbances. He demanded that priests support the government by teaching “the sublime precepts of religion… that will assure the maintenance of order and justice.”</p> <p>The problem was resistance to Turgot’s reforms was not a matter of conspiracy or sheer obstinance; it was a market crisis. Rising grain prices and the collapse of the old state price controls, storehouses and distribution networks reduced the laborers, artisans, and humble merchants to starvation. One observer noted that the poor were “ashamed to beg,” but had nothing, so they rioted. As the crisis worsened in April of 1775, Turgot called for more charity workhouses. Yet it was impossible to get them up and running to counter the food crisis. Turgot called up an army of 25,000 soldiers to suppress the “brigands,” but uncontrollable inflation and shortages continued to spark organized resistance to the government.</p> <p>Chief among Turgot’s critics was the famous Italian diplomat, economist and wit, Ferdinando Galiani (better known as the abbé Galiani), a fixture in the Parisian salons. Galiani believed that society was too dependent on farming to simply leave it to the market. He warned that one bad harvest could ruin not only agriculture but the industrious towns that depended on food supplies. The whims of nature could deprive farmers of “all funds” to replant. Therefore, the state needed to regulate and oversee some of the market to keep it running, particularly in times of dearth. Nature, Galiani noted, did not respect even the finest philosophical ideas.</p> <p>Most worrisome for the crown was that the riots, known as the Flour Wars, were now morphing into an outright revolt. The constant pressure of famine and subsistence living created a vicious circle of regular, organized uprisings and growing political criticism. Turgot’s reforms had rallied large groups of opposition to the government. Indeed, Turgot’s enemies at court whispered in the king’s ear that his ministry was, in fact, trying to undermine royal power. On May 12, 1776, Louis XVI dismissed Turgot. His reforms were promptly reversed, but by then, the state had been seriously weakened. A powerful movement of opposition had arisen, which many historians believe provided the foundations for the uprising of the French Revolution.</p> <p>Turgot was a visionary. He was right that the grain markets would benefit from liberalization. And his early initiatives showed a viable path to reform: working carefully with civil society to create better market conditions, providing protections for the poor, supporting industrial development and building the market slowly. However, as time wore on, he became impatient and enamored with the belief that free market reform could trump the harder project of moving society slowly to a more liberal model. It ended in famine, collapse and revolt. Today, the markets themselves again show that, even as they cry out for liberalization, they also depend on good government and industrial strategy, balanced books and investments in society and people.<b> </b>Now as then, you can’t fill an empty stomach with ideology alone.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"World markets continue to reel from the British government’s free market reform fiasco.

a question. If her insistence on huge tax cuts doomed her, does that mean the era of the tax cut zombie is finally coming to an end?</p> <p>For years now, it has been clear that there’s no strong evidence that tax cuts fuel economic growth. But Republican politicians in the United States kept trying it anyway — it was the idea that wouldn’t die. One economist even wrote <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691154541/zombie-economics\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a book&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691154541/zombie-economics&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5116000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5116000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a book</a> on the matter called “Zombie Economics.”</p> <p>Liz Truss and her first Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, embraced the tax cut ideology and advertised it over the summer during the campaign for the leadership contest in the Tory Party. They won — so far so good — and they implemented the policy they had campaigned on. Almost immediately, the British economy was hammered with high interest rates and a plunge in the value of the pound. Truss’ poll numbers nosedived, and she quickly backed down. But this only made those who had voted for her wonder why they should still support her.

If her insistence on huge tax cuts doomed her, does that mean the era of the tax cut zombie is finally coming to an end?\n For years now, it has been clear that there’s no strong evidence that tax cuts fuel economic growth. But Republican politicians in the United States kept trying it anyway — it was the idea that wouldn’t die. One economist even wrote a book on the matter called “Zombie Economics.”\n Liz Truss and her first Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, embraced the tax cut ideology and advertised it over the summer during the campaign for the leadership contest in the Tory Party. They won — so far so good — and they implemented the policy they had campaigned on.

I need your help,” he’d been repeating all day. But Belgard wasn’t offering any as she criticized Democrats and President Joe Biden. Lawson countered that he steered millions of federal dollars to the area and made a vow: “I won’t give up on you for nothing.”</p> <p>“If you became a Republican, I’d vote for you all day long,” retorted Belgard.</p> <p>That exchange summed up Lawson’s fundamental problem: He’s a lifelong Democrat whose congressional district — a near- majority Black district — was dismantled by DeSantis this spring. The governor’s redistricting plan not only eliminated Lawson’s seat but also put the entire state capital, and Lawson’s Tallahassee home, in the district now held by GOP Rep. <a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/259506\" target=\"_blank\" data-person-id=\"259506\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666138402387,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666138402387,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\\&quot;identifier\\&quot;:\\&quot;259506\\&quot;,\\&quot;url\\&quot;:\\&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/259506\\&quot;,\\&quot;preferredName\\&quot;:\\&quot;Rep.

He said he told his colleagues in D.C. that “I want to know if I really am a member of the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.] You all haven’t given me anything.”</p> <p>“You guys could give me $25,000 and I’d be OK,” Lawson said in an interview.</p> <p>In this rare member-on-member matchup, Dunn has outraised Lawson more than two-to-one. Campaign filings show that Dunn has pulled in nearly $1.59 million, compared to the nearly $600,000 Lawson has collected.</p> <p>North Florida just a few years ago was home to conservative Democratic voters who would split their tickets between Republicans for president and hometown Democrats. But Trump’s ascent led to a “major realignment” of the region, said Matt Isbell, a Democratic analyst and data consultant. Calhoun County, the home of Blountstown where Lawson was campaigning, had twice as many Democrats as Republicans in 2016. Not anymore. Calhoun and several other counties in the region now have more GOP voters.</p> <p>“The window is rapidly closing,” Isbell said. “When I start tracking local party affiliation — this whole region — was blue.

Al Lawson on Saturday why she won’t be voting for him — or any other Democrat.\n “Our country is going down the tubes and the Democrats are not doing anything to help,” Margaret Belgard told the three-term Democratic congressman from nearby Tallahassee.\n Lawson, a 6-foot-7 former athlete trying to save his job after Gov. Ron DeSantis drew him out of his district, had been making the rounds among the food vendors and tents at the annual Goat Day festival in this small town near the Apalachicola River when he encountered Belgard.\n “I’m Al Lawson. I need your help,” he’d been repeating all day. But Belgard wasn’t offering any as she criticized Democrats and President Joe Biden. Lawson countered that he steered millions of federal dollars to the area and made a vow: “I won’t give up on you for nothing.”\n “If you became a Republican, I’d vote for you all day long,” retorted Belgard.\n That exchange summed up Lawson’s fundamental problem: He’s a lifelong Democrat whose congressional district — a near- majority Black district — was dismantled by DeSantis this spring. The governor’s redistricting plan not only eliminated Lawson’s seat but also put the entire state capital, and Lawson’s Tallahassee home, in the district now held by GOP Rep. Neal Dunn, who is from Panama City. It was a move designed to give Florida Republicans a 20-8 seat advantage over Democrats.\n \n \n Several voting and civil rights groups have filed legal challenges against DeSantis’ redistricting efforts in state and federal court but neither are expected to be resolved any time soon.\n Instead of retreating, or ending his political career, the 74-year-old Lawson blasted DeSantis’ involvement in redistricting and announced he would challenge Dunn even though the revamped district went for former President Donald Trump over Biden by 11 points in 2020.\n “I still had it in my blood,” explains Lawson, who noted that he represented many of the rural counties in the newly-formed congressional district during his 10-year career in the state Senate.\n Lawson, whose Republican colleagues in the Florida Legislature would joke with him about his never-ending quests to get money for a rural fire department, has staked part of his campaign on a throwback appeal that stressed how much state and federal money he’s secured for residents over the years.\n Despite pleas from his fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus, national Democrats have provided little funding for his campaign. He said he told his colleagues in D.C. that “I want to know if I really am a member of the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.] You all haven’t given me anything.”\n “You guys could give me $25,000 and I’d be OK,” Lawson said in an interview.\n In this rare member-on-member matchup, Dunn has outraised Lawson more than two-to-one. Campaign filings show that Dunn has pulled in nearly $1.59 million, compared to the nearly $600,000 Lawson has collected.\n North Florida just a few years ago was home to conservative Democratic voters who would split their tickets between Republicans for president and hometown Democrats. But Trump’s ascent led to a “major realignment” of the region, said Matt Isbell, a Democratic analyst and data consultant. Calhoun County, the home of Blountstown where Lawson was campaigning, had twice as many Democrats as Republicans in 2016. Not anymore. Calhoun and several other counties in the region now have more GOP voters.\n “The window is rapidly closing,” Isbell said. “When I start tracking local party affiliation — this whole region — was blue. Now there’s barely any of that left. … We’re rapidly hitting the point in north Florida where the only Democratic precincts outside of Tallahassee are African American.”\n Lawson’s 5th Congressional District linked Black communities across north Florida from west of Tallahassee to urban Jacksonville more than 160 miles east. It also included a large swath of Tallahassee and would have remained a Democratic-friendly seat in some of the initial maps drawn by legislators. But that all changed when DeSantis pushed the GOP-led Legislature to blow it up.\n \n \n It’s against this backdrop that Dunn and Lawson — who have known each other for decades — are now competing for the same seat, the only incumbent-on-incumbent congressional race in Florida. The contest has taken a rougher, partisan edge as Election Day draws closer, with both men airing ads slicing into their opponent.\n Dunn, who showed up at the Goat Day festival about a half hour after Lawson had left, pointed out that he had nothing to do with the DeSantis map that placed him in competition with Lawson.\n “I’m not running saying he’s a bad guy, I’m running saying that I’m a better fit for the district,” Dunn, who was first elected in 2016, said in an interview.\n Both men displayed those differences during a Tuesday lunchtime debate in Tallahassee before a local political club. Dunn and Lawson disagreed over abortion rights, guns, Biden’s presidency and the economy. Dunn called Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan “patently unconstitutional” while Lawson said it was “the right thing to do” to help students after Congress bailed out Wall Street.\n Dunn, using a familiar line for Republicans across the country, said that Lawson “votes with this president 100 percent of the time” while he represented “steadfast conservative values.”\n “I don’t worry about [Speaker] Nancy Pelosi or Biden. What I worry about is bringing resources down so that our community can survive,” Lawson retorted.\n \n \n Dunn’s line about Lawson’s voting record also shows up in one of the Republican’s television ads linking Lawson to Biden and Pelosi. Lawson, meanwhile, has hit Dunn for voting against a sweeping expansion of veterans health care that GOP Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott voted yes on.\n Dunn, a surgeon who spent 11 years in the U.S. Army and reached the rank of major, bristled over the criticism and defended his no vote during the debate by calling the bill “reckless” and too expensive.\n “There’s no way I would vote against veterans,” said Dunn, who was wearing a black U.S. Army baseball cap as he campaigned in Blountstown.\n Nancy Texeira, a longtime Lawson adviser who is working for a super PAC helping him, says bluntly that “we don’t expect any crossover” voters to back Lawson.

But if there was one Wheeling student who was firmly inoculated against Obama fever, it was Charlie Kirk, a lanky freshman already north of six feet who would go on to one day call America’s first Black president a “National Disgrace.”</p> <p>“If you were not wholeheartedly worshipping the guy you were considered like the worst human being ever,” Kirk would later explain, adding: “Well, that was me, and I found a lot of satisfaction in it.”</p> <p>In the years before Charlie Kirk would rocket to conservative stardom as the founder of Turning Point USA, the largest, wealthiest student group in the country, the frat-boy handsome fundraising savant who has made it his mission to make the GOP cool was a gangly kid his classmates described as “rude” and even friends referred to as “arrogant.” Like so many high school outsiders, he wouldn’t find his tribe until after graduation, when his youth and enthusiasm for conservative causes would ingratiate him with the gray-haired Republican donor set.<b>&nbsp;</b>His metamorphosis can be seen as a case study of the power of grievance politics and a reminder that resentment is an energizing fuel most potent when delivered by leaders who have felt it deeply themselves. It is also another sign of how much Obama’s optimism — so inspiring to so many — was also a deep threat to those who saw in it a future that would leave them behind.</p> <p>In 2009, many of the high schools that made up Chicago’s suburban collar were still quietly segregated learning communities that boasted mostly white parent associations and heavily endowed education funds that bankrolled luxurious upgrades to theater departments and school gyms. Not Wheeling. Sometimes referred to as “the ugly duckling,” it drew from a spattering of middle-class subdivisions, like the one Kirk’s father, Robert, a local architect, had designed and that Kirk’s family lived in. But it also pulled from modest blocks of low-hanging ranches and postage stamp-sized yards that housed the area’s growing Latino population, men and women who had arrived with families in tow but without papers, fleeing vicious drug wars in northern Mexico and Peru.</p> <p>Wheeling was a trailblazer, but not an outlier. By 2010, minorities made up more than a third of all suburban residents in the United States — shifting the political landscape. Once reliably Republican suburbs were increasingly voting blue, at least for a while. Obama took all the ones in Illinois in 2008 and almost all of them in 2012. And local school boards were increasingly preoccupied with the needs of students of color. By the early 2000s, Wheeling’s elementary schools needed so many Spanish-speaking teachers they were hiring them from Spain.<br></p> <br> <p>That September, as Kirk — a Reagan-obsessed 14-year-old who believed in small government, worried about the budget deficit and had a preternatural interest in trickle-down economics — was learning how to navigate Wheeling’s bustling hallways, Wheeling was doing its own adjusting. After years of demographic change, it had flipped — just a year earlier — from a mostly white school to a mostly Black, brown and Asian one. Kirk was a minority in his high school, outnumbered in classrooms, hallways<b>&nbsp;</b>and athletic fields by young people of color.</p> <p>This was the fast-changing universe young Kirk faced as he glinted toward adulthood and puzzled about what kind of man he would become. He was growing up in the backyard of a president he despised, during a time when the power structures and demographic makeup of his childhood home were forever changing, in a school where the status of a young white man was diminishing and in a nation where the power and pull of people of color were on the rise. America was changing. And the American suburbs were where a lot of that change was happening, as they increasingly welcomed a diverse crowd of young people seeking opportunity and advancement. Charlie Kirk would soon lead a movement that sought to stop at least some of them from reaching their goals.</p> <p>In later years, during conference speeches and chats with me, Kirk would profess a cheerful admiration for his school’s ethnic makeup and for the school as a whole. “Wheeling has been great to the Kirks,” he wrote in a post around the time of his younger sister’s graduation in 2014. But that benevolent telling would seem to contradict a harsher view Kirk would later hold about some immigrants in America. One high school friend described those views like this: There are good ones; they are documented and pay taxes. And there are bad ones. Kirk would later refer to the latter as “trespassing foreign nationals.” If there is a racism that preoccupies Kirk, that seemingly motivates and enrages him, it is what he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1519720775871127552\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;openly perceives &quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1519720775871127552&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51210000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51210001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">openly perceives</a>as deep-seated racism against white people like him.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/74/2d/058550a2406180dd8d0f2d8880fb/ap21293166393132.jpeg\"> <br> <p>It was at Wheeling High School where Kirk began to craft a political identity, poking at liberal teachers with whom he disagreed, dismissing some as “post-modern neo-Marxists.” He spoke up often in class, defending his then favorite economist Milton Friedman and promoting gun rights, once asking a teacher if guns make people violent, “do forks make people fat?” During his freshman year, he was seen by at least one classmate as an eccentric loudmouth with poor social skills. A lot of people found Kirk amusing, the classmate said. “Here’s this crazy political guy. He’ll never get anywhere.”</p> <p>In class, other students said Kirk was often rude, making the atmosphere unsettling. Despite his later assertions that liberals are condescending and intolerant of dissent, classmates said that it was Kirk who had “a superiority complex” and did not tolerate disagreement on issues he cared about. Even rare friends like Maria Krutikova, then a conservative and one of Kirk’s earliest political allies, says Kirk could be arrogant during these early years. And he didn’t always act in ethical ways, she says.</p> <p>Their senior year, when they were building SOS Liberty, the conservative youth group that would precede Turning Point USA, she says Kirk used her Facebook password and started joining conservative women’s Facebook groups around the country, posing as her so he could then invite them to SOS Liberty’s page and publicize the group. At the time, she shrugged it off, chalking it up to his passion for the cause. But in retrospect, she thinks it was weird. She recalls that, toward the end of senior year, he advised her to throw some classmates under the bus when she got in trouble for posting a silly lewd comment on a classroom chat board. She did not take the advice and was surprised by it, particularly since Kirk was already a self-proclaimed Christian. <i>That’s not very Christian of you</i>, she recalls thinking. (Kirk did not respond to requests for comment about statements that friends and former classmates have made about him.)</p> <p>In front of audiences, Kirk frequently gives the impression that he was a hardworking high schooler with a decent shot of getting into an elite American college.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(He ended up forgoing college altogether, after being rejected by West Point.) His classmates remember him differently. It’s unclear what types of grades Kirk actually received in high school, but he once told his chemistry teacher that he did not believe in homework. As far as sports, he was captain of the varsity basketball and football teams, praised for his free throw shot and considered one of the basketball team’s stars. But neither of those teams was very good.</p> <p>When it came to extracurriculars, Kirk did excel as an Eagle Scout, spending part of his senior year building a wheelchair ramp for an elderly neighbor. He prominently displayed the almost finished ramp on his Facebook page. Yet being an Eagle Scout, his classmates said, was considered a relatively low-status extracurricular activity at a school with an award-winning speech and debate team and a talented jazz program that traveled around the country.</p> <p>Kirk wasn’t the most accomplished student, but that did not deter him. He believed in himself. Soon, he would be on the precipice of stardom.<br></p> <br> <p><b>On June 5, 2012,</b> two days after graduating high school, Kirk used his $1,800 pool of graduation money to launch Turning Point USA. At the time it was called The Turning Point.</p> <p>Kirk has mythologized this origin story. But in public tellings, he has left out a key detail that paints him in a less heroic light and suggests that even at the end of high school, he still struggled to get along with his peers, even those who shared his political views. As he was planning his new group, he was still affiliated with SOS Liberty. And on the same day he launched The Turning Point, Kirk posted an embittered resignation letter on SOS Liberty’s Facebook page, alluding to disagreements group members were having with him. Kirk accused them of “planning behind my back.” He announced he was going out on his own and invited anyone who wanted to join his new group under his leadership. “I will take the same passion and drive I have and create a bigger, better, smarter, more effective group,” he wrote.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/8c/c8/08858c3c4a58bcc543cfb745b298/secondary4.charlie.kirk.jpg\"> <br> <p>Kirk did eventually go out and do that. But at least at first, his most important allies and friends were not other teens. They were donors, many in their 70s and 80s, who were also his financial supporters. He had met them on the Tea Party circuit, in hotel ballrooms and country club meeting halls, at fundraisers for local politicians and suburban gatherings where he often jumped up, nervously, at first, in an oversized suit and tie to say a few words about the country’s future and his desire to corral young Americans to the GOP.</p> <p>At first, even for them, Kirk didn’t read as all that suave. In the beginning — according to Joe Walsh, then an Illinois Republican congressman who eventually had a falling out with Kirk and became a vocal Never Trumper — a lot of aging GOP donors thought Kirk seemed like a dork. Walsh says he was “a beanpole of a kid” with an awkward facial tic. Still, there was something about him they started to like. Kirk grew on you. You’d take him out for dinner and he’d devour the food like he hadn’t eaten in weeks. You’d give him advice on what to watch and he’d watch it. You’d invite him to an event and he’d come. A lot of people in Chicago conservative circles who met Kirk back then became eager to help a kid with boundless energy who supported the larger cause of saving America from Obama-ism. Eventually, they began to think that Charlie Kirk was in fact cool. And they wanted to hang with him. Kirk had finally found his clique: Old guys with money.</p> <p>Kirk loved the scene. Hobnobbing with the rich agreed with him. The two biggest events, at the time, were CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference held every year at the end of February, and Restoration Weekend, a gathering of policy wonks, donors and up-and-comers who gathered every November to plot America’s future.</p> <p>But in between these events, there was a lot of socializing for him and a band of other energetic conservative supplicants looking to raise money for their groups. All aimed to rub shoulders with donors at every possible opportunity. They knew where to go. Palm Beach was hot during the winter season. Manhattan was hot all the time. (Kirk would tell a friend that $10,000 was like lunch money for the average donor there, thanks to the high cost of living.) Wyoming was hopping with deep-pocketed hunters at the height of elk season from September to December.</p> <p>Kirk likes to tell the story of his first encounter with Foster Friess, the politically incorrect born-again Christian who once told a TV reporter that women could avoid getting pregnant by holding aspirin between their knees, thus keeping their legs closed. Before arriving at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Florida where he met Friess, Kirk memorized the names and faces of the nation’s top far-right backers. He was a guy who was now doing his homework. He would bump into Friess in a stairwell and Friess would eventually cut Kirk his first big check. But there were a lot of others. Kirk’s early fans included a suburban jeweler, a pavement magnate and local Tea Party activists.<br></p> <br> <p>As time went on and Kirk’s star rose, his roster of supporters began to look more impressive. Eventually, he befriended a politically plugged-in Palm Beach couple, Lee and Allie Hanley. The Hanleys weren’t like some of his earlier supporters who wore athleisure-wear golf shirts and were sometimes gruff. They were an always exquisitely dressed Greenwich, Conn., couple who summered on Fishers Island, the ultra-exclusive WASP enclave off the Connecticut coast, and wintered in Palm Beach at a Mediterranean-style home designed by the iconic architect Maurice Fatio. Lee, the heir to a brick and petroleum fortune, was a Yale alum and track and field star.</p> <p>Charlie Kirk became a familiar face around their Palm Beach neighborhood where, on verandas and oceanside patios during the October to May “social season,” he and other fundraisers arrived in a steady stream, and millions of dollars were promised to conservative candidates and causes.</p> <p>With Allie’s influence rubbing off on him and a new stylish wardrobe, Kirk got the “makeover” he needed, Walsh recalls. He replaced his outdated suits with expensive-looking sports coats, which he paired with starched white oxfords and cool streetwear sneakers or leather lace-ups the color of desert sand. Soon, he would don hip-patterned socks and sport a voguish hairdo. His tic waned and the Chicago twang dissipated.</p> <p>It wouldn’t be long before the Reagan-loving kid from suburban Chicago wasn’t just hitting up the rich for cash. He was hanging with them at their sprawling vacation homes, hunting and fishing with them, attending their lavish birthday celebrations, and having God chat with them on their boats. One fundraising executive, almost twice Kirk’s age, recalls arriving at a donor’s beach house for a meeting and noticing Kirk pacing in the backyard on his cell. He was there as a houseguest. Kirk would soon also be included in important strategy sessions with conservative powerbrokers desperate to overcome Obama-ism and take back Washington in 2016. These would happen in plush living rooms with expensive pieces of period furniture and museum-grade art, far from the McMansion-dotted suburbs where Kirk had grown up.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/f5/e6/98c15e8b4bbc8257798ed64fdcfd/ap19355832028870-1.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Around that time, Lee and Allie Hanley would host a candlelit dinner for Turning Point USA at their Palm Beach home. Kirk, like a teenage son who’d invited the gang home, ended up bringing along a bigger crowd than expected. Allie, who was accustomed to chairing million-dollar benefits, quickly arranged for more place settings, then told the room they would not be getting the portions they normally would, according to two people who were there. Allie, they said, carried herself like the veteran hostess she was — thrown off her guard for a second, but quickly recovering her composure. The party must go on. And anyway, Kirk was just a big puppy dog — it was hard to get too mad at the kid, especially since he was being carefully groomed to take the low-taxes, small-government ideas the Hanleys and their peers held dear and pitch them to the next generation of voters.</p> <p>As Turning Point USA grew, Kirk needed young people to see his brand of conservatism as cool. Much like Reagan, who seemed to always radiate an infectious optimism, Kirk exuded a can-do-ism that his supporters saw as refreshing and empowering. Donors wanted to be around this energetic spitfire, seeing in him a fighting future they could get behind.</p> <p>Still, among other conservative wunderkinds, jealousy abounded. Leaders at other conservative groups grumbled that Kirk was more style than substance, selling a vision rather than creating one. They were doing the hard, behind-the-scenes work while he got the glamour — hanging out at the White House, chatting up President Trump, citing Don Jr. as one of his BFFs — and they resented it. But you couldn’t argue with the dollars. Kirk knew how to get the cash. By 2020, his organization would rake in $55 million, and the awkward boy from suburban Chicago would be one of the most admired, hated and feared young men in GOP politics — all before the age of 30.</p> <p><i>From the book </i><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/raising-them-right-kyle-spencer?variant=39969485520930\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666232896632,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666232896632,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/raising-them-right-kyle-spencer?variant=39969485520930&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f338-de4e-abcb-f7bd10d20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;RAISING THEM RIGHT&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f338-de4e-abcb-f7bd10d20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">RAISING THEM RIGHT</a><i> by Kyle Spencer.

But if there was one Wheeling student who was firmly inoculated against Obama fever, it was Charlie Kirk, a lanky freshman already north of six feet who would go on to one day call America’s first Black president a “National Disgrace.”\n “If you were not wholeheartedly worshipping the guy you were considered like the worst human being ever,” Kirk would later explain, adding: “Well, that was me, and I found a lot of satisfaction in it.”\n In the years before Charlie Kirk would rocket to conservative stardom as the founder of Turning Point USA, the largest, wealthiest student group in the country, the frat-boy handsome fundraising savant who has made it his mission to make the GOP cool was a gangly kid his classmates described as “rude” and even friends referred to as “arrogant.” Like so many high school outsiders, he wouldn’t find his tribe until after graduation, when his youth and enthusiasm for conservative causes would ingratiate him with the gray-haired Republican donor set. His metamorphosis can be seen as a case study of the power of grievance politics and a reminder that resentment is an energizing fuel most potent when delivered by leaders who have felt it deeply themselves. It is also another sign of how much Obama’s optimism — so inspiring to so many — was also a deep threat to those who saw in it a future that would leave them behind.\n In 2009, many of the high schools that made up Chicago’s suburban collar were still quietly segregated learning communities that boasted mostly white parent associations and heavily endowed education funds that bankrolled luxurious upgrades to theater departments and school gyms. Not Wheeling. Sometimes referred to as “the ugly duckling,” it drew from a spattering of middle-class subdivisions, like the one Kirk’s father, Robert, a local architect, had designed and that Kirk’s family lived in. But it also pulled from modest blocks of low-hanging ranches and postage stamp-sized yards that housed the area’s growing Latino population, men and women who had arrived with families in tow but without papers, fleeing vicious drug wars in northern Mexico and Peru.\n Wheeling was a trailblazer, but not an outlier. By 2010, minorities made up more than a third of all suburban residents in the United States — shifting the political landscape. Once reliably Republican suburbs were increasingly voting blue, at least for a while. Obama took all the ones in Illinois in 2008 and almost all of them in 2012. And local school boards were increasingly preoccupied with the needs of students of color. By the early 2000s, Wheeling’s elementary schools needed so many Spanish-speaking teachers they were hiring them from Spain.\n \n That September, as Kirk — a Reagan-obsessed 14-year-old who believed in small government, worried about the budget deficit and had a preternatural interest in trickle-down economics — was learning how to navigate Wheeling’s bustling hallways, Wheeling was doing its own adjusting. After years of demographic change, it had flipped — just a year earlier — from a mostly white school to a mostly Black, brown and Asian one. Kirk was a minority in his high school, outnumbered in classrooms, hallways and athletic fields by young people of color.\n This was the fast-changing universe young Kirk faced as he glinted toward adulthood and puzzled about what kind of man he would become. He was growing up in the backyard of a president he despised, during a time when the power structures and demographic makeup of his childhood home were forever changing, in a school where the status of a young white man was diminishing and in a nation where the power and pull of people of color were on the rise. America was changing. And the American suburbs were where a lot of that change was happening, as they increasingly welcomed a diverse crowd of young people seeking opportunity and advancement. Charlie Kirk would soon lead a movement that sought to stop at least some of them from reaching their goals.\n In later years, during conference speeches and chats with me, Kirk would profess a cheerful admiration for his school’s ethnic makeup and for the school as a whole. “Wheeling has been great to the Kirks,” he wrote in a post around the time of his younger sister’s graduation in 2014. But that benevolent telling would seem to contradict a harsher view Kirk would later hold about some immigrants in America. One high school friend described those views like this: There are good ones; they are documented and pay taxes. And there are bad ones. Kirk would later refer to the latter as “trespassing foreign nationals.” If there is a racism that preoccupies Kirk, that seemingly motivates and enrages him, it is what he openly perceivesas deep-seated racism against white people like him.\n \n  \n It was at Wheeling High School where Kirk began to craft a political identity, poking at liberal teachers with whom he disagreed, dismissing some as “post-modern neo-Marxists.” He spoke up often in class, defending his then favorite economist Milton Friedman and promoting gun rights, once asking a teacher if guns make people violent, “do forks make people fat?” During his freshman year, he was seen by at least one classmate as an eccentric loudmouth with poor social skills. A lot of people found Kirk amusing, the classmate said. “Here’s this crazy political guy. He’ll never get anywhere.”\n In class, other students said Kirk was often rude, making the atmosphere unsettling. Despite his later assertions that liberals are condescending and intolerant of dissent, classmates said that it was Kirk who had “a superiority complex” and did not tolerate disagreement on issues he cared about. Even rare friends like Maria Krutikova, then a conservative and one of Kirk’s earliest political allies, says Kirk could be arrogant during these early years. And he didn’t always act in ethical ways, she says.\n Their senior year, when they were building SOS Liberty, the conservative youth group that would precede Turning Point USA, she says Kirk used her Facebook password and started joining conservative women’s Facebook groups around the country, posing as her so he could then invite them to SOS Liberty’s page and publicize the group. At the time, she shrugged it off, chalking it up to his passion for the cause. But in retrospect, she thinks it was weird. She recalls that, toward the end of senior year, he advised her to throw some classmates under the bus when she got in trouble for posting a silly lewd comment on a classroom chat board. She did not take the advice and was surprised by it, particularly since Kirk was already a self-proclaimed Christian. That’s not very Christian of you, she recalls thinking. (Kirk did not respond to requests for comment about statements that friends and former classmates have made about him.)\n In front of audiences, Kirk frequently gives the impression that he was a hardworking high schooler with a decent shot of getting into an elite American college. (He ended up forgoing college altogether, after being rejected by West Point.) His classmates remember him differently. It’s unclear what types of grades Kirk actually received in high school, but he once told his chemistry teacher that he did not believe in homework. As far as sports, he was captain of the varsity basketball and football teams, praised for his free throw shot and considered one of the basketball team’s stars.

Vance thinks it's time for Republicans to have another fight over a southern border wall, this time with President Joe Biden.\n If the GOP seizes full control of Congress in the midterms, the Ohio Republican said the party should use its majorities to extract border wall money from the Biden administration as a condition of funding portions of the government. Vance said that advancing border wall cash is one of his top two priorities should he defeat Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) in November, and he urged the GOP to join him in fighting for an expanded barrier between the United States and Mexico. \n “Republicans, we need to have a fight over the border wall. And we need to be willing to say to Joe Biden: ‘You don't get another dime for your priorities unless you do your job and enforce and secure the Southern border,’” Vance told supporters here in his hometown.\n Vance’s comments show how a GOP House and Senate would wage new, if familiar, fiscal battles with the Democratic president over the next two years. As he seeks to beat back Ryan in their close race to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Vance is making border security a key pillar of his campaign, alongside stopping inflation and increasing domestic energy production.\n Republicans need to pick up just one Democratic seat to take the Senate majority, provided they hold on to GOP territory in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina. And if they do, things could get nasty when it comes to funding the government.\n If elected, Vance says he would push for $3 billion to secure the barrier and finish portions of the incomplete southern border wall.

It's a sign that the race remains close enough to not take chances and a far cry from where things stood in Ohio at this time six years ago.<br></p> <br> <p>Last time this seat was in play, Portman had dispatched Gov. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) already. It's escaped no one's notice that Ryan is overperforming, despite a midterm cycle that's working against him.</p> <p>“Tim Ryan has forced national Republicans to spend roughly $40 million in a general election in a state that they had no plans to spend in,” said Justin Barasky, who managed Brown’s winning 2018 reelection bid. “He is going to be responsible, one way or the other, for helping Democrats hold the Senate. Win or lose.”</p> <p>Ryan's doing it by peppering his candid rhetoric with mild expletives and not emphasizing that he’s a Democrat. In a state Donald Trump won by 8 points, Ryan must claim a significant slice of Republican voters to prevail. It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that his campaign bus is bright red.</p> <p>The Buckeye State's progressive senior senator agreed that Ryan is lifting Senate Democrats nationwide but pointedly added that “my interest is that he wins and has done that service. Not that he loses and has done that service.”</p> <p>“I would make one prediction. Maybe I shouldn't,” Brown said in an interview. “But a year from now, J.D. Vance will be living back in California.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4c/16/e7843dec4f0d8f68bfc883422eb5/img-8797-edit.jpg\"> <br> <p>The close race is getting more intense as Election Day nears. Vance dubs Ryan a “total scumbag” and a “fake moderate.” Ryan calls Vance “lazy as can be” and barely tolerates him: “I don’t hate him. I don’t respect him.”</p> <p>Vance is professorial on the stump but shows a hard edge as he rails against the media, and he too adds a swear here and there.

Even if he doesn’t win.\n The self-described Democratic “underdog” is neck-and-neck with J.D. Vance in the race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). And Ryan’s doing it without the help of the national party while forcing Republican groups to spend more than $30 million countering him rather than on Democratic-held seats in places like Arizona and Colorado.\n While Ryan absorbs Republican attacks, Democrats are mostly focused elsewhere — a boost to their broader effort to hold the 50-50 Senate against midterm headwinds that leaves the 10-term congressman essentially on his own. Democrats love Ryan for keeping it close, yet as Vance keeps a slim lead in public polls, Ryan isn’t favored by … pretty much anyone except himself.\n The blunt, staccato-voiced 49-year-old insists he’ll surprise everyone and join Sen. Sherrod Brown as the only Democrats to win Senate races here since former Sen. John Glenn won his last race in 1992. Democrats think he has an outside chance at winning, according to interviews with congressional lawmakers and party strategists.\n \n \n \nIf he can pull it off, Ryan says he’ll operate outside of his party leadership when necessary — contrary to the Pelosi-loving image Republicans are pushing, citing his recently reliable Democratic voting record.\n “I don’t know if I’m going to vote for Chuck Schumer” as leader, Ryan said in an interview on his campaign bus. “I will get to the Senate and be beholden to absolutely nobody, right? And I will be, probably, a royal pain in the ass when I get there. And that may be a reason why we're not getting help.”\n Should he lose but help keep the Senate in Democratic control by diverting national GOP resources, he allowed that he’ll “be glad that the inmates aren’t taking over the asylum. But you know, I won't be happy. That's just not in my DNA.”\n Republicans now project confidence about Vance, but the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC is spending about $3 million per week to boost Ryan's foe and has kept its ad reservations. It's a sign that the race remains close enough to not take chances and a far cry from where things stood in Ohio at this time six years ago.\n \n Last time this seat was in play, Portman had dispatched Gov. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) already. It's escaped no one's notice that Ryan is overperforming, despite a midterm cycle that's working against him.\n “Tim Ryan has forced national Republicans to spend roughly $40 million in a general election in a state that they had no plans to spend in,” said Justin Barasky, who managed Brown’s winning 2018 reelection bid. “He is going to be responsible, one way or the other, for helping Democrats hold the Senate. Win or lose.”\n Ryan's doing it by peppering his candid rhetoric with mild expletives and not emphasizing that he’s a Democrat. In a state Donald Trump won by 8 points, Ryan must claim a significant slice of Republican voters to prevail. It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that his campaign bus is bright red.\n The Buckeye State's progressive senior senator agreed that Ryan is lifting Senate Democrats nationwide but pointedly added that “my interest is that he wins and has done that service. Not that he loses and has done that service.”\n “I would make one prediction. Maybe I shouldn't,” Brown said in an interview. “But a year from now, J.D. Vance will be living back in California.”\n \n  \n The close race is getting more intense as Election Day nears. Vance dubs Ryan a “total scumbag” and a “fake moderate.” Ryan calls Vance “lazy as can be” and barely tolerates him: “I don’t hate him. I don’t respect him.”\n Vance is professorial on the stump but shows a hard edge as he rails against the media, and he too adds a swear here and there. He does press gaggles, but his campaign did not make him available for an interview. Ryan clearly enjoys back-and-forth with reporters more; a planned 10-minute interview ends up at 25 minutes as he pushes more middle-class tax cuts and vows to steer his party in a new direction.\n Ryan's biggest strength may prove his exploitation of internal GOP divisions after Vance’s primary win. Those splits dried up fundraising and curbed enthusiasm for Vance among Republican voters who supported other candidates as Ryan railed against China on TV.\n “He spent his money running as a conservative Democrat while the Republicans were beating each other up,” Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio) said of how Ryan kept the race close. “His ads, I mean, they’re very populist. I wouldn’t even say middle of the road. They’re right-leaning.”\n Democrats disagree that Ryan is running as a quasi-Republican. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said his campaign is “close to the winning message of Sherrod Brown.”\n The GOP's betting that Ryan will shed cross-aisle support as Vance and the GOP super PAC focus tightly on his recent voting record in support of Democrats’ agenda. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Vance spent the summer running as a “Trump Republican” but the ground shifted this fall and Vance is “beginning to pull away.”\n \n Democrats wonder whether the Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC could change that with an ad barrage. At this moment, Ryan’s lonely battle is a point of pride as he posts big fundraising numbers, advises big-name surrogates like former President Barack Obama to stay away and revels in being the “face of this campaign.”\n “We don't necessarily need them to come in here,\" Ryan said. \"We're raising enough money to do this on our own.\"\n Still, some Ohio Democrats feel snubbed.

He may well return to that dynamic next year in a GOP-controlled House.\n The eight-term Ohio Republican is on the brink of leadership-blessed power in a Republican majority, set to wield the Judiciary Committee’s powerful mallet should the GOP flip the House in November, as is likely. Jordan’s ascension will mark a new pinnacle not only for himself but for the pro-Trump Freedom Caucus — empowering its last original co-founder still in Congress to handle impeachments, immigration and more.\n That perch will give him new chances to wage bare-knuckle political combat against Democrats, with the Biden White House already preparing aggressive pushback to nascent House Republican investigations. But it will also give Jordan an opening to embrace his old-school Freedom Caucus self by choosing issues where his cachet with conservative and younger members paired with an off-the-Hill influence can help him move the party in his more Trumpian direction.\n And that influence is real: Interviews with nearly a dozen lawmakers underscore that while other House GOP leaders may run afoul of the party’s base, Jordan continues to wield unparalleled sway within it. His cred within the Trump world and conservative media give him tools to — when and if he wants — undercut the leadership colleagues who’ve elevated him as he backed them from the minority.\n \n \n In an interview with POLITICO, Jordan suggested that he's not afraid to use his influence to push his own fellow Republicans, sketching out where he wants to see change in a GOP-controlled House.\n Jordan mapped out “four big moments” in 2023 where he sees opportunities for Republicans to legislatively fight the political riptide (namely, a Democratic White House and possibly Senate) that's likely to wash away much of their recently rolled-out Commitment to America agenda: the debt ceiling, surveillance reform, funding the government and the farm bill.\n “The old line is, the guy who takes you to the Super Bowl gets to coach the game,\" Jordan said.\"So I think if we win, I think [Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy] is going to be the speaker. Then it's important we do what we said we were gonna do, and do what the American people elected us to do.\"\n Each of the four areas Jordan outlined for Republicans to dig in on could also spotlight divisions among them. The House GOP has balked at this Congress' Mitch McConnell-negotiated deals on the debt ceiling and government funding; a partially Trump-fueled schism helped sink surveillance proposals in 2020; and under then-Speaker Paul Ryan, conservatives helped take down a farm bill in 2018.\n \n  \n So if Jordan's invocation of those four topics gives leadership any heartburn, it's not without precedent. Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.), an ally of the Ohioan, pointed to the dichotomy he embodies by describing Jordan as an “enthusiastic supporter” of McCarthy and someone who will “be helpful in holding the conference’s feet to the fire.”\n “I think he is the change agent,” Bishop said, summing up Jordan’s mantra as de-emphasizing \"antagonism with leadership” while helping “facilitate positive change.” Then Bishop attached a leadership-sized warning shot: “Half measures or business as usual are not going to be acceptable.”\n Jordan, first elected in 2006, is no stranger to antagonizing leaders of both parties. He co-founded the House Freedom Caucus in 2015, got labeled a “legislative terrorist” by John Boehner, one of the two GOP speakers he helped run off, and later unsuccessfully challenged McCarthy for minority leader. Since then, he's become more of an inside-the-tent player as the conference shifts his way, helping lead the GOP defense against Trump’s two impeachments and the Jan. 6 select committee.\n “I do think that’s where Jim has been making his presence known and impacting the overall direction of the conference,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas).\n That approach has left Democrats all but ready to throw salt over their shoulder when Jordan draws near, viewing him as the quintessential Donald Trump acolyte. Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked him from the Jan. 6 committee, and Democrats have contrasted his treatment of Trump probes with his actions during the Benghazi probe to allege that he spreads misinformation.\n Democrats see Jordan’s remarks at CPAC earlier this year — where he said that GOP investigations would help “frame up the 2024 race” and that Republicans “need to make sure that [Trump] wins” another term — as indicative of how he would run the committee.\n “Jim sort of had several roles: You know, point man for spreading right wing poison. You know, cheap underminer of prominent Democrats, character assassin,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who is running to lead Democrats on the Oversight Committee next year.\n \"Those are his skill sets that he would bring to whatever the status of the Republicans is in the new Congress,\" Connolly added. \"But legislating, working across the aisle, are not among those skills.\"\n They’ll have plenty of chances to clash again. Jordan is poised to lead Republicans into some of the next Congress' most politically divisive investigations — particularly a broad look at the Justice Department and FBI that will sweep in the search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, possibly getting paired with a bid to curtail DOJ and the FBI through government funding bills.\n Bishop predicted that Jordan would want to make “serious reforms” to both agencies, including looking at “structural change” to the FBI.\n And GOP leaders are giving Jordan a leading role in potential impeachments next Congress, a lane that's laden with potholes. Democrats are gearing up to decry any of Jordan's moves as overreach and revenge politics after two Trump impeachments, and not all of his GOP colleagues are on board yet.\n Jordan, and many on his committee, already have one possible impeachment target in Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Judiciary Republicans are already in talks over what to do about Mayorkas' handling of the southern border, Jordan said. Meanwhile, Democrats are preemptively bristling over the idea, arguing that it is unprecedented and shows the GOP isn’t serious about addressing immigration.\n Importantly, with the midterms still three weeks away, Jordan and McCarthy are still gliding along in a relationship that Republicans credit with bringing the conference’s often-fractious right flank deeper into the fold. The two are actively engaged on future strategy, and coordinating with Oversight chair-in-waiting Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) on GOP investigations.\n \"They’ll be a good influence for the whole conference,\" said Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.), a member of House leadership who sits on the Judiciary panel. \"I think Kevin really respects Jim's voice and the respect that he has from his colleagues. And so I think he'll put a lot of weight into what he says and thinks.”\n Jordan praised McCarthy for having “given opportunities” to Freedom Caucus members and engaged “more of the spectrum of the conference,\" predicting that “you'll see more of that” next year.\n That isn’t to say everyone is sold. Using a football analogy, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) compared the likelihood that McCarthy will formally outrank Jordan next year to “watching Tom Brady sit on the bench, while Drew Bledsoe mismanages the offense.”\n And Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a former Freedom Caucus chair, noted that the dynamics that influence Jordan's bond with his leaders will look different in the majority, where McCarthy will need to wrangle a conference that tries divided government with the Biden administration.\n \"I'm always a big believer that when you're in the minority, it's easier to be conservative than when you're in the majority,\" Biggs said. \"We'll have to see how it is going forward.”\n Olivia Beavers and Caitlin Emma contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Jordain Carney","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/46/62/d0f4df154c588d59ca78163a869d/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1243312465"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Jeff Swensen/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Jim Jordan mapped out “four big moments” in 2023 where he sees opportunities for Republicans to legislatively fight the political riptide.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/46/62/d0f4df154c588d59ca78163a869d/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1243312465"}}]},"content":"The only still-serving original House Freedom Caucus co-founder is potentially weeks from ascension to a powerful gavel.

The NFL may actually be moving in the direction of forcing Snyder to sell. There is a precedent for an owner losing his team amid harsh scrutiny. In 2017, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson divested himself of the team after the league launched an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/18/facing-misconduct-investigation-panthers-owner-selling-team.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;investigation&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/18/facing-misconduct-investigation-panthers-owner-selling-team.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51270006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51270007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">investigation</a> over sexual misconduct allegations and use of racist language.</p> <p>“I think America, the world, expects us to, as leaders,” Irsay told the press, emphasizing the NFL’s duty to uphold the values it publicly subscribes to. The NFL’s apparent willingness to discipline its wayward kin finds no companion inclination in the Republican Party. Immediately following the Jan. 6 riots, many Republicans sounded like they were done with Trump. But he was not done with them, and soon GOP lawmakers were spotted traveling to Mar-a-Lago to eat Cheetos from his palm and do his bidding. Trump’s demagoguery has soiled the Republican image as much as Snyder’s junky home field (the embarrassment of the league); meanwhile, his team’s abysmal play and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/17/empty-seats-and-scandals-it-appears-no-one-wants-to-be-a-washington-fan\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;dwindling attendance&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/17/empty-seats-and-scandals-it-appears-no-one-wants-to-be-a-washington-fan&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51270008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf51270009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">dwindling attendance</a> have corroded the NFL brand. At least the NFL might be doing something about this human embarrassment. (Of course, it’s also quite possible the owners will back off just like their Republican counterparts; if they oust Snyder, the thinking goes, they may be risking their own survival if they slip up down the line. And a high bar must be cleared to remove Snyder: 24 of the league’s 32 owners must vote for his ouster. Ultimately, there may be more Mitch McConnells than Liz Cheneys in the NFL.)</p> <p>Snyder could go quietly, but who expects that? The only thing he does quietly is lose.

Rather than surrender, Snyder would likely ignite his retrorocket for a Trumpian orbit of endless lawsuits. And if he really has the explosive dirt on the NFL and its owners that he alleges to have, who would be surprised at him bombing the league he was forced to leave, just as Trump seems happy to destroy the presidency if he can’t have it.</p> <p>Like Trump, Snyder isn’t the type to bow, no matter what ill his intransigency spreads. Both men lead storied institutions that have seen much better times. Aeronautically speaking, Trump and Snyder could still amend their flight plans and give priority to their organizations’ well-being. But everything we know about these brothers by different mothers tells us it’s too late. Their egos reached escape velocity decades ago.</p> <p>*******</p> <p><i>For more on Snyder, see this recent Politico piece by&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/dan-snyder-nfl-house-oversight-committee-00035469\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Michael Schaffer</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/dan-snyder-nfl-house-oversight-committee-00035469&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5127000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5127000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>Michael Schaffer</i></a><i>.

The Washington, D.C., attorney general is chasing a Washington Post scoop from 2020 about sexual harassment charges and possible ticket-selling scams. A parallel House committee probe occupies similar trajectory. Meanwhile, the NFL, which fined Snyder $10 million in 2021 for rampant bullying and harassment at the franchise, is continuing its own investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.\n But as the evidence against Snyder mounts, it’s not just Trump the owner has come to resemble. He’s reliving the final days of Richard Nixon’s presidency. Snyder’s fellow owners are starting to tell him he must sell his team for the good of the league, the way prominent senators told Nixon in the summer of 1974 that he had to leave the White House for the good of the country. Indianapolis Colts’ Jim Irsay, no model of propriety himself, told reporters in a Tuesday press scrum, “I believe that there’s merit to remove him as owner.”\n If only more Republican members of Congress had been as forthright about Trump.\n The Snyder equals Trump equation doesn’t balance precisely. Snyder is a self-made billionaire. Trump started his fortune with daddy’s money. Snyder avoids the spotlight like an acned, fidgety 7th-grader. Trump wears a foil reflector to amplify whatever attention is directed his way. Trump is tall. Snyder isn’t.\n But the two have much in common. They favor gaudy mansions. Both have deserved reputations for being cheapskates. Both hate the Washington Post for having showcased their craven ways. Snyder’s affinity for Trump and Trumpism prompted him to give $1 million to the Trump inauguration festivities. Both have filed meritless lawsuits. Both have been accused of sexual assault. Both men talk smack about their associates: Last week, ESPN reported that Snyder claims to have secrets on fellow owners, the league office and the league commissioner that could “blow up” the NFL. “One owner was told by Snyder directly that he ‘has dirt on [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones,’ a team source told ESPN.” (Snyder denies the ESPN allegations.) And both have a way of surprising their business partners in a bad way. Trump’s shady business practices are the stuff of legend. In April, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission citing evidence that Snyder’s team may have kept two sets of books, denying the league and its teams revenues they were due.\n The biggest difference between Snyder and Trump can be found in the way their associates have responded to them. The NFL may actually be moving in the direction of forcing Snyder to sell. There is a precedent for an owner losing his team amid harsh scrutiny. In 2017, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson divested himself of the team after the league launched an investigation over sexual misconduct allegations and use of racist language.\n “I think America, the world, expects us to, as leaders,” Irsay told the press, emphasizing the NFL’s duty to uphold the values it publicly subscribes to. The NFL’s apparent willingness to discipline its wayward kin finds no companion inclination in the Republican Party. Immediately following the Jan. 6 riots, many Republicans sounded like they were done with Trump. But he was not done with them, and soon GOP lawmakers were spotted traveling to Mar-a-Lago to eat Cheetos from his palm and do his bidding. Trump’s demagoguery has soiled the Republican image as much as Snyder’s junky home field (the embarrassment of the league); meanwhile, his team’s abysmal play and dwindling attendance have corroded the NFL brand. At least the NFL might be doing something about this human embarrassment. (Of course, it’s also quite possible the owners will back off just like their Republican counterparts; if they oust Snyder, the thinking goes, they may be risking their own survival if they slip up down the line. And a high bar must be cleared to remove Snyder: 24 of the league’s 32 owners must vote for his ouster. Ultimately, there may be more Mitch McConnells than Liz Cheneys in the NFL.)\n Snyder could go quietly, but who expects that? The only thing he does quietly is lose. Achieving NFL ownership — something Donald Trump lusted after and had to settle for a dismal New Jersey USFL franchise — marks the pinnacle of Snyder’s climb. Rather than surrender, Snyder would likely ignite his retrorocket for a Trumpian orbit of endless lawsuits. And if he really has the explosive dirt on the NFL and its owners that he alleges to have, who would be surprised at him bombing the league he was forced to leave, just as Trump seems happy to destroy the presidency if he can’t have it.\n Like Trump, Snyder isn’t the type to bow, no matter what ill his intransigency spreads. Both men lead storied institutions that have seen much better times. Aeronautically speaking, Trump and Snyder could still amend their flight plans and give priority to their organizations’ well-being. But everything we know about these brothers by different mothers tells us it’s too late. Their egos reached escape velocity decades ago.\n *******\n For more on Snyder, see this recent Politico piece by Michael Schaffer\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/dan-snyder-nfl-house-oversight-committee-00035469\",\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5127000c\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf5127000d\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Michael Schaffer.

Kevin Stitt is still getting last-minute help to close out his reelection bid.</p> <p>Stitt has been deadlocked in a string of recent public polls in the state with Democrat Joy Hofmeister, the state superintendent of education, who switched parties at the end of last year to launch her gubernatorial bid. Some surveys released since the beginning of the month have even shown Hofmeister with a narrow lead over the incumbent governor.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the Republican Governors Association announced a “seven figure” ad buy in support of Stitt — the second time the committee has rushed money into the state this cycle, after a group affiliated with the RGA bought ad time boosting him during the primary.</p> <p>Stitt has faced a surprisingly robust wave of television ads attacking him over the last two years, which his allies point to as the reason why he is locked in a close contest. According to data from AdImpact, an ad tracking firm, over $7 million in advertising has been booked by groups either attacking Stitt or boosting Hofmeister in the general election, with an additional $1 million from her campaign. That’s on top of the at least $6 million more that other organizations spent against Stitt in the GOP primary, which he ultimately won comfortably.</p> <p>And in an unusual display of unity in the state, the leaders of Oklahoma’s five largest Native American tribes all endorsed Hofmeister earlier this month, calling this year’s gubernatorial contest “the most important in generations for all Oklahomans” <a href=\"https://www.choctawnation.com/news/news-releases/leaders-of-states-largest-tribal-nations-endorse-joy-hofmeister-for-oklahoma-governor/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in a joint statement&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.choctawnation.com/news/news-releases/leaders-of-states-largest-tribal-nations-endorse-joy-hofmeister-for-oklahoma-governor/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf515c000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-045b-dc2d-adbf-fedf515c000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">in a joint statement</a>.</p> <p>“We are a community that cares deeply about sovereign tribal nations, who care deeply about Oklahoma,” Hofmeister said in a brief interview, saying the backing of the tribes is something that has been “resonating across the state.”</p> <p>The source of much of the funding battering Stitt has been shrouded in mystery, because it has been run through “dark money” groups that don’t disclose their donors. But Stitt and his allies have placed the blame on the state’s Native American tribes, which have repeatedly clashed with the governor.

Republicans have supermajorities in both of the state legislative chambers.

Roy Cooper, the chair of the DGA, largely demurred: “It is a race that yes, that we can win. We know it is hard in a very red state. But I think, once again, people tend to look at governors a little bit differently, and it is one we hope could happen.”</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Donald Trump won Oklahoma by over 30 points in 2020 — but Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is still getting last-minute help to close out his reelection bid.\n Stitt has been deadlocked in a string of recent public polls in the state with Democrat Joy Hofmeister, the state superintendent of education, who switched parties at the end of last year to launch her gubernatorial bid. Some surveys released since the beginning of the month have even shown Hofmeister with a narrow lead over the incumbent governor.\n Against that backdrop, the Republican Governors Association announced a “seven figure” ad buy in support of Stitt — the second time the committee has rushed money into the state this cycle, after a group affiliated with the RGA bought ad time boosting him during the primary.\n Stitt has faced a surprisingly robust wave of television ads attacking him over the last two years, which his allies point to as the reason why he is locked in a close contest. According to data from AdImpact, an ad tracking firm, over $7 million in advertising has been booked by groups either attacking Stitt or boosting Hofmeister in the general election, with an additional $1 million from her campaign. That’s on top of the at least $6 million more that other organizations spent against Stitt in the GOP primary, which he ultimately won comfortably.\n And in an unusual display of unity in the state, the leaders of Oklahoma’s five largest Native American tribes all endorsed Hofmeister earlier this month, calling this year’s gubernatorial contest “the most important in generations for all Oklahomans” in a joint statement.\n “We are a community that cares deeply about sovereign tribal nations, who care deeply about Oklahoma,” Hofmeister said in a brief interview, saying the backing of the tribes is something that has been “resonating across the state.”\n The source of much of the funding battering Stitt has been shrouded in mystery, because it has been run through “dark money” groups that don’t disclose their donors. But Stitt and his allies have placed the blame on the state’s Native American tribes, which have repeatedly clashed with the governor. (Stitt himself is a member of the Cherokee Nation.)\n \"It's the big casino bosses,\" Stitt told The Oklahoman. \"It's the big tribes.” An ad from his campaign also alluded to this, saying the “insiders and the casino bosses” were attacking Stitt.\n Chuck Hoskin Jr., the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, told The Oklahoman that his tribe does not “fund dark money entities” but “certainly puts resources into races.” Chickasaw Nation Gov. Bill Anoatubby told The Oklahoman that the comments were derogatory. The paper reported that he didn’t directly deny the allegations, but that he also said he didn’t know where Stitt was getting his information from. And Choctaw Nation Chief Gary Batton told the paper that they were going to support Hofmeister “in any way that we possibly can.”\n Calls to the three outside groups spending the most in the general election went unreturned. (The listed phone number for one was not even set up to receive voicemail.) Outside of the RGA-linked spending, Stitt’s campaign has also dropped about $4.75 million on advertising, according to AdImpact, while a supportive dark money group that spent about $600,000 during the primary.\n Hofmeister said she had “no idea” who was funding the spending in the election, and that “if I could get money out of politics, I would do it.”\n Stitt and Hofmeister met for a fiery debate on Wednesday night, where they clashed on education and crime rates. During the debate, Stitt repeatedly tried to tie Hofmeister to President Joe Biden and the larger Democratic Party brand, while she said she would be an independent voice and that Stitt was reading off a “national script.”\n A victory for Hofmeister would represent a dramatic and unlikely shift of power in the state. Republicans have supermajorities in both of the state legislative chambers. The last Democratic governor served over a decade ago, and there are no Democrats in the state’s congressional delegation, after former Rep. Kendra Horn lost the House seat she won in the 2018 blue wave just two years later. (Horn is now running in the special election for retiring GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe’s seat.)\n The Democratic Governors Association has not matched the RGA’s recent spending, and the committee did not contribute to the barrage of advertising that haunted Stitt over the last year.\n When asked about the race at a Pluribus News event earlier this week, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, the chair of the DGA, largely demurred: “It is a race that yes, that we can win. We know it is hard in a very red state. But I think, once again, people tend to look at governors a little bit differently, and it is one we hope could happen.”","dc:creator":"Zach Montellaro","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/fc/17/12f052324d12a5f25c59bad92afe/oklahoma-governor-stitt-70567.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Sue Ogrocki/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Oklahoma Gov.

The majority of states have stopped reporting test positivity or have scaled down their testing reports.\n The bivalent Covid-19 booster vaccine that the Biden administration is promoting to Americans is designed to offer protection against the original Covid-19 strain and the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, which now comprise the vast majority of cases in the country.\n Of particular concern to Biden officials are BQ1 and BQ1.1, both subvariants of BA.5, which early studies indicate may evade some existing treatments for immunocompromised individuals.\n The new booster, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, is still being tested in human trials, and though early data look promising, a full picture of how it protects Americans against infection, transmission and hospitalization of the newer subvariants is not yet available.","dc:creator":"Krista Mahr","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/0b/b8/38c62ad74bd0a4ae730e8c59e811/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1403288241"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Joe Raedle/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"CDC director Rochelle Walensky is isolating at home, per her agency’s guidance, which recommends quarantining for at least five days after testing positive.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/0b/b8/38c62ad74bd0a4ae730e8c59e811/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1403288241"}}]},"content":"The head of the federal public health agency is isolating at home with mild symptoms.","contentSnippet":"The head of the federal public health agency is isolating at home with mild symptoms.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/22/cdc-director-positive-covid-19-00063035","isoDate":"2022-10-22T18:43:46.000Z"},{"creator":"Richard Winton","title":"Kristin Smart's dad, sheriff vow quest for justice isn't over with Paul Flores murder conviction","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-19/kristin-smarts-dad-says-justice-not-over-with-flores-conviction","pubDate":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 19:52:02 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Kristin Smart's family wants closure and the San Luis Obispo County sheriff says he won't give up the case until he finds her body.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Kristin Smart's family wants closure and the San Luis Obispo County sheriff says he won't give up the case until he finds her body.","dc:creator":"Richard Winton","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca35d8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2800x1640+0+0/resize/1500x879!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fc7%2Fde0409e44dc2907659f54243de12%2Fizu83znc.JPG","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"111147.ME.Smart.DOK (Torrance) - - Just across the East Branch Street, from city hall, in the California central coast town of Arroyo Grande, is this sign that helps with public awareness in case involving MISSING Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student Kristin Smart.

In the last week, Republicans bought $3.2 million of new ads in Arizona, according to AdImpact, just over the $2.7 million from Kelly’s campaign and the Arizona Democratic Party.\n And Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC associated with the conservative issue group Heritage Action for America, is airing a new ad twice during Saturday’s Arizona State football game against Stanford. They’re also placing a new $250,000 buy for the ad in Phoenix this coming week.\n \n \n The spot ties Kelly to President Joe Biden while featuring representatives from small businesses, the construction industry, police and border control saying they’re for Masters.\n “Anyone who knows anything about Arizona knows statewide races here are always very close,” said David Bergstein, spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, explaining that the group has made a point to “stay off the poller-coaster” in Arizona this cycle to help the Kelly campaign in a competitive race.\n Chris Hartline, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, similarly referred to Arizona as a “tight race,” accusing Kelly of “sucking up to Joe Biden and D.C . Democrats” while the NRSC has continued to spend money in the state.\n Throughout his campaign, Kelly has sought to portray himself as an independent-minded senator, running television ads about “working with Republicans” and saying he isn’t afraid to “stand up to the left.” At a debate earlier this month, Kelly described some of Biden’s immigration policy decisions as “dumb.”\n A Republican involved in the Arizona race said it now appears that GOP donors and activists alike are beginning to realize that “Blake has a legitimate shot of winning the race.”\n “A month or two ago, I think the generic view of Blake was that he was dead in the water,” the Republican said.","dc:creator":"Natalie Allison","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/4e/5e/0511516b4d5f80f2748849e44af9/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1432089829"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Mario Tama/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Blake Masters speaks at a campaign rally on Oct. 9, 2022, in Mesa, Arizona.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/4e/5e/0511516b4d5f80f2748849e44af9/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1432089829"}}]},"content":"Blake Masters is running just a handful of points behind Democratic Sen.

CNN was discussing new polls that claimed strong support for an attack on Iraq. I worried the administration was so caught up in its own hubris, trapped in its own bubble, misreading history and inflated polls that reflected America’s unity in a time of crisis. They seemed determined to crash right into a war of preemption — without even talking to Congress.</p> <p>I decided to go see the intelligence for myself. Given my role on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I’d always stayed in close touch with the CIA. I wanted to understand what it believed about the Middle East, rather than accepting at face value what leaders told us about these countries. I headed to a secure room in the Capitol to read the intelligence community’s best analysis of what was happening in the authoritarian police state in Baghdad. The solitude of the secure room was a grounding experience: no staff, no phones, just an individual senator and classified documents, to consider the unbiased, unvarnished findings of the intelligence community. Sometimes, we used to joke that the front page of the <i>Washington Post </i>was a better place to find out what was really happening in the intelligence community. Under Ronald Reagan, the CIA had been frustratingly porous, spouting media leaks long before the intelligence ever made its way to Congress. But since 9/11, the community had gone out of its way to be solicitous of Congress, to forge a sense that we were all wrestling with hard decisions together and deserved a common set of facts. My former staffer on the Intelligence Committee, George Tenet, a career intelligence staffer, had performed admirably in this respect.<br></p> <br> <p>Thumbing my way through the material, which was similar to the public record, what jumped out was the conclusion that Saddam Hussein <i>coveted </i>weapons of mass destruction, but the reality was that little had really changed over the years. I wondered whether the eyes of any freshman senator saw the same things that I did with five terms under my belt. Sure, Hussein had pursued weapons of mass destruction since the 1970s, and in the 1980s, we’d been his biggest benefactor as he barreled into an ill-advised war against Iran. This wasn’t new behavior for this master of miscalculation in Baghdad. Where was the smoking gun of a newly revived threat?</p> <p>Many in the administration seemed to draw tenuous connections between Hussein and al-Qaeda, but I remembered just how much he — a largely secular autocrat — had long been the target, not the patron, of al Qaeda zealots who dreamed of restoring a religious caliphate and kicking out the existing order. I read the details: The conclusion was thin; if an al Qaeda terrorist had found safe passage through Iraq en route to Iran, it was hardly a sign of Saddam’s cooperation with al Qaeda and more likely proof of Iraq’s porous border, or the old saying “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” If a terrorist thug was on his way to create chaos in Iran, the regime would happily turn a blind eye to his safe passage.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a5/e3/40aa35b145178bafc48bad720dd8/gettyimages-1249735.jpg\"> <br> <p>My conclusion was caution: I simply didn’t see proof of an imminent threat or a new rush by a madman to obtain weapons of mass destruction. I saw the status quo as it had been for a long time. “<i>Looks like the Middle East,</i>” I said to the intelligence officer sitting at the desk.</p> <p>The following Sunday, [my wife] Marcelle and I went for our usual early-morning walk in the neighborhood. It was a warm September day, and we walked hand in hand.</p> <p>Two fit joggers trailed behind us. They stopped and asked what I thought of the intelligence briefings I’d been getting. Marcelle realized this was a conversation that normally she would not be involved in and kept on walking ahead.</p> <p>I went through a requisite disclaimer that if I was in briefings and if they were classified, I could not acknowledge that they even occurred and could not talk about them if they had. They told me they understood that, but asked whether the briefers had showed me File Eight.</p> <p>It was obvious from the look on my face that I had not seen such a file. They suggested I should and that I might find it interesting. Quickly thereafter I arranged to see File Eight, and it contradicted much of what I had heard from the Bush administration.</p> <p>Days later, Marcelle and I were out walking again when the two joggers reappeared. After the opening greetings, they told me they understood I had seen File Eight and asked what did I think about it?</p> <p>It was the eeriest conversation I’d experienced in Washington. I felt like a senatorial version of Bob Woodward meeting Deep Throat — only in broad daylight.</p> <p>I went through the usual disclaimers that I could not talk about any file and if such a file was available and so on. They said of course they understood, but they wondered if I had also been shown File Twelve, using a code word.</p> <p>Again, I think the look on my face gave them the answer. They apologized for interrupting our walk and jogged off. The next day, I was back in the secure room in the Capitol to read File Twelve, and it again contradicted the statements that the administration, and especially Vice President Cheney, seemed to be relying on, and I told my staff and others that for a number of reasons I absolutely intended to vote against the war in Iraq.</p> <p>I’d been around too long to do differently. It is hard to think of any vote that is taken by the Senate that is more important than voting to go to war or not. While we never had a declaration of war in Vietnam, the falsehoods and misleading information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin episode brought about a vote in the Senate that guaranteed the continuation of the war. Only one senator voted no. Had the Senate asked more questions — had it drilled down into the facts — who knows how history could’ve been different? Instead, that war went on for years and thousands of deaths later, until it was officially ended by a one-vote margin in the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Senate in 1975.</p> <p>I wasn’t alone in questioning the intelligence about Iraq. A conservative Democrat from Florida, Bob Graham, was the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and urged everyone to read the intelligence, which he could not talk about on the floor or in open meetings. His warnings and those of Senator Carl Levin, the lead Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, were a contrast to the administration’s cheerleaders urging senators to meet with a man named Ahmed Chalabi, source of many of the stories that the <i>New York Times </i>and others had printed claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. I refused to meet with him, as I knew his reputation for falsehoods was high and that the press who had backed him were being fooled. The intelligence community referred to him as “Curveball” for a reason.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3d/9f/1305b109480ca7ad96b2c79e13c2/ap03041801618.jpg\"> <br> <p>That Sunday after church, Marcelle and I were out walking through McLean, going by Hickory Hill, the former Robert Kennedy estate, as black cars with multiple antennas and darkened windows passed us by. That was not unusual because of various officials in the administration who lived out in that area. As we reached Georgetown Pike, right by the Quaker meetinghouse, one of the vehicles pulled up. A member of the presidential inner circle leaned out from the back window, greeting both myself and Marcelle, and asked if he could talk with me. We were about a half-mile from home, and she continued on walking. I got in the car with him while the security people got out of the car. We sat there and talked, and he said, “I understand you’ve seen File Eight and Twelve.” I said I had, and I knew of course that he’d seen them. He said, “I also understand you’re going to vote against going to war.”</p> <p>I said, “I am, because we all know there are no weapons of mass destruction and the reasons for going to war are just not there.”</p> <p>He asked if he could talk me out of that, and I said no, and we ended the conversation.

Ultimately, for whom do you fight?\" she asked.\n The White House reporter frequently attracted headlines during the Trump years for her hostile interactions in the press briefing room.\n In her book, she recalled these events as \"devastating\" and \"traumatic\" \"microaggressions\" she faced \"as one of the few Black female reporters doing the People’s Work.\"\n CNN'S APRIL RYAN: VOTING RIGHTS IN THE US HAVE ‘COLLAPSED’\n President Trump was a heavy presence in Ryan's book, making an appearance at least 59 times in the roughly 150-page book.\n A staunch critic of the former president, Ryan lobbed both personal and political attacks against him.\n She directly blamed Trump for \"driving her to drink\" after she received one of the inoperable pipe bombs sent to various Democrats and members of the media during 2018. \n \"My health, which deteriorated because of the stress, worry, and anxiety induced by the actions and deliberate choices of the Trump administration, has rebounded. Donald Trump literally drove me to drink…But what is most striking and most personal to me is this: President Trump terrorized everyone who loves America, especially those who spoke up to defend America in her darkest hour,\" she wrote.\n Despite telling \"The View\" that a reporter shouldn't be part of the story, her book was filled with passages hailing her own self-importance and even complaining when she didn't \"get credit\" in the briefing room.\n \"In the world of journalism, I am an endurance athlete. Through sheer force of will, I have stayed in my profession and climbed. My ascent hasn’t always been welcome, but it has always been needed,\" one passage began. \n In another she griped, \"Unlike my great colleagues and personal friends who are elevated in the coverage for making important and incisive points, I am not. My identity as a Black woman is always erased from The Conversation. Even when we ignite the discussion. Let me be blunt: many people simply do not want to give Black women credit.\"","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/1200/675/Trump-AP-April-Ryan-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","type":"image/jpeg","expression":"full","width":"1200","height":"675"},"media:title":["Trump AP April Ryan Getty"]},"content":"April Ryan boasted that her role as a journalist was to protect democracy against Donald Trump and his allies, in her new book, \"Black Women Will Save the World.\"","contentSnippet":"April Ryan boasted that her role as a journalist was to protect democracy against Donald Trump and his allies, in her new book, \"Black Women Will Save the World.\"","guid":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-reporter-rails-trump-new-book-drove-me-drink-terrorized-country","categories":[{"_":"d791d83a-e702-5bc0-aedf-b4e883c73cab","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/metadata/dc.identifier"}},{"_":"fnc","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/metadata/prism.channel"}},{"_":"Fox News","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/metadata/dc.source"}},{"_":"fox-news/media","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/taxonomy"}},{"_":"fox-news/person/donald-trump","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/taxonomy"}},{"_":"fox-news/newsedge/politics","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/taxonomy"}},{"_":"fox-news/entertainment/genres/books","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/taxonomy"}},{"_":"fox-news/entertainment/the-view","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/taxonomy"}},{"_":"fox-news/media","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/section-path"}},{"_":"article","$":{"domain":"foxnews.com/content-type"}}],"isoDate":"2022-10-23T09:00:12.000Z"},{"creator":"Brittny Mejia, Liam Dillon, Gabrielle LaMarr LeMee, Sandhya Kambhampati","title":"L.A.'s love of sprawl made it America's most overcrowded place.

Oil company executives and analysts have said the move could backfire because it could cause producers to slow their drills if they no longer have access to foreign markets, increasing domestic prices.\n “The temperature appears to be coming down on the export control threat,” said one of the people. “They still haven’t taken it off the table, but said it wouldn’t happen before the midterms.“\n Officials at the White House and Department of Energy did not comment.\n Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Ben Lefebvre","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/c2/11/72961aa24b74a7eca2f2d37c673f/biden-51417.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Andrew Harnik/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"20221018-Biden-AP","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/c2/11/72961aa24b74a7eca2f2d37c673f/biden-51417.jpg"}}]},"content":"Oil prices shot higher last week after the oil producing cartel OPEC and its allied countries announced they would cut their collective production by 2 million barrels a day.","contentSnippet":"Oil prices shot higher last week after the oil producing cartel OPEC and its allied countries announced they would cut their collective production by 2 million barrels a day.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/18/biden-spr-oil-reserve-release-fuel-prices-00062269","isoDate":"2022-10-18T15:58:25.000Z"},{"title":"Minneapolis struggles to recruit police in wake of George Floyd's murder","pubDate":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 09:37:07 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Understaffed police departments in Minneapolis are struggling to fill vacancies following the police-involved murder of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/george-floyd\" target=\"_blank\">George Floyd</a> in 2020.</p> <p>The controversial death resulted in a loss of trust in <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\">law enforcement</a> and subsequent anti-police protests spurred a mass exodus of officers.

Herschel Walker is neck-and-neck with Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, and Blake Masters has narrowed Sen. Mark Kelly’s lead in Arizona. And Republican polling shows Adam Laxalt squeezing past Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada.\n Meanwhile, Republicans stuck in stubbornly tied red states are beginning to show signs of building more durable advantages. Polls now show GOP candidates J.D. Vance and Ted Budd moving ahead of their Democratic opponents in Ohio and North Carolina, respectively.\n \n \n The GOP’s momentum on the Senate battlefield is consistent with national polling showing an uptick for Republicans on the generic congressional ballot, as the party holds the edge when it comes to handling most of the issues at the center of the midterm campaign — especially the economy and inflation.\n And the recent polls align with the POLITICO Election Forecast, which currently rates the fight for Senate control as a “Toss Up.” Barring an upset elsewhere, if the GOP prevails in at least three of the four “Toss Up” races — Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — it will win the majority. Currently, polling averages show Republicans leading in Nevada and Wisconsin, and trailing — though narrowly — in Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n Here is the latest in the 10 states that will decide Senate control:\n 1.\n Arizona\n MARK KELLY (D) vs. Blake Masters (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Kelly +2.5 (Last week: Kelly +4.5)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +4\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n The most notable new poll this week came from a well-known Phoenix lobbying firm, conducted for two TV stations, which showed Kelly leading Masters by about 3 points.\n That's not only closer than some other public polls — it also diverges from a trend in the other statewide race sharing top billing on the ballot: the open race for governor.\n The HighGround poll had Democrat Katie Hobbs narrowly ahead of Republican Kari Lake, by about 1 point. Other polls have showed Kelly running well ahead of Hobbs, and Masters significantly behind Lake.\n 2.\n Colorado\n MICHAEL BENNET (D) vs. Joe O'Dea (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Bennet +7.7 (Last week: Bennet +7.7)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +13.5\n Two new polls from Democratic-leaning firms show Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet on solid footing this week: One showed the incumbent ahead by 11 points over Republican Joe O'Dea, while the other shows Bennet up by 13 points.\n 3.\n Florida\n MARCO RUBIO (R) vs. Val Demings (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Rubio +5.7 (Last week: Rubio +4.7)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +1.4\nEventual margin: Trump +3.3\n A new poll out Friday from Florida Atlantic University showed GOP Sen. Marco Rubio leading Democratic Rep. Val Demings by 6 points, 48 percent to 42 percent — though Demings continues to run ahead of her ticket-mate, former Gov. Charlie Crist.\n 4.\n Georgia\n RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D) vs. Herschel Walker\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Warnock +2.4 (Last week: Warnock +3.3)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +2\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n The two new polls in Georgia this week both point to a dead heat — confirmation that the recent revelations about Walker's behavior have not significantly derailed the Republican's campaign.\n A Landmark Communications poll had Warnock and Walker knotted at 46 percent, while Warnock had an insignificant, 2-point lead in an InsiderAdvantage survey.\n In both surveys, the leader is at 46 percent — short of the majority needed to win the race without a runoff, which would take place on Dec. 6 if necessary.\n 5.\n Nevada\n CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D) vs. Adam Laxalt\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Laxalt +1.2 (Last week: Laxalt +1.7)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +5.2\nEventual margin: Biden +2.7\n A CBS News/YouGov survey this week showed Laxalt just 1 point ahead of Cortez Masto, 49 percent to 48 percent.\n That aligned with new polling from Laxalt's backers at the conservative Club for Growth, which commissioned a survey showing Laxalt ahead by 2 points, \n 6.\n New Hampshire\n MAGGIE HASSAN (D) vs. Don Bolduc (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Hassan +5.4 (Last week: Hassan +5.8)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +7.2\n The only new poll in New Hampshire this week was an internal survey from Republican Don Bolduc's campaign, showing Bolduc trailing Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan by 2 points, 49 percent to 47 percent.\n Internal polls are typically released for a reason, and the underfunded Bolduc was likely trying to attract money to the sometimes-overlooked race. But Friday evening, Senate Leadership Fund canceled planned ad buys in the state, in a sign that the party doesn't see New Hampshire as a likely flip in November.\n 7.\n North Carolina\n Ted Budd (R) vs. Cheri Beasley (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Budd +2.8 (Last week: Budd +1.5)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +2.7\nEventual margin: Trump +1.3\n Budd surged past Democrat Cheri Beasley in two new polls this week, including a 6-point lead in a survey from East Carolina University.\n The race had remained close all summer, though East Carolina's polling has been favorable to the GOP candidate: He led Beasley by 8 points in a May post-primary poll from the school, and by 3 points in September.\n 8.\n Ohio\n J.D. Vance (R) vs. Tim Ryan (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Vance +2.3 (Last week: Vance +0.7)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Trump +0.5\nEventual margin: Trump +8.2\n After months of tied polls, Vance has squeaked past Rep. Tim Ryan in the past week, leading the Democrat by 2 points in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, and 3 points in the latest tracking survey from the GOP firm Cygnal.\n 9.\n Pennsylvania\n Mehmet Oz (R) vs. John Fetterman (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Fetterman +2.4 (Last week: Fetterman +3.4)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +5.6\nEventual margin: Biden +1.2\n Fetterman led Oz in the polls for months, but the Republican continues to close strong in the run-up to Election Day.\n Three new polls this week show either a tied race, or an inside-the-margin Fetterman advantage. And while once-divergent races in other states are starting to converge, it's notable that the tightening Senate race has come while Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro's lead over Republican Doug Mastriano is increasing.\n 10.\n Wisconsin\n RON JOHNSON (R) vs. Mandela Barnes (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Johnson +2.8 (Last week: Johnson +2.8)\n2020 RCP polling average 17 days before the election: Biden +6.1\nEventual margin: Biden +0.7\n There were no new polls in Wisconsin this week, after last week's Marquette Law School poll suggested GOP Sen. Ron Johnson had opened up a real lead over Democrat Mandela Barnes.","dc:creator":"Steven Shepard","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/c3/16/fee6cde04ce295c0d9a426d4dce3/polling-illo-orange.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/Getty Images; AP","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Barring an upset elsewhere, if the GOP prevails in at least three of the four “Toss Up” races — Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — it will win the majority.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/c3/16/fee6cde04ce295c0d9a426d4dce3/polling-illo-orange.jpg"}}]},"content":"A raft of new polls this week in the key Senate battlegrounds showed GOP gains.","contentSnippet":"A raft of new polls this week in the key Senate battlegrounds showed GOP gains.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/22/senate-swing-state-polls-2022-00062752","isoDate":"2022-10-22T11:00:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Rong-Gong Lin II","title":"L.A. hits $1-billion earthquake milestone: 8,000 buildings retrofitted","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-20/l-a-hits-1-billion-earthquake-milestone-8-000-buildings-retrofitted","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:32:50 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>The milestone comes seven years after the City Council passed the nation's most sweeping earthquake safety legislation, requiring that more than 14,000 buildings be retrofitted.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"The milestone comes seven years after the City Council passed the nation's most sweeping earthquake safety legislation, requiring that more than 14,000 buildings be retrofitted.","dc:creator":"Rong-Gong Lin II","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/177521d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2736x1824+0+0/resize/1500x1000!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fzbk%2Fdamlat_images%2FLA%2FLA_PHOTO_SELECTS%2F2019_01%2F3069652-la-me-northridge-earthquake-california08.mem.JPG","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Kehl Tonga, right, a superintendent with Cal-quake construction, works with other crew members in a 2 story apartment building at 5833 Gregory Ave in Los Angeles undergoing an earthquake retrofit.","$":{"type":"plain"}}],"media:credit":[{"_":"Los Angeles TImes","$":{"role":"author","scheme":"urn:ebu"}}]},"content":"<p>The milestone comes seven years after the City Council passed the nation's most sweeping earthquake safety legislation, requiring that more than 14,000 buildings be retrofitted.</p>","contentSnippet":"The milestone comes seven years after the City Council passed the nation's most sweeping earthquake safety legislation, requiring that more than 14,000 buildings be retrofitted.","guid":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-20/l-a-hits-1-billion-earthquake-milestone-8-000-buildings-retrofitted","isoDate":"2022-10-20T19:32:50.000Z"},{"creator":"Christian Martinez","title":"High-speed pursuit from San Diego ends in standoff near LAX; person in custody","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-20/pursuit-from-san-diego-ends-in-standoff-near-lax-person-in-custody","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 22:55:18 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>The chase began before 11:30 a.m. when San Diego police attempted to pull over a vehicle that reportedly sped off onto the freeway.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"The chase began before 11:30 a.m. when San Diego police attempted to pull over a vehicle that reportedly sped off onto the freeway.","dc:creator":"Christian Martinez","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0479ac6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4800x3617+0+0/resize/1500x1130!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F34%2F95%2F52a69e354e288c1123f99ba1eba5%2F1204387-la-me-lax-chase001-ls.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"LOS ANGELES, CALIF. - OCT. 20, 2022.
