While increasingly strained, diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia do persist, and they remain essential for global crisis management. At the U.N. Security Council and in other multilateral forums, the U.S. and Russia have little choice but to work together on sustaining the U.N.’s dozens of peace missions, cross-border aid to Syria, peace negotiations in conflicts like Libya and Yemen and countless other projects.

Designation will make that more difficult. Russia will surely want this sanction lifted before agreeing to any future peace deal, but a state sponsor of terrorism designation is notoriously sticky.

While it is hard to anticipate the economic shockwaves that could flow from designation, as Russia’s economy is far larger from that of any other country previously designated, they could well compound the war’s negative effects on the world’s most vulnerable — who are already suffering from commodity shocks and increasing food insecurity, especially in the Middle East and North and Sub-Saharan Africa.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6313068109112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>Fifth, the nature of a U.S. designation and the criteria generally associated with removal from the list may also heighten Russian worries that U.S. policy is actually aimed at regime change.

Each party currently has the lead in just one seat currently held by the opposition: The Republican is slightly ahead in Nevada, while the Democrat has the lead in Pennsylvania.\n And the polling averages in POLITICO's four Toss Up races remain tight — including in Georgia, where there's only been a single, one-day survey conducted since the allegations that GOP nominee Herschel Walker paid for his then-girlfriend's abortion in 2009.\n This is the first weekly check-in on the latest polling in 10 key Senate races this fall. Each capsule includes the current leader in the RealClearPolitics polling average, where the polls stood at this point in the presidential race two years ago, and the eventual winner (and margin of victory) in 2020.\n 1.\n Arizona\n MARK KELLY (D) vs. Blake Masters (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Kelly +4.1\n2020 RCP polling average 30 days before election: Biden +3.6\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n Two new polls last week, from CBS News/YouGov and CNN, showed Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly running ahead of Republican Blake Masters by 3 and 6 percentage points, respectively. That's also the range of Kelly's leads in the RealClearPolitics average throughout the duration of the race, which has been relatively stable.\n Masters has not led a single public poll — after the primary or before it. And this week's surveys suggested a comeback would be difficult: In the CNN poll, the percentage of likely voters with an unfavorable opinion of Masters was 51 percent — only 35 percent viewed him favorably. That compares to Kelly's positive favorable-to-unfavorable rating: 48 percent to 42 percent.\n 2.\n Colorado\n MICHAEL BENNET (D) vs. Joe O'Dea (R)\nElection Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Bennet +8.3\n2020 RCP polling average: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +13.5\n Last week's only poll in Colorado was from the Democratic firm Data for Progress, which gave Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet a 9-point lead over Republican Joe O'Dea, 50 percent to 41 percent.\n Republicans have held out hope that O'Dea could beat Bennet, who won with just a plurality of the vote in 2010 and 2016. But the race hasn't come online — and Democrats increasing margins here may be too much for O'Dea to overcome.\n 3.\n Florida\n MARCO RUBIO (R) vs. Val Demings (D)\nElection Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Rubio +4\n2020 RCP polling average: Biden +3.5\nEventual margin: Trump +3.3\n GOP Sen.

Now, 10 months into his first year as mayor, he’s been thrust into the position he coveted — but not for the reason he’d hoped.\n Adams’ city is buckling under pressure to accommodate tens of thousands of Latin American asylum-seekers — many bused here by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who is , Washington and Chicago\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/24/greg-abbott-eric-adams-migrant-busing-new-york/\",\"_id\":\"00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe7f70006\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe7f70007\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">making a public show of sending border-crossers to New York, Washington and Chicago.\n It’s also isolated the moderate Democrat mayor, whose political allies are piling on while he’s at war with the GOP and liberal critics protesting his every move.\n The situation, which Adams has repeatedly labeled a “humanitarian crisis,” is the most sustained problem he has faced to date and shows no signs of abating — the result of national and international policies that he cannot control but must contend with.\n \n \n “This is a crisis that’s unfolding and it could undermine our cities in a real way,” Adams said in a phone interview Thursday.\n And he’s seized on the challenge to shame the partisan margins of American politics while facing an operational emergency that is testing how he executes his “get stuff done” ethos. Adams complained this week, \"The far right is doing the wrong thing. The far left is doing nothing.\"\n In the follow-up interview, he extended his criticism to those lobbing attacks without offering space in their own districts.\n He also blamed the White House, from whom he has requested aid and, so far, received none.\n “I think they have been not understanding the full depth of this crisis,” Adams said, in a more pointed critique than he often delivers on the Biden administration’s handling of the situation. “This is a national problem that should not fall on [the city of] Washington, New York and Chicago. This is a national problem and it must have a national solution. And right now I don’t feel we received the level of immediate response that we need.”\n \n \n The White House did not immediately comment. Last month, President Joe Biden condemned Republicans sending migrants across the country as \"reckless\" and \"un-American.\"\n The relationship between the mayor and president has thus far been positive, with Adams even referring to himself as the “Biden of Brooklyn” early in his term. The two met about the migrant crisis when Biden visited the city to discuss hurricane aid for Puerto Rico last month, and their staffs are in constant contact, according to City Hall officials.\n But the mayor and those close to him are growing frustrated as he takes heat from all sides and contends daily with the challenge of housing so many new arrivals to New York.\n “Basically, the mayor has been dealing with this so that the president and the governor don’t have to, but that has now become untenable,” said one person who is close to Adams and declined to speak on the record. “Things have changed in that at first, this was a political stunt and now it’s become a policy of two large, hostile southern states to punish ‘liberals’ in New York for Washington’s policies.”\n \n  \n Meanwhile Adams has publicly called for unity among politicians as his team scrambles behind the scenes to demand more money and help from Gov. Kathy Hochul and Biden, while figuring out how to manage the logistical demands of the city’s new entrants.\n Late last month, he announced an emergency shelter in the Orchard Beach section of the Bronx that helped him buy more time to comply with unique local laws requiring the city provide shelter to the homeless, which the city has reportedly twice violated. But he was forced to hastily relocate the planned campus after intensifying concern about flooding there proved true. Days earlier, NBC reported babies in the shelter system were being underfed. One migrant died by suicide in a city shelter — an incident some state lawmakers laid squarely at Adams’ feet.\n The latest major setback came Monday night. As Adams finished addressing constituents at a town hall focused on his signature issue of public safety, his administration was preparing a 9:30 p.m. press release announcing plans to move the Bronx campus to another location on Randall’s Island, an island near Manhattan that’s largely home to parkland and municipal buildings that’s believed to be less flood prone.\n While the city searches for space and solutions, the impact of the crisis increasingly bears down.\n As of Thursday morning, 17,400 migrants had entered the city since the influx began this spring, according to City Hall estimates. Municipal homeless shelters are at their breaking point, and city schools are scrambling to incorporate thousands of new arrivals in what Adams has dubbed a $1 billion crisis for the city. The situation has also afforded the mayor less bandwidth to deal with issues like rising crime, a housing shortage and gaping vacancies in the municipal workforce.\n On Friday, he declared a state of emergency, suspending some local land use rules, so he could expedite the creation of more emergency shelter facilities. With the crisis “burning through our city’s budget,\" Adams made a public plea to the president and governor for help.\n \n \n Abbott has been sending migrants to New York, as the GOP seeks to make the stunt a winning election strategy in the upcoming midterms. And they are not alone: Democratic El Paso Mayor Oscar Lesser has also sent people crossing the southern border to Adams’ backyard.\n The crisis has isolated a mayor who believes his centrist politics represent the majority of New Yorkers.\n Until now, Adams has enjoyed a marriage of convenience with the city's small Republican contingent. He sided with them in a contentious redistricting process, found common ground in debates over rolling back bail reform measures in Albany and shared their disdain for the far-left flank of the Democratic Party.\n But some of those same conservative allies turned on him upon learning Adams was considering housing the migrants on a cruise ship in a decommissioned naval pier on Staten Island, the city’s Republican bastion.\n “Staten Islanders by and large don’t support sanctuary city policies. We don’t want our neighborhoods and our schools and our infrastructures being burdened by the Love Boat,” Republican City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli said in an interview this week, referring to the ship proposal. “The political problem sorts itself out once the mayor realizes the left will never be happy with anything he does.”\n The asylum issue is now front and center in New York’s congressional races, as both parties brace for the high-stakes midterms.\n GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of Staten Island and her Democratic challenger Max Rose both oppose the cruise ship plan and say national immigration policy is to blame for much of the city's woes. Before that, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, and her Republican challenger each questioned Adams’ plan to build the Bronx intake center in the district they’re vying to represent.\n \n \n Even Adams’ moderate and establishment Democratic allies are shifting from him.\n “There are serious concerns that the necessary planning steps to ensure adequate housing and resources for those that need it are lacking, leaving major gaps,” City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (no relation to the mayor) said in opening remarks at a hearing on the subject last week. The speaker and other five Council members came out against the Randall’s Island plan Wednesday. Through a spokesperson, she declined to comment further.\n And the progressive wing of the party — which has yet to figure out how to effectively oppose Adams — is letting loose its criticisms, bolstered by nonpartisan pushback from New Yorkers who don’t want the situation impacting their neighborhoods.\n This political crisis is playing out as Adams bids on hosting the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Manhattan, a contest that has granted him exposure to national party figures who value his role as a Black Democrat and former police captain who calls out the left on their criticisms of policing.\n In short, the mayor now finds himself all alone.\n “There is no constituency for this,” said Joshua Goldfein, a staff attorney at Legal Aid, a group that advocates and provides legal services for migrants.\n Goldfein was measured in his criticism, careful to avoid lobbing political bombs over such a sensitive matter.

She has suggested repurposing underutilized office buildings and stadiums as temporary shelter — some of which she acknowledged could not be done immediately.\n “I hear many of us making suggestions,” Ramos said in an interview. “Perhaps they’re just not being heard or considered.”\n Joe Anuta and Erin Durkin contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Sally Goldenberg","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/d5/b4/47be1adb465cb4f9e3ea0d632f40/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1418042631"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Spencer Platt/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Migrants bussed from Texas by Gov.

Cold-blooded killer who was vengeful and excited about the murders, or a person so hopelessly deranged that he can’t be anything but crazy?” said Bob Jarvis, a professor at Nova Southeastern University’s law school.\n Cruz's statements were often quite cold-blooded and ruthless in discussing, for instance, how he planned the massacre.\n “I did my own research,” Cruz told Scott. “I studied mass murderers and how they did it, their plans, what they got and what they used.”\n He detailed the lessons he learned: Watch for would-be rescuers coming around corners, keep some distance from your targeted victims, attack as fast as possible — and “the police didn’t do anything.”\n “I have a small opportunity to shoot people for maybe 20 minutes,” Cruz said.\n He also explained why he stopped shooting.\n “I couldn’t find anyone to kill,” he said. “I didn’t want to do it anymore and I didn’t think there was anyone else in the building.”","dc:creator":"Associated Press","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/41/56/aeb222da4ebfb462571ff0196f5e/school-shooting-florida-61165.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun Sentinel via AP, Pool","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Nikolas Cruz, center, stands with members of his defense team as jurors enter the courtroom during the penalty phase of Cruz's trial at the Broward County Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/41/56/aeb222da4ebfb462571ff0196f5e/school-shooting-florida-61165.jpg"}}]},"content":"A jury will likely decide Nikolas Cruz’s fate this week.","contentSnippet":"A jury will likely decide Nikolas Cruz’s fate this week.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/09/parkland-shooter-sentencing-witness-cruz-florida-00061070","isoDate":"2022-10-09T14:26:32.000Z"},{"title":"John David Washington on his Broadway debut","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/john-david-washington-broadway-debut-141700500.html","pubDate":"2022-10-09T14:17:00Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_gl86nsszUWAH2dtaCStbg--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.cbsnewsvideos.com/47d658e545ca14e8567a7c518b980a75","width":"130"}},"guid":"john-david-washington-broadway-debut-141700500.html","isoDate":"2022-10-09T14:17:00.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    My Father Cut Me Out Of His Will.

Ron DeSantis’ chartered migrant flights to Martha’s Vineyard sparked a national outcry and accusations from Democrats that Republicans were trying to shift the midterms conversation away from abortion.</p> <p>But weeks after the migrants landed on the island, DeSantis and GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s migrant transports have shown little effect on the midterms beyond pumping up the bases for the two Republican governors who are both running for reelection.</p> <p>Immigration isn't leapfrogging abortion or the economy on lists of voters' top concerns in national polls and surveys in key battleground states. Spending on immigration-focused ads is up in Florida, Texas and Arizona — where term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has also bused migrants to blue cities — but not elsewhere.</p> <p>“Have they shifted the American electorate’s consciousness to illegal immigration? No,” John Thomas, a Republican strategist who works on House races across the country, said in an interview.</p> <p>\"Outside of the politics of self-interest for these select elected officials, it's not terribly good electoral strategy for the midterms simply because in a lot of these tighter contests, more looking at House races in southern California, places in Arizona and Nevada, it's mostly college-educated white women that are going to decide this thing,\" Thomas said. \"Republicans win on pocketbook issues with them, not busing migrants across the country.\"</p> <p>Immigration is a perennially effective issue for Republicans. Polls consistently give the GOP the edge when it comes to handling immigration. And Republicans have highlighted it to some success in each of the past few cycles, from former President Donald Trump’s calls to “build the wall” in 2016, to the migrant caravans of 2018 ahead of that year’s midterms.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6313448290112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>President Joe Biden’s decision to end the Title 42 border policy this year gave Republicans fodder. And immigration featured prominently in Republican messaging through the primaries.</p> <p>But soaring inflation and skyrocketing gas prices this spring, and the Supreme Court’s decision to upend five decades of constitutionally protected access to abortion, pushed the economy and abortion to the forefront as primaries gave way to general-election fights. In Florida, a devastating hurricane at the end of September that left almost 100 people dead has scrambled midterm messaging there, with Democrats criticizing DeSantis over pocket-book issues like housing and the state’s crumbling insurance industry in the wake of the storm.</p> <p>\"We have the highest property insurance rates in the United States of America because of the lack of leadership we have at the top here in Florida right now,\" Charlie Crist, the former governor and representative challenging DeSantis, said recently.</p> <p>DeSantis faced a major backlash <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/15/desantis-migrants-marthas-vineyard-immigration-florida-00056870\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;over the flights&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/15/desantis-migrants-marthas-vineyard-immigration-florida-00056870&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe7cd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe7cd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">over the flights</a>, with Democrats accusing him of trafficking vulnerable people to score political points and several urging the Department of Justice to investigate the transports.

Ron DeSantis’ chartered migrant flights to Martha’s Vineyard sparked a national outcry and accusations from Democrats that Republicans were trying to shift the midterms conversation away from abortion.\n But weeks after the migrants landed on the island, DeSantis and GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s migrant transports have shown little effect on the midterms beyond pumping up the bases for the two Republican governors who are both running for reelection.\n Immigration isn't leapfrogging abortion or the economy on lists of voters' top concerns in national polls and surveys in key battleground states. Spending on immigration-focused ads is up in Florida, Texas and Arizona — where term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has also bused migrants to blue cities — but not elsewhere.\n “Have they shifted the American electorate’s consciousness to illegal immigration? No,” John Thomas, a Republican strategist who works on House races across the country, said in an interview.\n \"Outside of the politics of self-interest for these select elected officials, it's not terribly good electoral strategy for the midterms simply because in a lot of these tighter contests, more looking at House races in southern California, places in Arizona and Nevada, it's mostly college-educated white women that are going to decide this thing,\" Thomas said. \"Republicans win on pocketbook issues with them, not busing migrants across the country.\"\n Immigration is a perennially effective issue for Republicans. Polls consistently give the GOP the edge when it comes to handling immigration. And Republicans have highlighted it to some success in each of the past few cycles, from former President Donald Trump’s calls to “build the wall” in 2016, to the migrant caravans of 2018 ahead of that year’s midterms.\n \n \n President Joe Biden’s decision to end the Title 42 border policy this year gave Republicans fodder. And immigration featured prominently in Republican messaging through the primaries.\n But soaring inflation and skyrocketing gas prices this spring, and the Supreme Court’s decision to upend five decades of constitutionally protected access to abortion, pushed the economy and abortion to the forefront as primaries gave way to general-election fights. In Florida, a devastating hurricane at the end of September that left almost 100 people dead has scrambled midterm messaging there, with Democrats criticizing DeSantis over pocket-book issues like housing and the state’s crumbling insurance industry in the wake of the storm.\n \"We have the highest property insurance rates in the United States of America because of the lack of leadership we have at the top here in Florida right now,\" Charlie Crist, the former governor and representative challenging DeSantis, said recently.\n DeSantis faced a major backlash over the flights, with Democrats accusing him of trafficking vulnerable people to score political points and several urging the Department of Justice to investigate the transports. At least two lawsuits have been filed against DeSantis over the transports, one on behalf of the migrants and one from Florida democrats accusing the governor of violating state laws regarding how funds can be used. The governor used $615,000 out of $12 million in the state budget set aside to relocate migrants from Florida.\n State records released Friday show that the flights will likely continue until at least June.\n Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a disaster declaration and called up the National Guard to help the hundreds of migrants Abbott has bused to Chicago from Texas. New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Friday declared a state of emergency as his city tries to provide services to the tens of thousands of migrants there, many of whom Abbott also bused from Texas.\n \n \n Polls show DeSantis' Sept. 14 migrant flights are playing well with the Republican base, but not beyond it. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from Sept. 23 showed that just a third of Americans — 53 percent of Republicans versus 16 percent of Democrats — backed the migrant transports. A CBS/YouGov poll from four days later showed 87 percent of Republican voters supported GOP governors sending migrants to Democratic areas, compared to 48 percent of independents and 20 percent of Democrats.\n While the CBS/YouGov survey showed small upticks in the importance of immigration to Republican and independent voters, economic issues remain king. A Monmouth University poll released last week showed 82 percent of Americans view inflation as “very” or “extremely” important, compared to 72 percent for crime, 70 percent for elections and voting, 68 percent for jobs and unemployment and 67 percent for immigration. A Marist poll also released last week showed inflation leading all other issues by 10 points, with abortion edging immigration.\n Inflation and the economy also remain at the top of voters’ minds in battleground states with key races at stake, including Nevada,New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.\n Immigration “hasn’t moved into the top tier of issues,” Suffolk University polling director David Paleologos said in an interview. “The top three issues nationally are still the economy and either abortion and threats to democracy, or threat to democracy and abortion. You add those three up and it’s 60 percent to 70 percent of likely voters.”\n Ad spending on immigration outside of Florida, Texas and Arizona has been inconsistent in the weeks since DeSantis flew migrants to Martha’s Vineyard — another indication that Republican federal and gubernatorial candidates outside of those states don’t see a heavy focus on border security as their path to victory in November.\n Republicans spent nearly $1.4 million on immigration-focused ads the week the migrants landed on the island, according to ad tracker AdImpact. But that dropped to just $726,622 the following week — as Democrats like Crist and Adams started chastising Republicans for trying to shift focus away from abortion with “political stunts.”\n \n \n GOP ad spending on immigration has continued to seesaw, shooting up to $2.6 million the week of Sept. 27 before falling to $948,128 this past, according to analysis from AdImpact.\n By contrast, GOP spending on immigration ads in Florida, Texas and Arizona more than doubled in the week following DeSantis’ move, rising to $4.2 million the week of Sept. 20 from $2 million the week before. That spending peaked at just shy of $4.4 million the following week before falling back down to $2.5 million this past week.\n In that time period, Abbott and Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake went up with new ads accusing their Democratic opponents of supporting “open borders.” In Arizona, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters both put up new spots hammering Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over immigration.\n DeSantis and Abbott’s big immigration plays were never really about the midterms writ large. The governors themselves have cast their migrant transports as a way to bring attention to what they view as the Biden administration’s border security failures.\n Abbott, who has bused thousands of migrants to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, said during a debate earlier this month that he was busing migrants north to help Texas officials “overrun with the number of migrants that border patrol had dumped into their tiny little communities.” DeSantis, through a spokesperson, has said the almost 50 mostly Venezuelan migrants he transported were “homeless, hungry, and abandoned.”\n Strategists say the headline-grabbing transports help two Republicans running for reelection bolster their border bona fides with their bases.\n “That message came loudly and clearly to Republicans in Texas,” Thomas, the Republican strategist, said. “And for DeSantis it’s the same calculator, except one future because he’s positioning potentially for 2024. He needed to have a Trumpian moment, and he got it.”\n A Quinnipiac University poll from late September focusing on Texas showed 92 percent of Republican likely voters approve of Abbott’s busing strategy, as do 51 percent of independents. Immigration was the top issue among all likely voters in the survey that also showed Abbott leading rival Beto O’Rourke by seven points. O’Rourke is now refocusing on gun and school safety, rolling out a new ad campaign featuring families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde tearfully endorsing the Democrat for governor.\n The economy remains the top issue in Florida. But a plurality of voters in a Spectrum News/Siena College poll conducted days before the hurricane hit showed a plurality, 49 percent, of likely voters supported the state sending migrants north.\n And DeSantis led Crist in pre-hurricane polls despite the political and legal risks moving dozens of primarily Venezuelan migrants across state lines could bring. Florida Republicans have been prioritizing courting Venezuelan Americans in south Florida, many of whom fled their home country in the past decade amid the political and economic turmoil under Nicolás Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez, in recent years, raising the possibility of some blowback against DeSantis.\n Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster and consultant based in Florida, contended that for nearly two weeks the controversy over the flights overshadowed other campaign issues. But he added that it did not seem to have any lasting impact.\n “Think of it as a lame MAGA GOP attempt at a Jedi mind trick,” Amandi said. “It may work on their feeble minded stormtroopers but most voters saw through it for what it was.”\n Gary Fineout contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Lisa Kashinsky","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/f1/0a/ed3ef5014d4c884ab94ecb5f4fcf/election-2022-transporting-migrants-02944.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Rebecca Blackwell/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Florida Gov.

The severed causeway to Sanibel and war-zone beach scenes join this summer’s shuttering of Yellowstone in epic floods and the Swiss Alps’ Zermatt in extreme heat as climate reckonings that challenge the very notion of the carefree holiday.</p> <p>In Florida — a real place with human roots that rebut the clueless takes that we can all just up and move — the way forward begins with an understanding that the sunny, paradisiacal vision of the state is both carefully constructed and fairly new. Only a century ago, the Sanibel Island now famed for pristine beaches and seashells was best known for its fruit and vegetable crops. Sanibel grapefruits won state fair prizes. Its castor beans were sold as a cure for yellow fever. Tomatoes grew so plump in the calcified soils they fetched $1.50 a piece in New York City hotels.</p> <p>Then, in October 1921 and again in September 1926, deadly hurricanes churned into Sanibel, one of a string of islands ringing Charlotte Harbor where Ian, and Charley 18 years before, also charged the coast. The Gulf of Mexico overtook the land, drowning the fruit and vegetable farms. The soils never recovered.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/ed/29/943f3c2448fa9e4b4cf2fa816c16/matthewshotel.jpg\"> <br> <p>Survivors turned to a more viable trade: hosting visitors from the Northeast. Only the wealthiest, like fishing pals Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford, could make their way by train and ferry for extended holidays. During the Great Depression, their kind of industrial wealth built livelihoods and a tourist economy on Sanibel and its sister enclave, Captiva, as the rest of Florida spiraled in the state’s first real estate bust.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2a/3b/c3d72c6b4036bce9eaca12821c1b/ford-edison.jpg\"> <br> <p>From the Fountain of Youth to Cape Coral — a former mangrove swamp on the mainland that helped make Florida “a dream state for the working class,” to cite historian and author Gary Mormino — the state’s modern history is often described as a series of lies that came true.</p> <p>Florida, though, is better understood as a place of constant reimagining, its new dream almost always born of disaster. As climate change and crowded coastlines amplify the risks of living here, the question becomes: What’s the next Florida dream?</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\">A misnamed county</h3> <p>Lee County — ground zero for Hurricane Ian as it tore through the barrier islands, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and other towns — was named for the Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. Calusa County would have been more apt. The Indigenous Calusa who inhabited the region when the Spanish arrived in the early 16th century were the first to build dream cities from the coastal bounty of Charlotte Harbor. Pine Island, the old Florida outpost now facing what one resident called “<a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2022/09/29/im-hoping-he-shows-up-pine-island-community-grapples-with-ians-aftermath/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;unfathomable destruction&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2022/09/29/im-hoping-he-shows-up-pine-island-community-grapples-with-ians-aftermath/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe83d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe83d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">unfathomable destruction</a>,” still rises with their white-glinting shell mounds.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3a/f8/709059a544e88b8cca225767282d/meraldclarkcalusabounty.jpg\"> <br> <p>Throughout their 1,500 years on the coast, a series of natural disasters and dramatic climate changes led to innovations rather than collapse. The Calusa moved their homes and public buildings from ground level to the tops of shell mounds. They engineered seawalls and fish pens. They built portlike capitals on Pine Island behind the protective barrier of Sanibel, and on Mound Key behind today’s Estero Island that is home to Fort Myers Beach. Yet they were not the consummate conservationists they are often made out to be, says William Marquardt, curator emeritus of South Florida Archaeology and Ethnography at the Florida Museum of Natural History. They struggled to balance stewardship during times of abundance, and shortages brought on by droughts and floods. Like us, they built massive engineering projects and larger and larger edifices during prosperous times. It all made for a greater fall when they faced crushing violence, pandemics and other disasters in the 17th century.</p> <p>Hispanic fishers were next to reimagine the land-water mosaic of Charlotte Harbor, blending families with surviving Natives and establishing <i>pescadores ranchos,</i> “fishermen’s ranches,” to export fish to Cuba. The<i> pescadores</i> and their families were made American citizens when the United States acquired Florida as a territory in 1821. But Anglo-Americans who wanted the land soon protested, claiming they were squatters. Many of the ranchos were destroyed during the Seminole Wars, when the Native Americans who had coalesced in South Florida fought forced removal to Oklahoma. A few persisted on Sanibel and the small island of Cayo Costa where Hurricane Ian made landfall.</p> <p>The next dreamers, homesteaders lured by New York investors who held dubious title to a Spanish land grant, settled Sanibel with the vision of utopian farms. Like the Calusa and the <i>pescadores</i>, they also fished an unimaginable seafood bounty from Charlotte Harbor. By the end of the 19th century, a few doubled as fishing guides and innkeepers. Legend has it that remote Captiva Island at Sanibel’s northern tip, severed from the rest of the land by the 1921 hurricane, was named for female prisoners held captive there by José Gaspar, the Spanish pirate known as Gasparilla. But André-Marcel d’ Ans, a French anthropologist of the Caribbean, traced the legend to its roots in early Florida land sales. He found “Captiva” was more likely the product of land boosters evoking the romance of the Spanish buccaneers.</p> <p>Florida developers spent the next century making tall tales come true. Waterfront dreams helped make Lee County home to some of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, most famously Cape Coral. TV pitchmen-turned-developers Leonard and Julius Rosen bought the 1,700-acre mangrove swamp where the Caloosahatchee River meets Charlotte Harbor and changed its name from Redfish Point to the more romantic Cape Coral. Their wintertime newspaper ads, run in the snow-bound likes of Chicago and Pittsburgh, promised a sunny “enchanted City-in-the-Making.” Installment payment plans and 400 miles of dredged canals made it possible for many thousands of pensioners to retire waterfront and never shovel snow again.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a3/9d/2df6d8bd411cbeacb910baaf8610/pineislandbrochure1960.jpg\"> <br> <p>Today they are shoveling hurricane debris, and stuck without power, potable water or sewage treatment. Yet many of them will want to stay exactly where they are. The fact that the one-time sham development sprawled into the largest city in Lee County with 200,000 residents — the third-largest between Tampa and Miami — proves the power of the well-timed dream.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\">Bugs Bunny and his tired handsaw</h3> <p>The Rosens left what the journalist and author Michael Grunwald has well described as “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/20/fastest-growing-city-america-florida-cape-coral-215724/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a brutal environmental legacy that still haunts Cape Coral&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/20/fastest-growing-city-america-florida-cape-coral-215724/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe83d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe83d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a brutal environmental legacy that still haunts Cape Coral</a>.” Bulldozing the coastal mangroves at Redfish Point wiped out natural storm protections for the enchanted city and those directly inland including Fort Myers, the Lee County seat. Draining and paving the wetlands that once absorbed floodwaters and recharged aquifers left a ricocheting crisis between too much water and too little. The city now mired in floodwaters cannot supply its fire hydrants in times of drought.</p> <p>In the days and weeks ahead, numbers of additional victims, particularly the oldest and those without family, will be discovered to have perished in Hurricane Ian. Also ahead will be numbers of scolding “shoulds”: that Cape Coral should not exist; that the barrier islands should be returned to nature; that the cities of coastal Charlotte Harbor should not rebuild. Some of the takes make fleeing the state sound as easy as the Looney Tunes meme in which Bugs Bunny saws Florida clean off the nation. Politically, they are about as tenable.</p> <p>The hard work ahead is to understand that the nightmare of Hurricane Ian is likely to spin into a new Florida dream, and to help make sure it is a better one. The questions involve not whether, but what form the dream takes. Can Florida get ahead of the land speculators to buy out Ian victims who want to sell and move? For those who want to stay, can we direct subsidies away from risky coastal construction and toward safe, sustainable communities in Florida’s interior?</p> <p>Florida has never lacked bold land-planning ideas. Watching the state’s growth-at-any-cost mentality during his youth inspired the father of growth management, the late John DeGrove, to develop the profession and Florida’s once-progressive planning laws. Politics always weakened them. Now-Sen. Rick Scott eliminated meaningful state oversight for planning the first year he became governor of Florida.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/d0/09/476f5bd1406eb499338b72ac77d4/sanibelpicnic.jpg\"> <br> <p>Sanibel itself was the only Florida city that ever put the brakes on. The island passed the nationally acclaimed Sanibel Plan in the 1970s under the leadership of Porter Goss, who would later lead the Central Intelligence Agency. At the time, Lee County zoning would have allowed 30,000 residential units on the island; the Sanibel Plan reduced that number to 6,000. Sanibel’s visionary leaders also preserved 67 percent of the island as conservation land, protecting not only the beaches, but the vast estuaries, backwaters and Calusa shell mounds that gave Sanibel its feel of civilized wild.</p> <p>Ian showed that the strongest growth plan in Florida was no match for a Category 4 hurricane. Yet without it, the tragedy still unfolding on Sanibel would be that much grimmer.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\">A delicate balance</h3> <p>If there is one community with the track record and political and philanthropic heft to model a plan for Florida’s ever-riskier coasts, it may be Sanibel. While it’s too early to speculate what that may look like, some political and technical models have proved unifying here.

A wilder coastline with working waterfronts. They would surely include beach tourism. Given the times, we’re all going to need a carefree holiday.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"As heartbreaking images and human stories reveal Hurricane Ian’s destruction along the southwest coast of Florida, the outpouring of sympathy for the people of Sanibel Island and other beach havens also carries a sense of loss for a vintage dream: family vacations, carefree beachcombing, frozen drinks at sunset. The severed causeway to Sanibel and war-zone beach scenes join this summer’s shuttering of Yellowstone in epic floods and the Swiss Alps’ Zermatt in extreme heat as climate reckonings that challenge the very notion of the carefree holiday.\n In Florida — a real place with human roots that rebut the clueless takes that we can all just up and move — the way forward begins with an understanding that the sunny, paradisiacal vision of the state is both carefully constructed and fairly new. Only a century ago, the Sanibel Island now famed for pristine beaches and seashells was best known for its fruit and vegetable crops. Sanibel grapefruits won state fair prizes. Its castor beans were sold as a cure for yellow fever. Tomatoes grew so plump in the calcified soils they fetched $1.50 a piece in New York City hotels.\n Then, in October 1921 and again in September 1926, deadly hurricanes churned into Sanibel, one of a string of islands ringing Charlotte Harbor where Ian, and Charley 18 years before, also charged the coast. The Gulf of Mexico overtook the land, drowning the fruit and vegetable farms. The soils never recovered.\n \n  \n Survivors turned to a more viable trade: hosting visitors from the Northeast. Only the wealthiest, like fishing pals Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford, could make their way by train and ferry for extended holidays. During the Great Depression, their kind of industrial wealth built livelihoods and a tourist economy on Sanibel and its sister enclave, Captiva, as the rest of Florida spiraled in the state’s first real estate bust.\n \n  \n From the Fountain of Youth to Cape Coral — a former mangrove swamp on the mainland that helped make Florida “a dream state for the working class,” to cite historian and author Gary Mormino — the state’s modern history is often described as a series of lies that came true.\n Florida, though, is better understood as a place of constant reimagining, its new dream almost always born of disaster. As climate change and crowded coastlines amplify the risks of living here, the question becomes: What’s the next Florida dream?\n A misnamed county\n Lee County — ground zero for Hurricane Ian as it tore through the barrier islands, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and other towns — was named for the Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. Calusa County would have been more apt. The Indigenous Calusa who inhabited the region when the Spanish arrived in the early 16th century were the first to build dream cities from the coastal bounty of Charlotte Harbor. Pine Island, the old Florida outpost now facing what one resident called “unfathomable destruction,” still rises with their white-glinting shell mounds.\n \n  \n Throughout their 1,500 years on the coast, a series of natural disasters and dramatic climate changes led to innovations rather than collapse. The Calusa moved their homes and public buildings from ground level to the tops of shell mounds. They engineered seawalls and fish pens. They built portlike capitals on Pine Island behind the protective barrier of Sanibel, and on Mound Key behind today’s Estero Island that is home to Fort Myers Beach. Yet they were not the consummate conservationists they are often made out to be, says William Marquardt, curator emeritus of South Florida Archaeology and Ethnography at the Florida Museum of Natural History. They struggled to balance stewardship during times of abundance, and shortages brought on by droughts and floods. Like us, they built massive engineering projects and larger and larger edifices during prosperous times. It all made for a greater fall when they faced crushing violence, pandemics and other disasters in the 17th century.\n Hispanic fishers were next to reimagine the land-water mosaic of Charlotte Harbor, blending families with surviving Natives and establishing pescadores ranchos, “fishermen’s ranches,” to export fish to Cuba. The pescadores and their families were made American citizens when the United States acquired Florida as a territory in 1821. But Anglo-Americans who wanted the land soon protested, claiming they were squatters. Many of the ranchos were destroyed during the Seminole Wars, when the Native Americans who had coalesced in South Florida fought forced removal to Oklahoma. A few persisted on Sanibel and the small island of Cayo Costa where Hurricane Ian made landfall.\n The next dreamers, homesteaders lured by New York investors who held dubious title to a Spanish land grant, settled Sanibel with the vision of utopian farms. Like the Calusa and the pescadores, they also fished an unimaginable seafood bounty from Charlotte Harbor. By the end of the 19th century, a few doubled as fishing guides and innkeepers. Legend has it that remote Captiva Island at Sanibel’s northern tip, severed from the rest of the land by the 1921 hurricane, was named for female prisoners held captive there by José Gaspar, the Spanish pirate known as Gasparilla. But André-Marcel d’ Ans, a French anthropologist of the Caribbean, traced the legend to its roots in early Florida land sales. He found “Captiva” was more likely the product of land boosters evoking the romance of the Spanish buccaneers.\n Florida developers spent the next century making tall tales come true. Waterfront dreams helped make Lee County home to some of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, most famously Cape Coral. TV pitchmen-turned-developers Leonard and Julius Rosen bought the 1,700-acre mangrove swamp where the Caloosahatchee River meets Charlotte Harbor and changed its name from Redfish Point to the more romantic Cape Coral. Their wintertime newspaper ads, run in the snow-bound likes of Chicago and Pittsburgh, promised a sunny “enchanted City-in-the-Making.” Installment payment plans and 400 miles of dredged canals made it possible for many thousands of pensioners to retire waterfront and never shovel snow again.\n \n  \n Today they are shoveling hurricane debris, and stuck without power, potable water or sewage treatment. Yet many of them will want to stay exactly where they are. The fact that the one-time sham development sprawled into the largest city in Lee County with 200,000 residents — the third-largest between Tampa and Miami — proves the power of the well-timed dream.\n Bugs Bunny and his tired handsaw\n The Rosens left what the journalist and author Michael Grunwald has well described as “a brutal environmental legacy that still haunts Cape Coral.” Bulldozing the coastal mangroves at Redfish Point wiped out natural storm protections for the enchanted city and those directly inland including Fort Myers, the Lee County seat. Draining and paving the wetlands that once absorbed floodwaters and recharged aquifers left a ricocheting crisis between too much water and too little. The city now mired in floodwaters cannot supply its fire hydrants in times of drought.\n In the days and weeks ahead, numbers of additional victims, particularly the oldest and those without family, will be discovered to have perished in Hurricane Ian. Also ahead will be numbers of scolding “shoulds”: that Cape Coral should not exist; that the barrier islands should be returned to nature; that the cities of coastal Charlotte Harbor should not rebuild. Some of the takes make fleeing the state sound as easy as the Looney Tunes meme in which Bugs Bunny saws Florida clean off the nation. Politically, they are about as tenable.\n The hard work ahead is to understand that the nightmare of Hurricane Ian is likely to spin into a new Florida dream, and to help make sure it is a better one. The questions involve not whether, but what form the dream takes. Can Florida get ahead of the land speculators to buy out Ian victims who want to sell and move? For those who want to stay, can we direct subsidies away from risky coastal construction and toward safe, sustainable communities in Florida’s interior?\n Florida has never lacked bold land-planning ideas. Watching the state’s growth-at-any-cost mentality during his youth inspired the father of growth management, the late John DeGrove, to develop the profession and Florida’s once-progressive planning laws. Politics always weakened them. Now-Sen. Rick Scott eliminated meaningful state oversight for planning the first year he became governor of Florida.\n \n  \n Sanibel itself was the only Florida city that ever put the brakes on. The island passed the nationally acclaimed Sanibel Plan in the 1970s under the leadership of Porter Goss, who would later lead the Central Intelligence Agency. At the time, Lee County zoning would have allowed 30,000 residential units on the island; the Sanibel Plan reduced that number to 6,000. Sanibel’s visionary leaders also preserved 67 percent of the island as conservation land, protecting not only the beaches, but the vast estuaries, backwaters and Calusa shell mounds that gave Sanibel its feel of civilized wild.\n Ian showed that the strongest growth plan in Florida was no match for a Category 4 hurricane. Yet without it, the tragedy still unfolding on Sanibel would be that much grimmer.\n A delicate balance\n If there is one community with the track record and political and philanthropic heft to model a plan for Florida’s ever-riskier coasts, it may be Sanibel. While it’s too early to speculate what that may look like, some political and technical models have proved unifying here. One is the Florida Wildlife Corridor, a collaboration that has brought together major landowners, scientists, bipartisan political leaders and others in a statewide effort to restore and conserve 18 million acres of connected lands across Florida. More than half those acres have been saved in perpetuity with broad public and political support. The same geographic-information databases scientists use to identify the most ecologically valuable conservation lands in the corridor can also show which areas are wisest to develop. It’s a delicate balance of developing urban corridors least likely to be hit by storms — and preserving the wildlands and farmlands with the highest ecological payoffs, including flood control for people and habitat for animals like the Florida panther. Florida’s Century Commission proposed this precise plan during former Gov. Charlie Crist’s administration. Crist, a Republican-turned-Democrat now challenging Republican incumbent Gov.

Raphael Warnock’s voting record — but makes no mention of Walker or his recent controversies.\n “From D-Day to drag queen story time, America has lost its way. Radical Democrats are indoctrinating our children to hate America — opening our borders and crushing working people with taxes,” the ad says. “Raphael Warnock votes with Biden 96% of the time. Chaos at the border, crime in our neighborhoods, a collapsing economy — Biden and Warnock did that. Take our country back.”\n \n On Friday, AdImpact, a media tracking firm, reported that MAGA Inc. placed a $750,000 ad buy in the state of Georgia in support of Walker.\n The ad comes at a precarious moment for the Georgia Republican. Walker has faced a string of accusations that he pressured the mother of one of his children to have an abortion — once successfully and once unsuccessfully. Walker has denied the stories, which POLITICO has not independently verified. But while his allies have stuck by him, there is clear disagreement over how best to do so.\n His pledge to file a defamation suit did not come to fruition. Instead, Walker’s campaign put out its own ad noting that he had a checkered past and touting the redemption he sought and achieved. And despite the media attention, the Walker campaign says it has raised over $500,000 in the aftermath of the allegation.\n The hard-hitting pushback has been left to the outside groups, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee putting out an ad that attacked Warnock’s character and on deeply personal terms. But so far that spot is only being circulated as a web ad, according to a spokesperson.\n \n \n Internally, the Walker campaign appeared to be in turmoil.

He’s playing the role of governor. He’s concerned about lives and property lost. He can play that up. This is serious business. So he can look equally ‘presidential,’ that he’s dealing with an equal, not a supplicant even though that is precisely what he’s there for.”","dc:creator":"Jeff Greenfield","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/e2/84/d73a85e44380b920c8f6ef77dd92/2022-desantis-biden-sidebyside-getty-773.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Jeff Swensen and Samuel Corum/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Florida Gov.

Pete Ricketts would then appoint a replacement for Sasse under state law, with the seat then up for a special election in 2024. One of the people familiar with Sasse's plans said Ricketts himself is viewed as a potential appointee for the seat.\n The University of Florida confirmed Sasse’s plans in a press release Thursday that announced him as the sole finalist for the position. Given the length of the university’s process, the exact timing of his future resignation is up in the air but likely to happen this year.\n Sasse said he and his wife have been “pursued by wonderful institutions the past two years, but we’ve resisted being a finalist. This time is different because the University of Florida is different: I think Florida is the most interesting university in America right now.”\n The second-term Sasse made a name for himself as a consistent Donald Trump critic in Congress as well as a reliable conservative vote. Despite his interest in academia, his resignation will be a bit of a surprise after he ran for reelection in 2020 and the potential that he could one day pursue higher office.\n Sasse was one of seven GOP senators to vote to convict the former president during Trump's second impeachment trial, after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. His resignation will create a safe GOP seat in a red state; in addition to Ricketts, Nebraska GOP Reps.

Making Twitter a super app is what Salesforce founder Marc Benioff was jabbering about in the text message that surfaced in ongoing litigation last week. <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Wrote Benioff&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe81a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe81a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Wrote Benioff</a>, “Twitter conversational OS — the townsquare for your digital life.”</p> <p>Turning Twitter into your personal operating system makes sense as a business proposition. It also justifies the $44 billion Musk has pledged to buy it. As a stand-alone social media app, it’s not worth that sort of money (even if he truly desires to create a free speech haven). If creating a super app is Musk’s intention, he must understand that few people will want to do their banking on a site that’s associated with white supremacism. He might not choose to ban every form of “harmful” speech, but he’ll have every incentive to make Twitter palatable to the masses as he transforms it.</p> <p>But what about Donald Trump? Should we oppose and boycott Musk’s Twitter because it will spell the return of Trump’s tweets? The agonizing about the damage that Trump’s Twitter account allegedly caused was overblown. Twitter was never the primary source of Trump’s power when he was president.

Will he wreck it by turning it into a disinformation playground, as some critics fear, based on his vow to lift the permanent ban on Donald Trump’s account? Or will he transform it into something that rivals the other triumphs in his portfolio, Tesla and SpaceX?\n Knowing Musk, he could possibly do both, constructing a sewer that poisons you with lies and hate while making it an essential part of consumers’ lives. But you’ve really got to doubt that. Nobody, not even Elon Musk on his most perverse day, would buy a property for $44 billion — 20 percent of his net worth, by the way — and then rebuild it as the world’s largest sewage treatment facility. All the fretting about the “harm” Musk might cause as Twitter’s owner is misplaced: It will be in his financial interests to make Twitter as wholesome and welcoming a place as Starbucks, even if he changes the way the site works.\n So much of the speculation about what Musk will do with Twitter has been based on the dumb things that come out of his big mouth with such regularity — like downplaying the pandemic in March 2020, posting that “pronouns suck,” that he was supporting Kanye West’s presidential campaign, or that one of the Thai cave rescuers was a “pedo guy.” If ever there was a person in need of an editor or a gag order, it’s Musk.\n But countervailing the things Musk says are the things Musk does, which deserve as much if not more attention than his bloviating. And not just his achievements. The Musk resume overflows with one astonishing failure after another. He was fired as CEO of a company he founded. He was kicked out of PayPal, which he helped start. Six SpaceX rocket launches have failed and multiple landings have ended in explosions. Tesla almost went bankrupt during the rollout of the Model 3.\n We also know that Musk perpetually overpromises on what he can deliver. He has issued broken promises on “full self-driving” Teslas, Teslas under $35,000, brain implants, Tesla semis, robotaxis and a production Tesla truck, just to name a few. Oh, and his “best case” scenario for manned flight to Mars is to put a man on the red planet by 2021.\n Musk’s tendency to shoot off his mouth regularly, fail like clockwork and overpromise like a confidence man makes predicting his future a mug’s game. But he also provides ample evidence that beyond these faults, when he takes huge risks, he’s better at learning from his mistakes than anybody in business. If past is prologue, Twitter will explode on liftoff, crash on return and become a metaphor for a fireball once Musk gets his hands on it. Prepare yourself.\n But what will come after Musk makes his colossal Twitter mistakes? Insufficient attention has been paid to his ambition to turn Twitter into a super app like China’s phenomenally successful WeChat, where you bank, book travel, hail rides, order food, buy stuff, pay bills, make appointments, send messages and handle the other web-adjacent minutia of modern living. Making Twitter a super app is what Salesforce founder Marc Benioff was jabbering about in the text message that surfaced in ongoing litigation last week. Wrote Benioff, “Twitter conversational OS — the townsquare for your digital life.”\n Turning Twitter into your personal operating system makes sense as a business proposition. It also justifies the $44 billion Musk has pledged to buy it. As a stand-alone social media app, it’s not worth that sort of money (even if he truly desires to create a free speech haven). If creating a super app is Musk’s intention, he must understand that few people will want to do their banking on a site that’s associated with white supremacism. He might not choose to ban every form of “harmful” speech, but he’ll have every incentive to make Twitter palatable to the masses as he transforms it.\n But what about Donald Trump? Should we oppose and boycott Musk’s Twitter because it will spell the return of Trump’s tweets? The agonizing about the damage that Trump’s Twitter account allegedly caused was overblown. Twitter was never the primary source of Trump’s power when he was president. Even without it, he would have been able to place his incendiary missives at the top of the fold of any newspaper, in the opening minutes of any newscast and at the top of news sites with a press release or a White House driveway interview. Once Musk restores Trump’s Twitter account, his tweets won’t pack the wallop they once did because as ex-president his words convey no tangible power. The press will probably regard his tweets the way they do his Truth Social messages, which is to say it will not treat most of them as news.\n Aside from turning Twitter into a super app, Musk will end up having less influence on its direction than it ultimately will end up having on him. No matter what hijinks Musk performed before, he risked alienating only the 3.2 million or so owners who had purchased Teslas or the scattering of businesses and countries that had contracted with SpaceX to launch a satellite. Now, as Twitter’s owner, Musk will find himself in the critical crosshairs of 41.5 million monetizable daily active users (and, he hopes, plenty more) who he can’t afford to estrange, and he’ll be likely to temper his actions and words in running it. He didn’t buy Twitter to lose money on it.\n In the coming months, pay more attention to what Musk does at Twitter and less to what he says.\n  \nAnd I was rooting for Club Penguin\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin\",\"_id\":\"00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe81b0006\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe81b0007\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Club Penguin to become my digital passport.

Florida stated that the proof of vaccination requirement violated the state’s law against such a mandate.","dc:creator":"David Kihara","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/f6/b4/15d76f03426e9ae0c5f8c12b1b36/virus-outbreak-florida-86823.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Joe Ladapo (left) has previously recommended that young children should not receive the Covid-19 vaccine.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/f6/b4/15d76f03426e9ae0c5f8c12b1b36/virus-outbreak-florida-86823.jpg"}}]},"content":"Joe Ladapo is an outspoken skeptic of Covid-19 vaccines.","contentSnippet":"Joe Ladapo is an outspoken skeptic of Covid-19 vaccines.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/09/twitter-covid-vaccination-florida-surgeon-general-joe-ladapo-00061074","isoDate":"2022-10-09T15:45:18.000Z"},{"creator":"Nathan Solis","title":"Antisemitic fliers distributed at San Marino, Pasadena homes at the start of Yom Kippur","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-06/antisemitic-fliers-los-angeles-yom-kippur-jewish-holiday","pubDate":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 17:05:30 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Fliers with antisemitic messages were left near homes, apparently at random, in San Marino and Pasadena, police said.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Fliers with antisemitic messages were left near homes, apparently at random, in San Marino and Pasadena, police said.","dc:creator":"Nathan Solis","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f0e4ca6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3439x2125+0+0/resize/1500x927!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2F69%2Fd30526a1445db106b00a3d6a2249%2Fla-me-anti-semetic-flyer-san-marino.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Bags containing flyers with anti-semitic messages were distributed in San Marino Tuesday night, on the start of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur.","$":{"type":"plain"}}],"media:credit":[{"_":"KTLA","$":{"role":"author","scheme":"urn:ebu"}}]},"content":"<p>Fliers with antisemitic messages were left near homes, apparently at random, in San Marino and Pasadena, police said.</p>","contentSnippet":"Fliers with antisemitic messages were left near homes, apparently at random, in San Marino and Pasadena, police said.","guid":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-06/antisemitic-fliers-los-angeles-yom-kippur-jewish-holiday","isoDate":"2022-10-06T17:05:30.000Z"},{"title":"Herschel Walker admits he had a relationship with the woman who accused him of paying for an abortion: 'I could have sent some money'","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/herschel-walker-admits-had-relationship-043122394.html","pubDate":"2022-10-08T04:31:22Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H3Rra4UepTzIHbnUjA_RuA--~B/aD0xODc1O3c9MjUwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insider_articles_922/5524d0f0eb27f9798382e11022ce9929","width":"130"}},"guid":"herschel-walker-admits-had-relationship-043122394.html","isoDate":"2022-10-08T04:31:22.000Z"},{"creator":"Olivia Olander","title":"Chris Murphy on Saudi Arabia: 'There's got to be consequences'","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/09/murphy-saudi-arabia-consequences-00061068","pubDate":"Sun, 09 Oct 2022 09:38:27 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/01/bd/52a797884550b01d363cacc010dc/congress-guns-61582.jpg\"> <br> <p>The United States should \"rethink\" arms sales to Saudi Arabia, following the kingdom's support for Russia in the war against Ukraine, Sen. <a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51493\" data-person-id=\"51493\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665325734082,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86ac-dbe7-adc1-a7bc1adf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665325734082,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86ac-dbe7-adc1-a7bc1adf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\\&quot;identifier\\&quot;:\\&quot;51493\\&quot;,\\&quot;url\\&quot;:\\&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51493\\&quot;,\\&quot;preferredName\\&quot;:\\&quot;Sen.

It comes from the notion that commerce drives humans to follow their mutual material interests rather than make destructive war due to passions.</p> <p>This was the animating force behind the U.S. granting China its “most-favored-nation” trade status in 2000, which allows for free trade and economic cooperation. Republicans and Democrats alike assured the public that the deal would bring “constructive engagement” and expose communist China to America’s “ideals” of democracy. Where are we today? Beijing has moved closer to authoritarianism, economic competition is fiercer than ever, and American and Chinese diplomatic relations are near a crisis point, with both countries brandishing threats of war. Free trade has brought some peace, but it has not brought lasting friendship between the world’s two superpowers.</p> <p>The same point could be made for Russia. Germans clearly thought that free trade for Russian oil would bind Vladimir Putin’s kleptocracy to democratic Europe and lead it toward a more prosperous and open society. Instead, it weakened democratic Europe’s capacity to respond to Putin’s dictatorship and his bloody invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Does this mean that the old idea of a “gentle commerce” of free markets, famously espoused in the French Enlightenment, is dead? Perhaps it never really existed. History shows that free markets can be a basis for friendship between powerful nations, but they are far less successful at securing peace and democracy than many have hoped. In fact, the noble talk of the free market was sometimes simply an excuse to engage in the kind of “great power” competition that too often leads to war and plunder.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6313033151112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>The idea that trade brings peace has its origins in humanist thought, which looked to understand natural rights and trade through classical philosophy. In <i>The Freedom of the Seas</i> in 1609, the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius argued that God made the air and water limitless and as such, they were the common property of humankind. This meant that “Every nation is free to travel to every other nation, and to trade with it.” But it also meant that the Spanish and Portuguese could not claim a monopoly on the seas in their empire. Meanwhile, in spite of Grotius’ theory that free passage meant peaceful passage, the Dutch used the freedom of the seas to raid the Spanish and Portuguese empires with their superior naval capacity and famous pirate ships.</p> <p>The idea that free trade could bring peace also found defenders among those searching for a Christian solution for human conflict. According to the influential French jurist and religious thinker Jean Domat, trade was humankind’s punishment for Original Sin. The Garden of Eden was a place where all was provided. Once humans had fallen from grace and into the earthly realm, their punishment was labor and trade. Like Grotius, Domat thought that it was possible to discern immutable laws in nature that, once permitted to operate freely, would set in motion a dynamic market system that would rein in the mercenary tendencies of individuals. The exchange of things would bring with them contracts and “Engagements” between people that would force them to interact civilly with each other for the common good. According to Domat, a free, legally based market would wipe away “Double-dealing, Deceit, Knavery, and all other ways of doing Hurt and Wrong.”</p> <p>This approach was also at the basis of Bernard of Mandeville’s <i>Fable of the Bees</i> (1714), by which the “private vices” of greed could turn into the “public virtues” of peace and prosperity. The French philosopher Montesquieu had a less cynical vision. In his 1748 treatise <i>Spirit of the Laws</i>, he outlined how “gentle commerce” would replace the warring instincts of personal and national pride with the mutual self-interest of trade, which could act as an antidote to jealousy, war and poverty.</p> <p>Mandeville and Montesquieu were writing in the context of what would be more than a century of war between the British and the French over colonial empire and world trade. From the War of Spanish Succession to the Seven Years War to the War of American Independence, some philosophers on both sides of the channel believed that free trade would bring peace.</p> <p>Adam Smith, however, had a more nuanced view. The “father of economics” felt that a country with an absolute monarchy, such as France, did not have the requisite political virtue for free trade. He believed that its monarchical system was controlled by monopolizing merchants who would never let it trade freely. In Smith’s eyes, international free trade had to be between equally virtuous commercial nations. Smith’s hope for peace and free trade came from the British Empire. Smith was writing at the time of the War of American Independence (1775-1783) and hoped that the colonies would remain and form a free trade alliance. He saw the system of empire as a free trade zone that allowed his home city Glasgow to prosper from the trade in grain, tobacco, slavery and manufactured goods. While the American colonies broke away from Britain in 1776, the very year Smith published <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, his classic and complex work on free trade, it would eventually impose trade tariffs in 1783.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6313082777112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>When British free marketeers managed to liberalize their own markets with the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, it heralded a laissez faire era in Britain but did not bring international peace. Richard Cobden, the famed free market leader of the Anti-Corn Law League, believed that free markets, pacifism, industrial know-how, Christianity and good work ethics would lead Britain to home-grown prosperity for the working man. Indeed, the very confidence and wealth that buoyed so many British to believe in the superiority of free markets was grounded in colonial ideals and wealth. The British colonial leader John Bowring used evangelical terms, claiming that imperial force and laissez faire economics could only bring good: “Jesus Christ is free trade,” he exclaimed, “and Free trade is Jesus Christ.” But the Pax Britannica of the Empire was based on gunboats, violent coercion and the pillaging of riches from colonialized nations. It is now estimated that Britain stole more than $40 trillion from India alone during the hundred-year rule of the Raj.</p> <p>And while empire created a free trade zone for the British, it also sparked an almost constant series of colonial wars — from the more than 100 years of war with France in the eighteenth century, to another century of overseas wars with peoples and states in the Caribbean, China, India, Burma, New Zealand, Persia and Africa. Indeed, to gain free market agreements with Latin American countries, Turkey and China, the British relied on military threats. Free trade remained based on naval might. While some British free marketeers called for an end to the reliance on colonialism, confident that free trade agreements with other industrial powers brought peace and advantage to industrially superior Britain, Britain’s competitors began to see that if they wanted the free trade and imperial advantages enjoyed by Britain, they too would need to arm.</p> <p>In 1905, the Cambridge critic of free market economics William Cunningham prophetically warned that the militarization of Japan, Russia and Germany was in direct response to Britain’s one-sided imperial free market and that it could lead to world wars. These countries could not compete with Britain, so from the 1870s to the 1890s, Russia, Italy, Germany, France and America were putting up tariffs against what they considered Britain’s domination of world commerce. Hungry for Britain’s empire and markets, Europe moved toward world war.</p> <p>When World War I arrived, it could be seen as either a product of protectionism and trade war, or, as Cunningham said, a reaction to imperial free market Britain’s dominance.

The most famous of the Austrian free market thinkers, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, formed their free market thought in response to rising socialism, but also in reaction to the Nazi regime which forced them to flee Austria to the United States. Both thought that the state was the ultimate danger to peace, but in the end, when World War II was over, the American state bankrolled the rebuilding of Britain, France, Germany and Japan, using the Marshall Plan to rebuild, but also to dictate democracy to, former foes, and, in doing so, to create the most successful economies of the modern age.

U.S. government support, peace, prosperity and free trade were the dividends for America’s allies.

Democracy is in retreat around the world. The global economy seems poised for a recession. And war has broken out in Europe, while tensions rise between the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, public skepticism about free trade is surging in this populist moment. Can free markets keep the peace? We must hope they can. However, history shows that free trade is often in the eye of the beholder, anyway. Ultimately, a military based pax or deeper common interest might be necessary to keep commerce and the world on gentle terms.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"One of the most enduring ideas in economics is that free markets bring peace between countries. It comes from the notion that commerce drives humans to follow their mutual material interests rather than make destructive war due to passions.\n This was the animating force behind the U.S. granting China its “most-favored-nation” trade status in 2000, which allows for free trade and economic cooperation. Republicans and Democrats alike assured the public that the deal would bring “constructive engagement” and expose communist China to America’s “ideals” of democracy. Where are we today? Beijing has moved closer to authoritarianism, economic competition is fiercer than ever, and American and Chinese diplomatic relations are near a crisis point, with both countries brandishing threats of war. Free trade has brought some peace, but it has not brought lasting friendship between the world’s two superpowers.\n The same point could be made for Russia. Germans clearly thought that free trade for Russian oil would bind Vladimir Putin’s kleptocracy to democratic Europe and lead it toward a more prosperous and open society. Instead, it weakened democratic Europe’s capacity to respond to Putin’s dictatorship and his bloody invasion of Ukraine.\n Does this mean that the old idea of a “gentle commerce” of free markets, famously espoused in the French Enlightenment, is dead? Perhaps it never really existed. History shows that free markets can be a basis for friendship between powerful nations, but they are far less successful at securing peace and democracy than many have hoped. In fact, the noble talk of the free market was sometimes simply an excuse to engage in the kind of “great power” competition that too often leads to war and plunder.\n \n \n The idea that trade brings peace has its origins in humanist thought, which looked to understand natural rights and trade through classical philosophy. In The Freedom of the Seas in 1609, the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius argued that God made the air and water limitless and as such, they were the common property of humankind. This meant that “Every nation is free to travel to every other nation, and to trade with it.” But it also meant that the Spanish and Portuguese could not claim a monopoly on the seas in their empire. Meanwhile, in spite of Grotius’ theory that free passage meant peaceful passage, the Dutch used the freedom of the seas to raid the Spanish and Portuguese empires with their superior naval capacity and famous pirate ships.\n The idea that free trade could bring peace also found defenders among those searching for a Christian solution for human conflict. According to the influential French jurist and religious thinker Jean Domat, trade was humankind’s punishment for Original Sin. The Garden of Eden was a place where all was provided. Once humans had fallen from grace and into the earthly realm, their punishment was labor and trade. Like Grotius, Domat thought that it was possible to discern immutable laws in nature that, once permitted to operate freely, would set in motion a dynamic market system that would rein in the mercenary tendencies of individuals. The exchange of things would bring with them contracts and “Engagements” between people that would force them to interact civilly with each other for the common good. According to Domat, a free, legally based market would wipe away “Double-dealing, Deceit, Knavery, and all other ways of doing Hurt and Wrong.”\n This approach was also at the basis of Bernard of Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees (1714), by which the “private vices” of greed could turn into the “public virtues” of peace and prosperity. The French philosopher Montesquieu had a less cynical vision. In his 1748 treatise Spirit of the Laws, he outlined how “gentle commerce” would replace the warring instincts of personal and national pride with the mutual self-interest of trade, which could act as an antidote to jealousy, war and poverty.\n Mandeville and Montesquieu were writing in the context of what would be more than a century of war between the British and the French over colonial empire and world trade. From the War of Spanish Succession to the Seven Years War to the War of American Independence, some philosophers on both sides of the channel believed that free trade would bring peace.\n Adam Smith, however, had a more nuanced view. The “father of economics” felt that a country with an absolute monarchy, such as France, did not have the requisite political virtue for free trade. He believed that its monarchical system was controlled by monopolizing merchants who would never let it trade freely. In Smith’s eyes, international free trade had to be between equally virtuous commercial nations. Smith’s hope for peace and free trade came from the British Empire. Smith was writing at the time of the War of American Independence (1775-1783) and hoped that the colonies would remain and form a free trade alliance. He saw the system of empire as a free trade zone that allowed his home city Glasgow to prosper from the trade in grain, tobacco, slavery and manufactured goods. While the American colonies broke away from Britain in 1776, the very year Smith published The Wealth of Nations, his classic and complex work on free trade, it would eventually impose trade tariffs in 1783.\n \n \n When British free marketeers managed to liberalize their own markets with the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, it heralded a laissez faire era in Britain but did not bring international peace. Richard Cobden, the famed free market leader of the Anti-Corn Law League, believed that free markets, pacifism, industrial know-how, Christianity and good work ethics would lead Britain to home-grown prosperity for the working man. Indeed, the very confidence and wealth that buoyed so many British to believe in the superiority of free markets was grounded in colonial ideals and wealth. The British colonial leader John Bowring used evangelical terms, claiming that imperial force and laissez faire economics could only bring good: “Jesus Christ is free trade,” he exclaimed, “and Free trade is Jesus Christ.” But the Pax Britannica of the Empire was based on gunboats, violent coercion and the pillaging of riches from colonialized nations. It is now estimated that Britain stole more than $40 trillion from India alone during the hundred-year rule of the Raj.\n And while empire created a free trade zone for the British, it also sparked an almost constant series of colonial wars — from the more than 100 years of war with France in the eighteenth century, to another century of overseas wars with peoples and states in the Caribbean, China, India, Burma, New Zealand, Persia and Africa. Indeed, to gain free market agreements with Latin American countries, Turkey and China, the British relied on military threats. Free trade remained based on naval might. While some British free marketeers called for an end to the reliance on colonialism, confident that free trade agreements with other industrial powers brought peace and advantage to industrially superior Britain, Britain’s competitors began to see that if they wanted the free trade and imperial advantages enjoyed by Britain, they too would need to arm.\n In 1905, the Cambridge critic of free market economics William Cunningham prophetically warned that the militarization of Japan, Russia and Germany was in direct response to Britain’s one-sided imperial free market and that it could lead to world wars.

Paradoxically, the United States provided well over $150 billion in today’s dollars to European countries, and more than $20 billion to Japan, as well as backing government intervention into these economies, to lay the groundwork for a future democratic free trade zone.\n During the Cold War, America’s massive military kept the peace among its industrialized, democratic partners, while waging a cold and hot war against communism around the globe. U.S. government support, peace, prosperity and free trade were the dividends for America’s allies.

And if one does take shape, a House Republican who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity said bluntly that Gaetz \"will never lead that.\"</p> <p>The possible future Oversight chair also counseled his colleagues against letting themselves get pulled into the investigative weeds.</p> <p>\"We’ll request information, we’ll dig, we’ll do anything,\" Comer said. \"But I’m not putting my name on anything that’s not factual.”</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Top House Republicans are crafting a strategy to pummel Joe Biden and his Cabinet with investigations — and potential impeachments — next year after winning the majority. \n Their right flank may yet wreck the whole plan.\n Members of GOP leadership and committee chairs-in-waiting are months into the coordination of headline-grabbing probes to launch should they flip the House this fall, as is likely. At the same time, neither those Republicans nor Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) are publicly weighing in on the possibility of a Biden impeachment — which would consume the country and trigger a backlash with unpredictable fallout for the party.\n “I think that’s a question for the conference,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who typically doesn't shy away from rhetorical bomb-throwing and just last year called for the president to resign, said of impeaching Biden in the next Congress.\n Talk like that is doing little to prevent some of the conference's biggest Trump acolytes from charging ahead with early vows to file impeachment articles even if it risks muddying the party’s messaging. It’s hardly the first time some members have zigged while their colleagues zag, but the rhetorical dissonance comes as party leaders are pressing for unity ahead of November.\n Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and other firebrands have left a trail of breadcrumbs, filing 14 impeachment resolutions since early 2021 that signpost conservatives’ biggest targets if Republicans flip the House. Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland are at the top of the list.\n Asked about impeaching Biden, Greene said that “I think that my colleagues will move to my position because that’s how their voters feel,” adding that she would “absolutely” be introducing articles next year.\n \n In the president's orbit, Democrats predict that House Republicans are on track for an overreach that will cause them painful blowback in 2024. One senior Democratic aide, addressing McCarthy on condition of anonymity, warned that a narrow GOP majority would embolden his right flank to his peril: “Those members will have his balls in such a vice grip that when they say 'jump', he’ll say 'how high', and it’ll be too late before he realizes the fall will kill them.”\n But the calls for caution are also coming from inside the House, where some Republicans warn against getting pulled down a political rabbit hole with no chance of booting Biden from office.\n “I hope we don’t\" impeach Biden, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. \"I would argue we all know, at the end of the day, there’s not going to be a conviction in the Senate. It just injects poison into the system, causes a lot of turmoil.\"\n Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who's expected to lead the Oversight Committee should Republicans take the chamber, demurred recently when asked about a presidential impeachment. \n “That will be a decision that Kevin McCarthy will have to make in communication with Jim Jordan,” Comer said.\n During a Fox News appearance in August, he forecast that a GOP House would be “eager to try to impeach\" Biden. \n Asked lately about internal pressure to impeach Biden, however, Comer simply quipped: “I’m not under pressure, because that’s gonna be McCarthy’s job.”\n Congressional leaders have typically treated presidential impeachments warily. Trump was only the third president ever impeached by the House. Chatter among Republicans about impeachment during the tea-party-fueled opposition to President Barack Obama never moved forward.\n Asked recently about the prospect of impeaching Biden, McCarthy sidestepped: “We just went through four years of watching a political impeachment,\" he told reporters. \"We will uphold the law. We will not play politics with it.\"\n \n \n Nonetheless, internal party politics are bound to propel a vocal impeachment push if the GOP wins the House next month. Nearly 140 sitting House Republicans supported challenges to Biden’s 2020 victory that were fueled by baseless Trump-backed claims of widespread voter fraud, and still more GOP backers of those unfounded claims are poised to join Congress next year.\n But base fervor doesn't quite translate to votes, and impeaching Biden already appears close to out of reach for the House GOP. Of the Biden impeachment resolutions introduced since January 2021, the most support any counts is eight members. While those numbers could grow next year should Republicans take the majority, a broad swath of moderates, more pragmatic-minded members and even old-school conservatives would still need to be swayed.\n Republicans view Mayorkas as a more likely impeachment target than Biden himself, though they would still need to convince leadership and moderates to get on board. Notably, McCarthy opened the door during a recent trip to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n Mayorkas \"has not lived up to his oath,” said Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.), who demurred when asked about impeaching Biden.\n Jordan, whose committee has purview over impeachments, said that the matter was up to members but that Mayorkas \"deserves it\" given his handling of the southern border. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said he would also file a Mayorkas impeachment resolution next year, predicting “plentiful” support from GOP colleagues.\n Democrats have bristled over the GOP attacks against Mayorkas, warning that the party's immigration rhetoric veers toward xenophobic. A person close to the administration accused Republicans of \"launching politically motivated publicity stunts\" rather than wanting to address border-related challenges. \n But impeachment strategy isn't the only oversight schism already cutting through the conference as it tries to lay the groundwork for its first majority since 2018.\n Republicans need to decide if they will form a select committee for what would essentially be a Trump-free Jan. 6 investigation, as some have called for. The current Democratic-run Jan. 6 panel will automatically disband in early January, but Republicans could revive it to pursue their own targets, including reviewing the select committee's finances. \n Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a Trump ally with a penchant for rattling leadership, said he’s had recent conversations with Republicans about the possible idea. But it's also drawing skepticism from senior Republicans and McCarthy hasn’t backed it. \n \n  \n Another option for House Republicans seeking to erase Trump from the narrative of Jan. 6 failures would be using the Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over elections and Capitol security, to launch an investigation next year. Retiring Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, now the panel's top Republican, and aspiring Administration successor Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) have both proposed that idea.\n “I don't know why you would need a select committee. The Senate didn't need a select committee to do their job,” Davis said.\n Then there's a likely House GOP probe of Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings. Gaetz raised eyebrows within the conference recently by meeting with former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, who is floating himself as a potential staff director next year for an investigation of the First Son.\n Gaetz said he met with Gorka “to discuss general strategy for a Republican expected majority, and I wanted his perspective on whether or not he would advise ... one committee owning the Hunter Biden stuff.\" The Floridian, who praised Comer's work, said a potential select committee is part of discussions he's having. \n Comer, whose panel is expected to take the lead on a probe of the president's son, shot down the notion of a select committee. And if one does take shape, a House Republican who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity said bluntly that Gaetz \"will never lead that.\"\n The possible future Oversight chair also counseled his colleagues against letting themselves get pulled into the investigative weeds.\n \"We’ll request information, we’ll dig, we’ll do anything,\" Comer said. \"But I’m not putting my name on anything that’s not factual.”","dc:creator":"Jordain Carney","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/8a/b4/189aacde4147a61b395017dbf3d6/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1177076170"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Alex Wong/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"House Minority Leader Rep.

It was the first Saturday of September, and the fields and trees were saturated with the deep green that comes just before the yellows and oranges of fall. But at the time, it was still summer, and things had yet to turn.</p> <p>“In towns like this … nobody likes to make things political. We have to get along here. We live too close together,” Dr. Anne Colby, a chiropractor, who had come out to rally, said. “But I guess you can’t avoid it.

Two women turned and walked away when I asked about the Senate race. They were here for one issue only: abortion rights.</p> <p>After a man with long hair sang a song with an acoustic guitar, the first speaker was Mike Franken, the Democratic nominee for Republican Chuck Grassley’s Senate seat. Franken told everyone he’s the youngest of nine, that he has a lot of sisters and women in his life and that he wants to let them make their own health care decisions. “As a male, I feel woefully inadequate to dictate women’s rights,” he said. It was hard to tell if the ensuing applause was tepid, or if the crowd was just small.</p> <p>The message wasn’t particularly radical, but it felt that way in a state where the governor, Kim Reynolds, once <a href=\"https://www.dmcityview.com/political-mercury/2022/08/03/what-reynolds-said-about-abortion-penalties-when-she-hit-the-statewide-stage/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;called abortion “equivalent to murder&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dmcityview.com/political-mercury/2022/08/03/what-reynolds-said-about-abortion-penalties-when-she-hit-the-statewide-stage/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8230000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8230001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">called abortion “equivalent to murder</a>” and where state legislators every year pass abortion restrictions, only to have them tossed out in the courts.</p> <p>Colby told me that she hoped Franken stayed and listened to the speakers. “Too often politicians just show up, beg for a vote, then leave. It’s telling who they take for granted,” she said. As we talked, I noticed that Franken was in fact leaving in the middle of a woman’s abortion story.</p> <p>Iowa has long been thought of as one of the few purple states, oscillating between Republican and Democratic control. But that is changing, with most political offices at all levels more reliably red and with Republican presidential candidates winning the state by increasingly large margins over the past few elections. The expectation was that 2022 would be brutal for Democrats in a state where Biden polls terribly. Biden has never even won the majority of the Democrats in Iowa; he lost three attempts at the caucuses in 1988, 2008 and 2020. And midterms are typically bad for the party in power.</p> <p>As a result, funding from the Democratic Party has dried up, along with organizing infrastructure, and all the big names in the Iowa Democratic Party chose to sit this year out. As one Iowa lobbyist, who was granted anonymity because they were concerned about maintaining a positive working relationship with politicians in both parties, told me, “It’s the Iowa Democratic D-listers’ time to shine.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/ad/51/ba7519924628ba8d294bfe90784d/secondarylenz.3.jpg\"> <br> <p>D-lister might be a good term for Franken: Franken won the primary after Abby Finkenauer, the former congresswoman, faced a legal challenge over allegations that her ballot signatures weren’t properly dated. Finkenauer had been favored to win. But after the challenge to her candidacy failed before the state election board, two Republican activists sued to get her off the ballot. Two months before the primary, a state judge ruled that three of her signatures were invalid, taking her name off the ballot. The state Supreme Court overturned that ruling, but it seemed her allies in the state were already done. Local pundits chided her for carelessness. Finkenauer stayed on the ballot but lost the primary.</p> <p>As the challenge to Finkenauer built, Iowa Democrats coalesced around Franken. Tired of losing, they wanted to play it safe, play it conservative. And that means a fight over the middle line of Iowa politics. Finkenauer isn’t radical, but she is a woman, which is risky enough in the red state. The Democrats’ play was Franken, a man with a military record, who is exactly the same age as the median age of senators, 64, and whose former campaign manager alleged he had inappropriately kissed her.</p> <p>In April, Kimberley Strope-Boggus a Democratic organizer, and Franken’s former campaign manager, filed an incident <a href=\"https://www.iowafieldreport.com/campaigns/breaking-police-report-mike-frankens-former-campaign-manager-accused-candidate-of-assault/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;report&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.iowafieldreport.com/campaigns/breaking-police-report-mike-frankens-former-campaign-manager-accused-candidate-of-assault/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8230002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8230003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">report</a> with the Des Moines police department about the kiss, which she alleged happened in March.

But thanks to years of under-investment in rural Iowa, the party has a scrappy campaign operation and a struggling candidate. While an allegation of assault might not be the deciding factor in the race, it certainly is no help to the Franken campaign at this moment.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/b1/27/6510514c45a1bc9da5d620e6cc8f/960x0.jpeg\"> <br> <p>I spent a weekend reporting on the campaign, and even before the allegation came to light, it was easy to sense the anti-climactic feel of it all. For Democrats, the big moment could finally be here: An unpopular Supreme Court ruling, combined with an aging incumbent senator, has given Dems the first chance in a long time to flip a Republican seat in Iowa. But no one involved seems prepared, and in the weeks since, it’s become even clearer that the supposedly safe choice is anything but.<br></p> <br> <p><b>The last time Franken ran</b> for office, he didn’t make it out of the primary. In 2020, Franken sought the Democratic nomination to run against Joni Ernst. He lost the primary to Theresa Greenfield, a Des Moines businesswoman. The Ernst-Greenfield matchup went on to attract $173 million in outside spending — making it the fifth most expensive race of the 2020 cycle.</p> <p>On paper, Democrats’ preference for Greenfield made sense: She had strong business credentials, a midwestern accent and a background as a farm girl. Her name literally spells out “there’s a green field,” a seemingly auspicious coincidence that was hard to miss watching her signs punctuate the Iowa landscape. Despite the well-funded and coordinated effort, Greenfield lost to Ernst in the general election. After that, it seemed that Iowa, famously a purple state, was now deep red.</p> <p>It had been trending in that direction for decades: Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, but only 41.7 percent of the vote went to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 44.9 percent went to Joe Biden in 2020. In 2020, Republicans almost completely controlled the state: Both legislative chambers were majority Republican, along with the governor, both U.S. senators, and all but one House member.

Fans of Franken, inspired by John Fetterman’s Pennsylvania Senate campaign, have been trying to organize a secret meme group on Twitter. A couple of people in the group send me images of the memes, which are often just pictures of Franken listing his accomplishments. Not exactly viral fodder.</p> <p>“National Democrats have trouble understanding our state, and that’s led to some disappointment the last few cycles,” Franken’s communications director, CJ Petersen, told me.</p> <p>These problems are common when it comes to Democrats and rural states. After the 2010 midterms, Nancy Pelosi disbanded the House Democratic Rural Working Group. Later, Sen. Harry Reid dismantled the Senate’s rural outreach group, which facilitated Democratic messaging in rural areas. Even if they weren’t successful, the dismantling of the groups sent a signal that the Democratic National Committee was focusing on cities. In 2016, the Clinton campaign had only a single staff person doing rural outreach, and that staffer was assigned to the role just weeks before the election, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-rural-voters-trump-231266\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to POLITICO&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-rural-voters-trump-231266&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8240000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8240001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">according to POLITICO</a>. In 2018 the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, told MSNBC, ‘You can’t door-knock in rural America.’”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/86/98/80e48134448fa2a34fca49556195/ap22159063244999.jpg\"> <br> <p>Canyon Woodward, a former campaign manager for Democratic Maine state Sen. Chloe Maxmin, with whom he co-authored the book <i>Dirt Road Revival</i>, told me that as early as 2009, rural areas of America, weren’t as heavily red as they are now. The split is something he attributes to “Democratic leadership and the consultant class throwing up their hands and saying that investing in rural areas wasn’t efficient. And this has come at the expense of building relationships with the regular folks.”</p> <p>And this bleak political landscape means that many politicians are sitting this out.</p> <p>Not Franken, though.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Franken is the kind of</b> folksy, rough-around-the-edges candidate that could be perfect with Iowa’s mostly middle-of-the-road voters.</p> <p>Previously, Grassley has been able to make his opponents seem too slick, too D.C.-affiliated, too big city and condescending for a small state ruled by the laws of Big Ag. But Franken isn’t particularly slick. And at times, that can look like an asset.</p> <p>It’s also a liability. Franken is usually ready to tell an off-color story and often unfiltered to the point of concerning aides. Now, after the allegation, those qualities are looking even more like a liability.</p> <p>After a 37-year career in the Navy, including time leading Operation Enduring Freedom in the Horn of Africa, Franken resigned because Donald Trump was elected, and decided to run for office again, he said, after the January 6 insurrection.</p> <p>He’s quick with a wild drinking story. One he told me as we were driving to a campaign event was about the last time he got seriously drunk was in 1983 as a Navy officer in Bahrain. As he was telling me the story, JD Scholten, the campaign's political director who was driving us, looked up in the rearview mirror of the black Ford Explorer. Scholten ran twice against former Iowa Congressman Steve King, who has a history of making racist remarks, and is now running for an Iowa House seat in an uncontested race. So he’s helping Franken’s campaign. Scholten has heard this story before, but still, his eyebrows raised in the rearview mirror.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/eb/cc/58a2ab7a40d3bc4714b555b3eb8a/ap212536247348.jpeg\"> <br> <p>He got so drunk, Franken continued, he passed out at a picnic with a piece of goat meat in his hand. When he woke up hours later, he had to report back for duty.</p> <p>So he walked the long walk back to the ship. When he got there, his executive officer looked at him and said, “Mr. Franken?”</p> <p>\"Yes, sir.”</p> <p>\"Would you like to put shoes on?\"</p> <p>In addition to the story about Bahrain, on our ride-along, he told me he met his wife when he and some Navy buddies crashed a garden party in California on motorcycles. He was suspended from high school for skipping to go to baseball games. He told me a story about going to jail at 14. He was in a car full of teen boys on their way home from a church roller skating party and drinking beer. When they got pulled over, Franken told the rest of the boys to hide the beer in their coat sleeves. Not everyone got the message, and when the boys got out of the car, empty cans tumbled out, too. But Franken had been able to hide four full cans up his sleeve. And no one patted him down. When he got to the holding cell, he opened the beers and passed them around to the other guys in the jail. (Scholten looks into the rearview mirror during this story, too.)</p> <p>In a statement, sent to me over text, Strope-Boggus told me, “Anyone who knows me, knows that I am honest to a fault. Michael Franken kissed me without my consent. It happened. And now, again, without my consent, I am being mentioned by both sides as though I am a disposable pawn in the political machine. I hope we can all take a step back and look at how we treat women who come forward and how we react to their stories. What happened to me and what is happening now is not my fault. It's his. That has always been, and will remain, the truth.”</p> <p>According to the police report, when the investigating officer asked Strope-Boggus if she thought Franken “did these things in an aggressive or sexual manner,” Strope-Boggus said no, explaining that Franken “has an old fashioned view of how to interact with women” and that she believes that Franken thinks hugging and kissing women is “part of his charm.”</p> <p>“Kimberly did not describe any sexual intent nor any intent to harm either her or any of the other women,” the report also notes.</p> <p>A woman with knowledge of the incident, who was granted anonymity to avoid retaliation from Democrats in the state, concurred in this estimation of Franken, comparing the allegations against Franken to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;allegations&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8240002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8240003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">allegations</a> <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;against&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8240004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8240005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">against</a> Biden, when women accused the then-vice president of behavior that made them feel uncomfortable.

Franken is affable, gaffable and, for now, the best guy they got.<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"There were only about 20 people present at the abortion rights rally in Clinton, Iowa, a town of 25,000 people. It was the first Saturday of September, and the fields and trees were saturated with the deep green that comes just before the yellows and oranges of fall. But at the time, it was still summer, and things had yet to turn.\n “In towns like this … nobody likes to make things political. We have to get along here. We live too close together,” Dr. Anne Colby, a chiropractor, who had come out to rally, said. “But I guess you can’t avoid it. Not if you want any rights left.”\n The rally was supposed to be in a nearby park but had to move to a vacant lot due to a dispute over the rally permit. We were surrounded by once-beautiful houses, now dilapidated but still standing. Everyone seemed exhausted.\n \n  \n No one I met considered themselves a radical, and no one used the term leftist, which is typical in Iowa, where 30 percent of registered voters are independent, a contrarian streak so infamous it’s been celebrated in Meredith Willson’s famous song “Iowa Stubborn.” Most people at the rally were uncomfortable even talking about electoral politics. Two women turned and walked away when I asked about the Senate race. They were here for one issue only: abortion rights.\n After a man with long hair sang a song with an acoustic guitar, the first speaker was Mike Franken, the Democratic nominee for Republican Chuck Grassley’s Senate seat. Franken told everyone he’s the youngest of nine, that he has a lot of sisters and women in his life and that he wants to let them make their own health care decisions. “As a male, I feel woefully inadequate to dictate women’s rights,” he said. It was hard to tell if the ensuing applause was tepid, or if the crowd was just small.\n The message wasn’t particularly radical, but it felt that way in a state where the governor, Kim Reynolds, once called abortion “equivalent to murder” and where state legislators every year pass abortion restrictions, only to have them tossed out in the courts.\n Colby told me that she hoped Franken stayed and listened to the speakers. “Too often politicians just show up, beg for a vote, then leave. It’s telling who they take for granted,” she said. As we talked, I noticed that Franken was in fact leaving in the middle of a woman’s abortion story.\n Iowa has long been thought of as one of the few purple states, oscillating between Republican and Democratic control. But that is changing, with most political offices at all levels more reliably red and with Republican presidential candidates winning the state by increasingly large margins over the past few elections. The expectation was that 2022 would be brutal for Democrats in a state where Biden polls terribly. Biden has never even won the majority of the Democrats in Iowa; he lost three attempts at the caucuses in 1988, 2008 and 2020. And midterms are typically bad for the party in power.\n As a result, funding from the Democratic Party has dried up, along with organizing infrastructure, and all the big names in the Iowa Democratic Party chose to sit this year out. As one Iowa lobbyist, who was granted anonymity because they were concerned about maintaining a positive working relationship with politicians in both parties, told me, “It’s the Iowa Democratic D-listers’ time to shine.”\n \n  \n D-lister might be a good term for Franken: Franken won the primary after Abby Finkenauer, the former congresswoman, faced a legal challenge over allegations that her ballot signatures weren’t properly dated. Finkenauer had been favored to win. But after the challenge to her candidacy failed before the state election board, two Republican activists sued to get her off the ballot. Two months before the primary, a state judge ruled that three of her signatures were invalid, taking her name off the ballot. The state Supreme Court overturned that ruling, but it seemed her allies in the state were already done. Local pundits chided her for carelessness. Finkenauer stayed on the ballot but lost the primary.\n As the challenge to Finkenauer built, Iowa Democrats coalesced around Franken. Tired of losing, they wanted to play it safe, play it conservative. And that means a fight over the middle line of Iowa politics. Finkenauer isn’t radical, but she is a woman, which is risky enough in the red state. The Democrats’ play was Franken, a man with a military record, who is exactly the same age as the median age of senators, 64, and whose former campaign manager alleged he had inappropriately kissed her.\n In April, Kimberley Strope-Boggus a Democratic organizer, and Franken’s former campaign manager, filed an incident report with the Des Moines police department about the kiss, which she alleged happened in March. The police report included details of the alleged misdemeanor assault, which the police subsequently decided was “unfounded” and prosecutors declined to investigate further, citing “insufficient evidence and information to pursue a criminal investigation.” The report came to light when a conservative Iowa website published it in September.\n In a statement, the Franken campaign called the allegations false. “This accusation was investigated by the Des Moines Police Department and the Polk County Attorney's Office who found no wrongdoing and closed the case as unfounded,” campaign manager Julie Stauch wrote.\n Franken’s chances for November were bleak even before the allegations surfaced: Fivethirtyeight shows Grassley ahead by over 7 points, and Inside Elections rates the race as solidly Republican. But Grassley, a popular senator for over 40 years, has seen his popularity in the state waning in recent years. A recent Des Moines Register poll put 8 points between Grassley and Franken, making it Grassley’s most competitive race since 1980.\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2022/07/16/iowa-poll-chuck-grassley-senate-race-mike-franken-approval-rating-elections/10062297002/\",\"_id\":\"00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe823000a\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe823000b\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Des Moines Register poll put 8 points between Grassley and Franken, making it Grassley’s most competitive race since 1980. And since the Dobbs ruling, Iowa Democrats have found more energy. At a fundraiser for Democratic candidates at Sutliff Farm, outside of Cedar Rapids, Democrats grabbed me excitedly. “I think we can,” one said. “We might be able to … ” another began. “We have a chance,” another said. A poll commissioned by the Franken campaign put only 4 points between the men. Franken’s campaign signs read, “I believe Michael Franken can defeat Chuck Grassley.” The “I believe in fairies” of Midwestern politics.\n Post-Dobbs, a Democrat might have a chance at an Iowa Senate seat. But thanks to years of under-investment in rural Iowa, the party has a scrappy campaign operation and a struggling candidate. While an allegation of assault might not be the deciding factor in the race, it certainly is no help to the Franken campaign at this moment.\n \n  \n I spent a weekend reporting on the campaign, and even before the allegation came to light, it was easy to sense the anti-climactic feel of it all. For Democrats, the big moment could finally be here: An unpopular Supreme Court ruling, combined with an aging incumbent senator, has given Dems the first chance in a long time to flip a Republican seat in Iowa. But no one involved seems prepared, and in the weeks since, it’s become even clearer that the supposedly safe choice is anything but.\n \n The last time Franken ran for office, he didn’t make it out of the primary. In 2020, Franken sought the Democratic nomination to run against Joni Ernst. He lost the primary to Theresa Greenfield, a Des Moines businesswoman. The Ernst-Greenfield matchup went on to attract $173 million in outside spending — making it the fifth most expensive race of the 2020 cycle.\n On paper, Democrats’ preference for Greenfield made sense: She had strong business credentials, a midwestern accent and a background as a farm girl. Her name literally spells out “there’s a green field,” a seemingly auspicious coincidence that was hard to miss watching her signs punctuate the Iowa landscape. Despite the well-funded and coordinated effort, Greenfield lost to Ernst in the general election. After that, it seemed that Iowa, famously a purple state, was now deep red.\n It had been trending in that direction for decades: Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, but only 41.7 percent of the vote went to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 44.9 percent went to Joe Biden in 2020. In 2020, Republicans almost completely controlled the state: Both legislative chambers were majority Republican, along with the governor, both U.S. senators, and all but one House member. A Des Moines Register poll from July showed that only 23 percent of Iowans hoped Biden would run again.\n Democrats have been observing these longtime trends, and they have reacted not by investing more in Iowa but by withdrawing. In 2020, Greenfield received millions from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, while DSCC spokesman David Bergstein has told POLITICO that the organization is not involved in Franken’s race this year. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer spent $15 million from his own campaign funds to support Democratic Senate challengers; none of it went to Franken.\n To date, Grassley has raised $7.49 million, much more than the $4.6 million raised by Franken.\n \n  \n As a result, Franken’s campaign has a scrappy sandlot quality to it, with a lean staff of less than 30. Fans of Franken, inspired by John Fetterman’s Pennsylvania Senate campaign, have been trying to organize a secret meme group on Twitter. A couple of people in the group send me images of the memes, which are often just pictures of Franken listing his accomplishments. Not exactly viral fodder.\n “National Democrats have trouble understanding our state, and that’s led to some disappointment the last few cycles,” Franken’s communications director, CJ Petersen, told me.\n These problems are common when it comes to Democrats and rural states. After the 2010 midterms, Nancy Pelosi disbanded the House Democratic Rural Working Group. Later, Sen. Harry Reid dismantled the Senate’s rural outreach group, which facilitated Democratic messaging in rural areas. Even if they weren’t successful, the dismantling of the groups sent a signal that the Democratic National Committee was focusing on cities. In 2016, the Clinton campaign had only a single staff person doing rural outreach, and that staffer was assigned to the role just weeks before the election, according to POLITICO. In 2018 the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, told MSNBC, ‘You can’t door-knock in rural America.’”\n \n  \n Canyon Woodward, a former campaign manager for Democratic Maine state Sen. Chloe Maxmin, with whom he co-authored the book Dirt Road Revival, told me that as early as 2009, rural areas of America, weren’t as heavily red as they are now. The split is something he attributes to “Democratic leadership and the consultant class throwing up their hands and saying that investing in rural areas wasn’t efficient. And this has come at the expense of building relationships with the regular folks.”\n And this bleak political landscape means that many politicians are sitting this out.\n Not Franken, though.\n \n Franken is the kind of folksy, rough-around-the-edges candidate that could be perfect with Iowa’s mostly middle-of-the-road voters.\n Previously, Grassley has been able to make his opponents seem too slick, too D.C.-affiliated, too big city and condescending for a small state ruled by the laws of Big Ag. But Franken isn’t particularly slick. And at times, that can look like an asset.\n It’s also a liability. Franken is usually ready to tell an off-color story and often unfiltered to the point of concerning aides. Now, after the allegation, those qualities are looking even more like a liability.\n After a 37-year career in the Navy, including time leading Operation Enduring Freedom in the Horn of Africa, Franken resigned because Donald Trump was elected, and decided to run for office again, he said, after the January 6 insurrection.\n He’s quick with a wild drinking story. One he told me as we were driving to a campaign event was about the last time he got seriously drunk was in 1983 as a Navy officer in Bahrain. As he was telling me the story, JD Scholten, the campaign's political director who was driving us, looked up in the rearview mirror of the black Ford Explorer. Scholten ran twice against former Iowa Congressman Steve King, who has a history of making racist remarks, and is now running for an Iowa House seat in an uncontested race. So he’s helping Franken’s campaign. Scholten has heard this story before, but still, his eyebrows raised in the rearview mirror.\n \n  \n He got so drunk, Franken continued, he passed out at a picnic with a piece of goat meat in his hand. When he woke up hours later, he had to report back for duty.\n So he walked the long walk back to the ship. When he got there, his executive officer looked at him and said, “Mr. Franken?”\n \"Yes, sir.”\n \"Would you like to put shoes on?\"\n In addition to the story about Bahrain, on our ride-along, he told me he met his wife when he and some Navy buddies crashed a garden party in California on motorcycles. He was suspended from high school for skipping to go to baseball games. He told me a story about going to jail at 14. He was in a car full of teen boys on their way home from a church roller skating party and drinking beer. When they got pulled over, Franken told the rest of the boys to hide the beer in their coat sleeves. Not everyone got the message, and when the boys got out of the car, empty cans tumbled out, too. But Franken had been able to hide four full cans up his sleeve. And no one patted him down. When he got to the holding cell, he opened the beers and passed them around to the other guys in the jail. (Scholten looks into the rearview mirror during this story, too.)\n In a statement, sent to me over text, Strope-Boggus told me, “Anyone who knows me, knows that I am honest to a fault. Michael Franken kissed me without my consent. It happened. And now, again, without my consent, I am being mentioned by both sides as though I am a disposable pawn in the political machine. I hope we can all take a step back and look at how we treat women who come forward and how we react to their stories. What happened to me and what is happening now is not my fault. It's his. That has always been, and will remain, the truth.”\n According to the police report, when the investigating officer asked Strope-Boggus if she thought Franken “did these things in an aggressive or sexual manner,” Strope-Boggus said no, explaining that Franken “has an old fashioned view of how to interact with women” and that she believes that Franken thinks hugging and kissing women is “part of his charm.”\n “Kimberly did not describe any sexual intent nor any intent to harm either her or any of the other women,” the report also notes.\n A woman with knowledge of the incident, who was granted anonymity to avoid retaliation from Democrats in the state, concurred in this estimation of Franken, comparing the allegations against Franken to the allegations against Biden, when women accused the then-vice president of behavior that made them feel uncomfortable. She noted that Franken “frequently crossed boundaries with women,” kissing them on the cheek and hugging them.\n Another person, who has experience working with Franken and was granted anonymity because she also feared political blowback, confirmed this behavior. “It’s really uncomfortable,” the person said.\n In response to these descriptions, Stauch, the campaign manager, wrote in an email: \"There is no news in these anonymous statements. The only allegation, described weeks ago in a Republican blog, is false and was found to be unfounded by two separate law enforcement entities.\"\n \n  \n Many Iowa Democrats are coming to his defense. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Art Cullen, defended Franken, calling him “innocent until proven guilty.” Left-leaning Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist, Todd Dorman, called the story about the alleged assault a “political hit job” and argued that while Franken may be damaged, more women would be damaged by Grassley.\n Ras Smith, a former state rep from Waterloo and a former Franken staffer who got national headlines in 2020 for his advocacy for meatpacking and food-processing plant workers, briefly launched a bid for governor before dropping out earlier this year because he doesn’t think the state Democratic Party aligns with his values anymore. Smith also worked for the Franken campaign but quit after the primary because he was tired of Democratic politics in the state.\n Smith thinks Iowa Democrats are more concerned with differentiating themselves from Republicans in superficial ways than pursuing progressive policies. “We are the party of ‘we are not like them,’” Smith said, “rather than deciding this is who we are.” Smith said that during his campaign in the primary for governor, he got the message that the party wouldn’t stand behind him. Smith is no longer in politics. He works with Communities in Schools of Mid-America, a nonprofit that helps school-age children in their families with food and housing, and other resources.\n Stuck in a reddening state with little support from the national party, Iowa Democrats are a party clinging to a swiftly crumbling center, instead of changing. The net result of that is losing young politicians like Smith and Finkenauer. The struggle mirrors the larger struggle of the state, which ranks as the 10th worst in the nation for brain drain.\n In Iowa, as in other red and purplish states, Democrats are unsure about their prospects, equipped with a less-than-stellar bench and choosing the option that seems safer on paper: one white male to take on another. Here, it’s less about hope and change and more about holding fast to the center in a state veering to the right. No matter the cost. Franken is affable, gaffable and, for now, the best guy they got.","dc:creator":"Lyz Lenz","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/6d/ba/3c58ffe142649eb62f788d063903/franken-speech.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Stephen Maturen/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Democratic Senate candidate Mike Franken speaks at an election-night event on June 7, 2022 in Des Moines, Iowa.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/6d/ba/3c58ffe142649eb62f788d063903/franken-speech.jpg"}}]},"content":"After years of underinvestment in Iowa, Democrats didn’t stand much of a chance at Grassley’s Senate seat.

He predicted serious talks to fund the government wouldn't kick off until \"about a week before” the deadline.\"</p> <p><i>Toby Eckert, Alice Miranda Ollstein, Nicholas Wu and Connor O’Brien contributed to this report.</i></p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Tens of billions in hurricane relief for Florida are landing on Congress’ to-do list for a post-election lame-duck session that already looked grueling.\n It may take weeks for Florida officials and the Biden administration to come up with a federal aid estimate to rebuild following Hurricane Ian. Ultimately, both parties expect a whopping price tag that loads further labor on lawmakers returning to Washington after the midterms.\n Thanks to hurricane relief, government spending and more, this year’s lame duck is shaping up as Congress’ busiest and most intense since the bipartisan “fiscal cliff” deal inked 10 years ago after a session that stretched through the caroling season. Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) drolly predicted days filled with “what everyone wanted to do during the Christmas holidays: watch C-SPAN.”\n There’s the funding deadline on Dec. 16 and the annual must-pass defense bill, which will suck up lots of oxygen. Congress delayed several other tough issues, from same-sex marriage to energy permitting to preventing another Jan. 6 riot, into the post-election session. And hanging over it all is the closely contested midterms.\n If Democrats lose the Senate, they’ll face enormous pressure to confirm as many judicial nominees as possible to lifetime appointments. If House Democrats improbably hold on to the majority, there may be less of a crush of legislation — but plenty of drama around their caucus’s leadership contest.\n A complete Republican takeover could leave the GOP eager to clear the decks ahead of 2023. Republicans are also starting to sweat the debt limit, which could be nearly a year away.\n And some Democrats want to maximize the returns from their time in power, regardless of the Election Day result.\n “The lame duck is going to be very lame,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), who wants Democrats to push an expansive agenda while they still control both chambers of Congress. He predicted that pressure would be ”extremely strong to get every piece of legislation that we feel is important to our constituency and to the country on the floor.”\n Congressional spending leaders stress there’s no immediate pressure to respond to Hurricane Ian, one of the most damaging storms ever to hit the region, because FEMA’s disaster fund has enough cash to meet immediate needs. Still, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is urging Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to consider reconvening the chamber early, keeping Ian aid separate from the messy year-end funding package.\n “Hurricane Ian’s catastrophic damage in Florida requires a national response,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “We have begun building out a disaster supplemental to meet those needs, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure it passes without delay, drama or waste.”\n Beyond the storm, Democrats put myriad other politically volatile items to the side before the election, leaving them to return in the final days of the 117th Congress. That includes bipartisan negotiations on legislation protecting same-sex marriage and modernizing the 19th-century Electoral Count Act, designedas a safeguard against future attempts to challenge fairly decided elections.\n The House has already passed its own same-sex marriage and electoral certification bills, but the Senate has its own ideas, so the two chambers will need to compromise. Currently, GOP leaders say they will consider passing only the Senate version of the Electoral Count Act bill.\n “It’s a high priority for us. I believe it’s a high priority for the senators,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Democratic caucus. “At some point, we’ll be able to get together and figure out how to proceed.”\n Schumer is planning to bring up a bipartisan same-sex marriage deal after shelving the bill before the election instead of risking its demise thanks to a Republican filibuster. Chief sponsor Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) said, “I remain really confident that this will pass when it comes up.” She and other backers are betting GOP support grows once the midterms are over.\n And as the longest 50-50 Senate ever draws to a close, Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-W.Va.) energy permitting bill is still in limbo after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell threatened to filibuster any attempt to attach it to government funding. Before senators left Washington last month, however, Manchin said he shook hands with McConnell and seemed to still think there’s still a deal with Republicans to be had.\n Any such deal he can cut, of course, risks another progressive backlash in the House.\n The must-pass bill with the highest stakes of all this winter is the massive spending measure that will carry Congress through the next fiscal year. Potentially along for the ride are a half-dozen measures that include hurricane relief money, more military aid for Ukraine, a massive water resources bill, flood insurance renewal and annual extensions of targeted tax breaks.\n Democratic leaders, as well as many top Republicans, are aiming to finish the multitrillion-dollar bundle by Christmas Day.\n “I’d like to get it done so we can start fresh next year,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho).\n But if Republicans do wrest back control of the House, there’s growing chatter among some conservatives about derailing that bill until after New Year’s to maximize their leverage. Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson, who serves in House GOP leadership, said he’s “open to the dialogue” and added that “I see both sides” of the argument. However, most hope to avoid a replay of 2018, when former President Donald Trump’s border demands sparked a lengthy shutdown.\n Any year-end funding deal on the Hill is usually a magnet for loose ends and last-minute legislative priorities. This time around, there will certainly be another Democratic push for long-stalled Covid and monkeypox aid money.\n Democrats also seek to revive the expired Child Tax Credit enhancement, while Republicans want to revive a tax benefit for businesses that allowed them to immediately write off their research expenses. More tax breaks could be in play, in addition to expansion of retirement savings incentives.\n Because it often takes the Senate a week or more to process standalone bills, several packages of unrelated legislation could get stitched to the spending deal Frankenstein-style. It’s a scenario all too familiar for a Congress that never seems to get its work done on time.\n “There’s a scenario where the biggest sacrifice is sleep for a couple weeks,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.). When asked what he was most worried about in this season’s crunch time, he said: “Losing the majority.”\n Negotiators could attempt the ultimate decks-clearing deal by adding what’s likely to be the GOP’s biggest headache in 2023: raising the nation’s borrowing limit.\n Top Democrats and Republicans alleviated the last debt crisis in December after Senate Republicans folded from a hard-line position against hiking the debt ceiling. If Republicans take the House, though, emboldened conservatives may try once again to extract spending cuts in return for a debt ceiling lift.\n The exact deadline to address the debt limit is uncertain. Congress could have until late next year, but a pricey year-end spending deal and President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could also move up that date.\n “I’d rather just keep that out for right now, and do some negotiations on what we can get from the debt limit later on,” said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.).

In plea paperwork, Jeremy Bertino admitted to preparing to use force to stop the transition of power to Biden and said his group — sometimes seen as more of a rowdy drinking club — had hardened its posture and prepared for violence to keep Trump in office, including against police.\n Notably, Bertino had previously testified to the Jan. 6 select committee, telling lawmakers that Proud Boys membership had surged in 2020 after Trump told the group to “stand back and stand by” during a presidential debate.\n \n The Proud Boys, in particular, reacted after Trump tweeted a Dec. 19, 2020 call to supporters to descend on Washington for a “wild” protest against his defeat. Notably, the the tweet came just hours after an Oval Office meeting with outside advisers in which they discussed using the military to support Trump’s effort to stay in power.","dc:creator":"Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/c8/68/4b89b1a847cc98ead3624362b4a8/ap22250013416639.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Susan Walsh/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"The Justice Department says Stewart Rhodes and his allies prepared for an “armed rebellion” against the government, seeking Trump’s blessing but ultimately pressing ahead without him after Trump did not assert emergency powers.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/c8/68/4b89b1a847cc98ead3624362b4a8/ap22250013416639.jpg"}}]},"content":"The Oath Keepers’ trial has placed a brighter light on the hopes and expectations of those who showed up on the Capitol to stop the certification of Biden’s election.","contentSnippet":"The Oath Keepers’ trial has placed a brighter light on the hopes and expectations of those who showed up on the Capitol to stop the certification of Biden’s election.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/08/trump-insurrection-oath-keepers-rhodes-00061055","isoDate":"2022-10-08T11:00:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Benjamin Oreskes","title":"Jeffrey Katzenberg donates $1 million to support Karen Bass' bid for L.A. mayor","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-06/katzenberg-spielberg-jj-abrams-karen-bass-million-donation-la-mayor","pubDate":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 20:26:19 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Hollywood figures Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and J.J.

I feel more calm,” she said, as she banked the plane east, making a big circle over the airport. She wore a black and green Jennifer-Ruth Green for Congress polo, a jean skirt, and black and white Chuck Taylor All-Star low tops.<b> </b>She was unwinding from a long day on the campaign trail, with no destination in particular — a rare moment for a hard-charging candidate.</p> <p>Flying is key to Green’s still-evolving political brand. In one ad, she stands in front of a plane, wearing a green civilian flight suit with Civil Air Patrol and Tuskegee Airmen badges sewn on. “I’m not just a pilot,” she says, “or a combat veteran. I’m Jennifer-Ruth Green.” In another ad, she poses in front of a fighter jet with the at-risk kids she mentors in her faith-based, non-profit organization, MissionAero, aimed at introducing youth to careers in the aerospace industry.</p> <p>The sun dipped in the sky. Green looked out of the pilot-side window and pointed to the steel mills that dotted the landscape of this corner of Northwest Indiana, farmland, and the Chicago skyline beyond on the western border of her district’s boundaries. The district includes U.S. Steel’s Gary Works, the largest steel mill in the nation, situated in Gary, a hollowed-out Rust Belt city. Economic refugees who have fled Illinois seeking Indiana’s friendlier tax climate have made this district more competitive in recent cycles, she said.</p> <p>“It’s such an incredibly diverse district,” said Green, who identifies as Black and Asian. “The majority of the district is blue-collar workers who take care of their bills and take care of their families — the middle 80 percent of the country. You don’t have granola bars or tree huggers. Everybody sits in this happy middle.”</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/21/96/15c3f3e545138ed02f2ef25c6a1f/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>The political mood on the ground might not be quite as cheerful. There’s an unexpected amount of drama for a district that hasn’t voted for a Republican in 92 years.

Of the 26 Black women in Congress, all are Democrats. Of the Republicans running in the 47 most vulnerable Democratic districts, 38 percent are military veterans, according to the Cook Political Report. Thirty-four percent are women. Twenty-three percent are non-white. Seventy percent are at least one of those things. Green is <i>all three</i>, just one of two candidates on the ballot this November to hold such a distinction. (Anna Paulina Luna, a fellow Air Force vet, who is Hispanic, is running in Florida’s<b> </b>13th<b> </b>District.)</p> <p>Green recognizes the rarity of being a Black woman and conservative — something she recalls having an awareness of early in life. “There was a point I remember thinking that it was us, the Powells and the Rices who were the only Black Republicans in the country,” she said, referring to the two former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. When she announced her congressional bid last year, many friends and students who take flight lessons from her expressed “consternation” about her party affiliation.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/39/46/7aa2ffc34ecba29646683b134d5b/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>She does not sound like a Powell or Rice, though.

Later, she would pick up Spanish, French and Tagalog.</p> <p>When she was in kindergarten, her mother went back into the medical field, and so her father watched her after school. “We’d come home and we’d have two hours and it would be either 30 minutes of rest, 30 minutes of piano practice, 30 minutes of chores, 30 minutes of just reading,” Green said. “And then after that, we could all have dinner” — but while giving a 5-minute brief of whatever they had just read. Whoever won pocketed a dollar bill.</p> <p>Green attended the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in 2005 as one of just 15 Black female cadets in a class of 919. Her intention was to become a pilot but she didn’t pass her flight training, according to military records, and <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104502/air-force-office-of-special-investigations/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665140302723,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf09-d5ef-ad97-bf7d2ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665140302723,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf09-d5ef-ad97-bf7d2ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104502/air-force-office-of-special-investigations/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b218-d513-a19b-bbdc91a20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;transferred into special investigations&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b218-d513-a19b-bbdc91a20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">transferred into special investigations</a>, which “identifies, investigates and neutralizes criminal, terrorist and espionage threats.” By 2009, she was a captain stationed in Iraq, part of a unit responsible for turning over the provisional government to the Iraqis. “It was a treacherous time,” she said.</p> <p>Her job, in part, was to conduct site visits at the national training center, Iraq’s FBI equivalent, evaluating their facilities and law enforcement curriculum. Her military evaluations praised her for evaluating 24 Iraqi intel course syllabi, something that expedited “curriculum development by months” and “professionalized agent training.” She “personally advised [the] Iraqi equivalent of [the] FBI Academy Director,” according to military records obtained by POLITICO.</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/95/79/96fff2f94efb98f520f1e8fa2f5f/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>Green’s mostly stellar military record took an unexpected hit in early 2010, according to military records. In an evaluation of her performance spanning from March 15, 2009 to Dec. 15, 2009, she received a “does not meet standards” rating in leadership skills, professional qualities, and judgment and decisions. The evaluation centered on “two instances of lacking judgment while deployed; handling your weapon and wandering away while at a [forward operating base].”</p> <p>In the first case, she was given a letter of counseling for loading her weapon inside a military facility. The second more serious incident occurred in September, according to her military records, when she and a small group of officers visited the national training center. She left the group to climb into a cramped guard tower where Green says an Iraqi serviceman sexually assaulted her by grabbing her breast and exposing himself.</p> <p>She said she was advised not to report the assault by a staff sergeant, who was also a military equal opportunity representative. He told her that “if American leadership complained to Iraqi leadership, they would continue to see women as liabilities and limit their ability to serve….”</p> <p>The poor evaluation, which was performed by someone who was not in Iraq with Green, affected her ability to rise in the ranks and in 2012 she was removed from active duty as part of a larger force reduction, according to her records. Green has appealed the evaluation, citing supporting letters from her superiors stationed in Iraq. Her direct supervisor, a senior agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, wrote in her appeal that she “did an outstanding job in her duties; I did not question her leadership, judgment or professional skills.”</p> <p>In 2017, she joined the Indiana Air National Guard. She now serves as a lieutenant colonel and commander and chief information officer. She has received consistently high evaluations.</p> <p>“I’m a survivor of sexual trauma in the military, and I am being forced to discuss it publicly for the first time because Congressman Mrvan or his supporters obtained — either illegally or by egregious error — military records describing my sexual assault as well as performance reviews, and peddled those records to the media with the intent smear me and my military career,” she wrote in a statement to POLITICO. “The performance review being pushed to discredit my leadership is false.” (Green has not contested the authenticity of the documents, which were obtained by a public records request and provided to POLITICO by a person outside the Mrvan campaign.)</p> <p>“After reporting my assault against the advice of officials in my command, my career was intentionally derailed. I appealed the findings with the military and the issue is settled. I have unquestionably progressed as a military member, promoting to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and successfully completed a command tour,” Green wrote in her statement to POLITICO. “As I have always, I will move forward and succeed despite obstacles such as this thrown in my path.”</p> <p>A Department of the Air Force spokesman said: “We remain committed to building a culture of respect, where sexual assault and harassment are not tolerated in any form and we will do this by supporting victims and prosecuting offenders through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.”</p> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Jennifer-Ruth Green Watches the State of the Union</h3> <p><b>G</b>reen settled in to watch the State of the Union in February 2020 on her couch. She watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tear up the pages of the president’s address.</p> <p>“It was a visceral gut reaction. I just felt sick to my stomach,” Green said. Not long after, the political novice decided to run for Congress.</p> <p>“The third most powerful person in the country, knew that for her to have applause, and to have people write a headline about her was more important than making sure that our adversaries didn’t see instability, just led me to believe that there’s a great failure there,” she said.</p> <p>I asked her if what happened a year later on Jan. 6 was perhaps more egregious in terms of demonstrating instability to our enemies.</p> <p>“I would say they would feel that it would be a source of instability as well,” Green said, though with notably less enthusiasm.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/1e/64/d0227b8f4e46a32db63c34de9ebe/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary4.jpg\"> <br> <p>Green entered early into what would become a crowded primary field.</p> <p>In May, Green won her seven-way primary by figuratively hugging Donald Trump, and criticizing her most prominent opponent, Blair Milo, for not attending the 2016 Republican Convention. Milo, the former mayor of LaPorte and a Navy veteran, was the only person in the field who had previously won elected office. In one ad she called Milo a “Never-Trump Liberal,” criticizing her for having reservations about attending the GOP convention in 2016. Now, Green is distancing herself from Trump. “President Trump was just very, very vocal in his style of leadership,” Green says now. “And his personality was not something that I want to emulate.”</p> <p>Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, former ambassador to the United Nations and potential presidential 2024 candidate, arrived in town recently to fundraise for Green, netting her another $20,000 or so as she continues to outraise her Democratic challenger. A few weeks earlier, Green pumped discounted gas alongside former Vice President Mike Pence. The last Republican who ran in this district spent only $14,000 and lost by 16 points. Green racked up more than that in one event, a signal that she is a different kind of GOP candidate.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Jennifer-Ruth Green in Brazil</h3> <p><b>“I</b>’m going to pray for dinner,” Green said, a bacon, cheese and potato omelette and Coke before her at Mi Tierra, a Mexican restaurant at the airport in Griffith. “Dear Lord, thank you very much for this food. Thank you very much for the safety. God, I ask that this food would be blessed to our bodies and help us get back safely to our homes tonight.”</p> <p>Green’s favorite character is Barnabas, a “minister of missionaries,” she says, who helped the Apostle Paul spread the Gospel. She was inspired to get her pilot’s instructor certification in 2015 while on a mission trip in Brazil, where there was a need for pilots to fly into the Amazon.</p> <p>Green sees herself as a political missionary, a cultural translator who can bridge the divide between Republicans and minority communities on issues like the social safety net.</p> <p>“I think when we talk about welfare programs, we just can’t have people who get a job and then all of a sudden you’re cut off entirely,” Green said. “That’s just not an incentive and it’s more debilitating than it is helpful.” On this issue, Green presents herself as a moderate Republican — making her a better fit for a Democratic district.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3f/94/c4cfafa04c0bbf039ee7d02f1d02/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p>Mia Love, the former Black Utah Republican congresswoman, said Green’s hopes to lead such an effort could meet resistance if elected. “What she thinks and what the reality she is going to find are vastly different, because there are people that are in Washington who have seniority and committees that will lead on those issues, when in reality, she might be the right messenger,” Love said.</p> <p>I asked Green what she makes of Christian nationalism, the newly ascendant ideology in the Republican Party. “I think sometimes when we talk about the Christian nationalism movement, we forget that concept of love,” Green said. “It doesn’t allow us to have the opportunity to respect other people or other people’s decisions. And so I do respect the fact that we were founded as a Christian nation, but Christianity is all about loving people. And so I want to bring that back.”</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Jennifer-Ruth Green Plays Defense</h3> <p><b>D</b>own the homestretch of the race, Democrats are trying to paint Green as an extremist on abortion, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXQFnd5wgN4&amp;t=12s\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665140726223,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf09-d5ef-ad97-bf7d2ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665140726223,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf09-d5ef-ad97-bf7d2ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXQFnd5wgN4&amp;t=12s&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b21f-d824-a1d7-b73f09aa0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;running an ad highlighting her no-exceptions stance&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-b21f-d824-a1d7-b73f09aa0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">running an ad highlighting her no-exceptions stance</a> — “Not even if a woman’s life is at risk.

I feel more calm,” she said, as she banked the plane east, making a big circle over the airport. She wore a black and green Jennifer-Ruth Green for Congress polo, a jean skirt, and black and white Chuck Taylor All-Star low tops. She was unwinding from a long day on the campaign trail, with no destination in particular — a rare moment for a hard-charging candidate.\n Flying is key to Green’s still-evolving political brand. In one ad, she stands in front of a plane, wearing a green civilian flight suit with Civil Air Patrol and Tuskegee Airmen badges sewn on. “I’m not just a pilot,” she says, “or a combat veteran. I’m Jennifer-Ruth Green.” In another ad, she poses in front of a fighter jet with the at-risk kids she mentors in her faith-based, non-profit organization, MissionAero, aimed at introducing youth to careers in the aerospace industry.\n The sun dipped in the sky. Green looked out of the pilot-side window and pointed to the steel mills that dotted the landscape of this corner of Northwest Indiana, farmland, and the Chicago skyline beyond on the western border of her district’s boundaries. The district includes U.S. Steel’s Gary Works, the largest steel mill in the nation, situated in Gary, a hollowed-out Rust Belt city. Economic refugees who have fled Illinois seeking Indiana’s friendlier tax climate have made this district more competitive in recent cycles, she said.\n “It’s such an incredibly diverse district,” said Green, who identifies as Black and Asian. “The majority of the district is blue-collar workers who take care of their bills and take care of their families — the middle 80 percent of the country. You don’t have granola bars or tree huggers. Everybody sits in this happy middle.”\n   \n The political mood on the ground might not be quite as cheerful. There’s an unexpected amount of drama for a district that hasn’t voted for a Republican in 92 years. Green, 40, is locked in one of the nation’s most competitive congressional races against freshman Democratic incumbent Rep. Frank Mrvan. POLITICO rates the race as leaning Democratic. But Green has made it competitive by posting record fundraising numbers — she raised $1.3 million in the third quarter, which positions her to likely outraise Mrvan for the second straight quarter. It’s not just her unique story that has made her a formidable challenger, but the ways and places in which she tells it: She’s become something of a regular on Fox News, a Black messenger who is a useful soldier in the culture wars for Republicans.\n “I wholeheartedly disagree that every system is inherently racist,” she said of critical race theory on Fox & Friends in July, “because if it were, I would not have had the opportunity of becoming a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and the Indiana National Guard … And so I’m exhibit A, and a rejection of the notion that CRT is a thought process that is worth continuing to provide to our K-12 children.”\n Green stands out even in a year when a historic group of 133 Black women are vying for spots in the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the 26 Black women in Congress, all are Democrats. Of the Republicans running in the 47 most vulnerable Democratic districts, 38 percent are military veterans, according to the Cook Political Report. Thirty-four percent are women. Twenty-three percent are non-white. Seventy percent are at least one of those things. Green is all three, just one of two candidates on the ballot this November to hold such a distinction. (Anna Paulina Luna, a fellow Air Force vet, who is Hispanic, is running in Florida’s 13th District.)\n Green recognizes the rarity of being a Black woman and conservative — something she recalls having an awareness of early in life. “There was a point I remember thinking that it was us, the Powells and the Rices who were the only Black Republicans in the country,” she said, referring to the two former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. When she announced her congressional bid last year, many friends and students who take flight lessons from her expressed “consternation” about her party affiliation.\n \n  \n She does not sound like a Powell or Rice, though. She has decried what she calls “woke madness” and equated abortion to eugenics against Black people, tweeting that “more Black babies are aborted than born in New York City.” In the wake of Dobbs, her position on abortion is going to make it harder for her to close the gap on Mrvan. Hoosier and national Democrats have hammered her anti-abortion rights stance, and her campaign privately fears the court’s decision could keep the district out of reach for Republicans.\n Now, starting her descent back to the Griffith airfield, Green refocused on the flight plan. “Take off and landing are the most accident-prone times,” she said.\n A month out until the election, Green is readying for her political landing. The Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund has booked $2.85 million in ads through Election Day. The Democratic House Majority PAC, meanwhile, has spent or booked a total of $2.56 million to attack Green. Green’s been in a war zone before.\n “Like butter,” she said, as eased the plane down in the summer heat.\n Jennifer-Ruth Green Reports for Duty\n A self-described “military brat” in a family of six, Green grew up in Long Beach, California and Sacramento where her father, an Air Force senior master sergeant, was stationed.\n Her father studied Russian, and her mother, a native of the Philippines who spoke Tagalog, wanted their children to learn another language but couldn’t find a Russian school in the area, Green said. “So four of us went to Japanese school” — every Saturday, from second to 10th grade. Later, she would pick up Spanish, French and Tagalog.\n When she was in kindergarten, her mother went back into the medical field, and so her father watched her after school. “We’d come home and we’d have two hours and it would be either 30 minutes of rest, 30 minutes of piano practice, 30 minutes of chores, 30 minutes of just reading,” Green said. “And then after that, we could all have dinner” — but while giving a 5-minute brief of whatever they had just read. Whoever won pocketed a dollar bill.\n Green attended the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in 2005 as one of just 15 Black female cadets in a class of 919. Her intention was to become a pilot but she didn’t pass her flight training, according to military records, and transferred into special investigations, which “identifies, investigates and neutralizes criminal, terrorist and espionage threats.” By 2009, she was a captain stationed in Iraq, part of a unit responsible for turning over the provisional government to the Iraqis. “It was a treacherous time,” she said.\n Her job, in part, was to conduct site visits at the national training center, Iraq’s FBI equivalent, evaluating their facilities and law enforcement curriculum. Her military evaluations praised her for evaluating 24 Iraqi intel course syllabi, something that expedited “curriculum development by months” and “professionalized agent training.” She “personally advised [the] Iraqi equivalent of [the] FBI Academy Director,” according to military records obtained by POLITICO.\n   \n Green’s mostly stellar military record took an unexpected hit in early 2010, according to military records. In an evaluation of her performance spanning from March 15, 2009 to Dec. 15, 2009, she received a “does not meet standards” rating in leadership skills, professional qualities, and judgment and decisions. The evaluation centered on “two instances of lacking judgment while deployed; handling your weapon and wandering away while at a [forward operating base].”\n In the first case, she was given a letter of counseling for loading her weapon inside a military facility. The second more serious incident occurred in September, according to her military records, when she and a small group of officers visited the national training center. She left the group to climb into a cramped guard tower where Green says an Iraqi serviceman sexually assaulted her by grabbing her breast and exposing himself.\n She said she was advised not to report the assault by a staff sergeant, who was also a military equal opportunity representative. He told her that “if American leadership complained to Iraqi leadership, they would continue to see women as liabilities and limit their ability to serve….”\n The poor evaluation, which was performed by someone who was not in Iraq with Green, affected her ability to rise in the ranks and in 2012 she was removed from active duty as part of a larger force reduction, according to her records. Green has appealed the evaluation, citing supporting letters from her superiors stationed in Iraq. Her direct supervisor, a senior agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, wrote in her appeal that she “did an outstanding job in her duties; I did not question her leadership, judgment or professional skills.”\n In 2017, she joined the Indiana Air National Guard. She now serves as a lieutenant colonel and commander and chief information officer. She has received consistently high evaluations.\n “I’m a survivor of sexual trauma in the military, and I am being forced to discuss it publicly for the first time because Congressman Mrvan or his supporters obtained — either illegally or by egregious error — military records describing my sexual assault as well as performance reviews, and peddled those records to the media with the intent smear me and my military career,” she wrote in a statement to POLITICO. “The performance review being pushed to discredit my leadership is false.” (Green has not contested the authenticity of the documents, which were obtained by a public records request and provided to POLITICO by a person outside the Mrvan campaign.)\n “After reporting my assault against the advice of officials in my command, my career was intentionally derailed. I appealed the findings with the military and the issue is settled. I have unquestionably progressed as a military member, promoting to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and successfully completed a command tour,” Green wrote in her statement to POLITICO. “As I have always, I will move forward and succeed despite obstacles such as this thrown in my path.”\n A Department of the Air Force spokesman said: “We remain committed to building a culture of respect, where sexual assault and harassment are not tolerated in any form and we will do this by supporting victims and prosecuting offenders through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.”\n  \nJennifer-Ruth Green Watches the State of the Union\n Green settled in to watch the State of the Union in February 2020 on her couch. She watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tear up the pages of the president’s address.\n “It was a visceral gut reaction. I just felt sick to my stomach,” Green said. Not long after, the political novice decided to run for Congress.\n “The third most powerful person in the country, knew that for her to have applause, and to have people write a headline about her was more important than making sure that our adversaries didn’t see instability, just led me to believe that there’s a great failure there,” she said.\n I asked her if what happened a year later on Jan. 6 was perhaps more egregious in terms of demonstrating instability to our enemies.\n “I would say they would feel that it would be a source of instability as well,” Green said, though with notably less enthusiasm.\n \n  \n Green entered early into what would become a crowded primary field.\n In May, Green won her seven-way primary by figuratively hugging Donald Trump, and criticizing her most prominent opponent, Blair Milo, for not attending the 2016 Republican Convention. Milo, the former mayor of LaPorte and a Navy veteran, was the only person in the field who had previously won elected office. In one ad she called Milo a “Never-Trump Liberal,” criticizing her for having reservations about attending the GOP convention in 2016. Now, Green is distancing herself from Trump. “President Trump was just very, very vocal in his style of leadership,” Green says now. “And his personality was not something that I want to emulate.”\n Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, former ambassador to the United Nations and potential presidential 2024 candidate, arrived in town recently to fundraise for Green, netting her another $20,000 or so as she continues to outraise her Democratic challenger. A few weeks earlier, Green pumped discounted gas alongside former Vice President Mike Pence. The last Republican who ran in this district spent only $14,000 and lost by 16 points. Green racked up more than that in one event, a signal that she is a different kind of GOP candidate.\n Jennifer-Ruth Green in Brazil\n “I’m going to pray for dinner,” Green said, a bacon, cheese and potato omelette and Coke before her at Mi Tierra, a Mexican restaurant at the airport in Griffith. “Dear Lord, thank you very much for this food. Thank you very much for the safety. God, I ask that this food would be blessed to our bodies and help us get back safely to our homes tonight.”\n Green’s favorite character is Barnabas, a “minister of missionaries,” she says, who helped the Apostle Paul spread the Gospel. She was inspired to get her pilot’s instructor certification in 2015 while on a mission trip in Brazil, where there was a need for pilots to fly into the Amazon.\n Green sees herself as a political missionary, a cultural translator who can bridge the divide between Republicans and minority communities on issues like the social safety net.\n “I think when we talk about welfare programs, we just can’t have people who get a job and then all of a sudden you’re cut off entirely,” Green said. “That’s just not an incentive and it’s more debilitating than it is helpful.” On this issue, Green presents herself as a moderate Republican — making her a better fit for a Democratic district.\n \n  \n Mia Love, the former Black Utah Republican congresswoman, said Green’s hopes to lead such an effort could meet resistance if elected. “What she thinks and what the reality she is going to find are vastly different, because there are people that are in Washington who have seniority and committees that will lead on those issues, when in reality, she might be the right messenger,” Love said.\n I asked Green what she makes of Christian nationalism, the newly ascendant ideology in the Republican Party. “I think sometimes when we talk about the Christian nationalism movement, we forget that concept of love,” Green said. “It doesn’t allow us to have the opportunity to respect other people or other people’s decisions. And so I do respect the fact that we were founded as a Christian nation, but Christianity is all about loving people. And so I want to bring that back.”\n Jennifer-Ruth Green Plays Defense\n Down the homestretch of the race, Democrats are trying to paint Green as an extremist on abortion, running an ad highlighting her no-exceptions stance — “Not even if a woman’s life is at risk. Not even if she is raped. Not even if the victim is a 10-year-old little girl,” the narrator says. The ad refers to the horrific and headline-grabbing case of an Ohio native forced to cross the state line to receive an abortion in Indiana after the Dobbs ruling. It’s a case that imbued the Indiana’s legislative session — the first one convened in a special session following the court’s overturning of Roe — with a tense emotional energy.\n On this day, Indiana’s new abortion law, among the most restrictive in the nation — with narrow exceptions for rape and incest through 10 weeks — took effect. “I support the legislation,” Green said. “I’m pro-life and I believe that people can disagree on this issue. At the national level, the federal level, I would wholeheartedly support a 15-week ban, late-term abortion ban with exceptions of life of the mother, rape and incest.” In other words, she endorses Lindsey Graham’s abortion ban proposal, which comes as she’s getting hammered in this traditionally Democratic district over her anti-abortion stance.\n \n  \n And what did she make of the 10-year-old’s case? “That’s a really difficult situation. I feel very bad for victims of sexual assault,” Green said. “My heart grieves for that. And I think, you know, Indiana has exceptions for those kinds of cases.”\n Green isn’t conceding political defeat and insists all the pressure is on her opponent Mrvan.\n “The military has taught me that I value good ideas,” Green said. “So I don’t care where they come from. And at the end of the day, if they just say, ‘Jennifer is a thoughtful leader of character,’ then I’ll be happy with that.”","dc:creator":"Adam Wren","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/39/46/7aa2ffc34ecba29646683b134d5b/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary2.jpg"},"media:title":[{"_":"Jennifer-Ruth Green stands on top of her airplane for a portrait at the Griffith-Merrillville Airport in Griffith, Ind. on Sept. 15, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/39/46/7aa2ffc34ecba29646683b134d5b/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary2.jpg"}}]},"content":"This Black conservative woman has a shot to flip a seat in Indiana that has voted Democratic for nearly a century.","contentSnippet":"This Black conservative woman has a shot to flip a seat in Indiana that has voted Democratic for nearly a century.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/07/shes-black-and-conservative-in-a-democratic-district-is-she-about-to-take-off-politically-00060703","isoDate":"2022-10-07T12:00:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Los Angeles Times staff","title":"Your guide to Proposition 1 on the 2022 California midterm ballot","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-06/2022-california-election-voter-guide-proposition-1-abortion","pubDate":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 00:01:13 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>California voters will decide the fate of seven statewide propositions on Nov. 8.

At the end of the day, the case against him boils down to the criticism that he will allow too much unfettered speech on his social media platform, a plaint that would have made little sense to anyone a decade or so ago when the balance of center-left opinion was still robustly free speech.\n As it is, a libertarian-ish business leader is saying he wants an important platform for political and social advocacy and argument to provide the widest possible latitude for varied, clashing views, and the reaction of a large segment of commentators is, “This man must be stopped.”\n Musk can’t catch a break. Bill Clinton’s former Labor Secretary Robert Reich tweeted, “When multi-billionaires take control of our most vital platforms for communication, it’s not a win for free speech.

And the morning after, on his 50th birthday, he rallied with supporters at the University of Texas at Austin. They wore T-shirts that said “Beto for Texas” or “Beto for Y’all,” and four of them spelled out “BETO” in blue and white paint on their shirtless chests. They gave O’Rourke a cupcake and sang “Happy Birthday.” They stood in line to take photographs with him and to shake his hand, and they rang cowbells.</p> <p>Yet if Texas Democrats adore O’Rourke as much as they did in 2018, the experience of his last two elections is now tempering their expectations.</p> <p>Four years ago, when O’Rourke captivated Democrats with his Senate run against <a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/175665\" data-person-id=\"175665\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1664899205333,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1664899205333,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\\&quot;identifier\\&quot;:\\&quot;175665\\&quot;,\\&quot;url\\&quot;:\\&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/175665\\&quot;,\\&quot;preferredName\\&quot;:\\&quot;Sen.

Zion Church, the Rev. Gaylon Clark introduced Beto O’Rourke to his congregation one recent Sunday as “the next governor of the state of Texas.” Then he raised his hand and, over the strains of a keyboard, prayed for “victory in the name of Jesus.”\n In the sanctuary, the churchgoers said, “Amen.” In the lobby, they lined up for pictures with the one-time Democratic sensation now lagging in the polls.\n “With God and faith and him being here today,” one of the congregants told me, “you should see a change in his numbers by next week.” Another suspected polls were missing voters who are tired of the state’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, but reluctant to acknowledge voting for a Democrat — the kind of “shy” voter theory once applied by some observers to Donald Trump. A woman said she could see people “waking up” in Texas, while her 7-year-old daughter, who O’Rourke bent low to speak with, told me O’Rourke addressed not only her concerns about school, but also the protection of ocelots.\n It was the kind of gusher of hopefulness that O’Rourke — at his boisterous rallies, in his prolific, small-dollar fundraising, trucking across Texas — has met with ever since he burst into the national consciousness in his U.S. Senate run in 2018 and continued to inspire among Democrats in the early stages of his presidential campaign two years later.\n But even here in Democratic-heavy Austin — even to many of O’Rourke’s supporters — it is looking more and more like it may not add up to enough.\n In other states, ever since the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in June, Democrats have been performing better than expected — in the rejection of an anti-abortion rights ballot measure in Kansas and in special congressional elections in Nebraska, Minnesota and New York. President Joe Biden’s public approval ratings have ticked up. But if the political winds of a post-Roe summer were lifting Democrats elsewhere, they do not appear to be blowing into Texas.\n In a survey released in mid-September by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler, O’Rourke was running 9 percentage points behind Abbott in the race for governor. A University of Texas/Texas Project poll put the margin at 5 points. A few days after the church service, O’Rourke’s deficit registered in a Quinnipiac University poll at 7 points.\n Those aren’t encouraging numbers for O’Rourke. And the top lines aren’t even the worst of it. In their lone debate, in an empty studio on Friday night, O’Rourke cast Abbott as “extreme” on abortion rights and as a “failure” on immigration and in his response to the school shooting in Uvalde in May. But when pollsters asked voters recently what mattered to them most, it was as though Texas hadn’t changed at all. Immigration and border security — not abortion or gun violence — ranked first. And on immigration, Texans trusted Abbott over O’Rourke by double-digit margins.\n Abbott’s controversial busing of migrants out of state? A majority of Texas voters support it.\n “Near as we can tell,” said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, “the things that made the summer look good for Democrats and lead us to ask perhaps why isn’t this race tighter — they’ve proven to be a little more ephemeral and not able to disrupt what is the basic pattern of politics in Texas.”\n “The narrative in my mind is, we spent the summer talking about abortion, looking at the unending string of bad news and bad responses to Uvalde, and the difficulty that Abbott and his team had handling or not handling that,” Henson said.\n At least in the polling, it didn’t appear to stick. “What seemed like an apparent, potential shift in the issue agenda for the election,” Henson said, “seems to have not taken hold.”\n At the church, O’Rourke lingered until the line of photo-seekers was gone. And the morning after, on his 50th birthday, he rallied with supporters at the University of Texas at Austin. They wore T-shirts that said “Beto for Texas” or “Beto for Y’all,” and four of them spelled out “BETO” in blue and white paint on their shirtless chests. They gave O’Rourke a cupcake and sang “Happy Birthday.” They stood in line to take photographs with him and to shake his hand, and they rang cowbells.\n Yet if Texas Democrats adore O’Rourke as much as they did in 2018, the experience of his last two elections is now tempering their expectations.\n Four years ago, when O’Rourke captivated Democrats with his Senate run against Ted Cruz, his near-miss represented the promise the state’s shifting demographics could have for the party, with a younger and more diverse electorate verging on turning the nation’s second-most populous state blue. But then came 2020. Donald Trump carried the state by nearly 6 percentage points while over-performing in the heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley. Democrats in Texas failed to make gains down ballot after picking up state house seats in 2018, while O’Rourke’s presidential campaign imploded.\n “In government [class], we learn how to calculate if a candidate will win,” Suly Ramirez-Hernandez, a student at the University of Texas at Austin rally, told me.\n It was an imperfect kind of calculation, based in part on past performance. She said she hadn’t done it for O’Rourke: “I’m scared it might not come back how I want it to.”\n \n  \n  \nO’Rourke isn’t out of the race yet, and it’s not as though Texas looks worse for Democrats than before. Yes, Trump did better with Latinos in 2020 than he had in 2016. But he wasn’t winning them in Texas, or winning over young voters, either. As that segment of the electorate grows, Democrats here still appear likely to benefit.\n At the Texas Tribune Festival in late September, on a panel introduced as featuring “the Democrats running for office at the top of the ticket who are not Beto O’Rourke,” Mike Collier, a Democrat running for a second time against Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, expressed hope in that future.\n “We will win,” Collier said. “It’s just a question of time. It’s a question of when.”\n On the Democratic ticket with O’Rourke, Collier, a former Republican, has been courting Republicans, while Rochelle Garza, a former lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who is running against Texas’ scandal-plagued attorney general, Ken Paxton, is emphasizing abortion rights. Jay Kleberg, who is running for land commissioner — a relatively low-information race — has been on a tour of dance halls, telling people about the office and his experience in conservation.\n \n When I met with Kleberg, a friend of O’Rourke’s, in Austin recently, he said he sensed a greater openness in Texas to voting Democratic than in 2018, after last year’s deadly winter storm and electrical grid failure, and after Uvalde.\n “I just think people are looking for competency,” he said, “and I don’t know that that was necessarily the sentiment in 2018.”\n He said, “I know that it’s harder to find in that data, but I just feel a tiredness in Texans, that they are tired of being promised things and being represented by people who ultimately, I believe, don’t share their core values.”\n He could be right. No one expected the anti-abortion rights ballot measure in Kansas, a reliably red state, to lose by as much as it did this year, and Democratic modeling in Texas suggests younger, Democratic-leaning voters have been making up a larger share of new voter registrants following the decision on Roe.\n What Kleberg and every other Democrat in Texas really needs, though, is for the Democrat at the top of the ticket, O’Rourke, to turn those younger voters and people of color out, which explains why O’Rourke was attending a predominately Black church on Sunday, and, the next morning, putting on an orange Texas Longhorns hat to begin a tour of the state’s college campuses.\n \n  \n “At every major turn of this country’s history — Lexington, Concord, Appomattox, Selma in 1965 — it hasn’t been old fogeys who are 50 years old who make this work,” O’Rourke told the students. “It has been the young people who have the urgency of this moment and are doing whatever it takes by any means necessary to make sure that we come through.”\n O’Rourke, who along with other Democrats had been aggressively registering voters in the run-up to the gubernatorial campaign, pointed students to a voter registration tent at the rally to sign up.\n “Young people, students like those who are here right now, are literally going to decide the outcome of this election,” O’Rourke told reporters.\n But if that’s true, progress is incremental.\n He said, “I think we got 89 voter registrations just at this event.”\n In the crowd, Jacinda Navarro, an 18-year-old freshman from San Antonio, said she could see Texas changing “in the next five to 10 years, if not now.” But she isn’t sure it’s there yet.\n “Democrats are loud on social media,” she said. “But conservatives, there are a lot of them.”\n \n  \n  \nNearly everything O’Rourke is doing — the non-stop tours, the crowds, the viral indignation — is reminiscent of his previous runs (though, to the relief of many Democrats, he appeared to take a more aggressive posture against Abbott than he initially did Cruz). The former congressman from El Paso also finds himself, once again, compelled to persuade voters that he still can win.\n It’s not an unimportant case to make — significant to donors, volunteers and for keeping prospective voters enthused. And some people have already given up on him.\n “You only have a certain amount of time to be the ‘It’ guy or ‘It’ girl or whatever it is, and then people start chipping away,” one major Democratic donor in the state told me. “Now he’s coming back for Round 3, and it’s like, can you really get that excited?”\n He said, “Democrats are excited to get rid of Abbott, but the fact is there are more Republicans in the state still.”\n O’Rourke, asked about the state of the race during an on-stage interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in late September, offered the banal refrain of trailing candidates everywhere: “As anyone who’s asked this question whose polling is not where they want it to be would say, ‘The only poll that matters is the one that we take on Election Day.’”\n But he also had a more incisive argument about his prospects and public opinion polls. Respectable surveys four years ago put O’Rourke behind Cruz by a much wider margin than he ultimately lost by, less than 3 percentage points.\n He told reporters in Austin that voters are “just beginning to pay attention to this race,” and that while Abbott has been pummeling him on TV, he has only recently started to advertise.\n “I think it’s still early,” said Marc Veasey, a Democratic congressman from Texas. “I think he’s got it.”\n Julie Oliver, who twice ran unsuccessfully to flip a Republican-held House seat around Austin, said, “I think there’s never been a more opportune moment than now … I do, with my whole heart, believe he can win.”\n This may be O’Rourke’s last chance. With his near-universal name recognition and an army of small donors, O’Rourke had widely been viewed in Texas as the Democrats’ best hope of defeating Abbott, and he had been lobbied heavily by Texas Democrats to get into the race. But given the conservative bent of the state, it was always going to be a longshot.\n Still, if O’Rourke falls short, he will be a three-time loser — a difficult, if not impossible, brand to overcome.\n Dave Carney, the Republican strategist who advises Abbott, said, “If he loses again, that’s it.”\n \n  \n At the church in Austin, O’Rourke bowed his head while Clark, the pastor, prayed. In the parking lot, O’Rourke told me he was moved by the message at the service that, “You’ve got to be able to say ‘Yes,’ even when it’s hard.”\n He’d been studying the stories of “great Texans who have done extraordinary things against incredible odds,” he said, including Lawrence Nixon, the civil rights leader from El Paso who features prominently in O’Rourke’s campaign speeches and in a book about voting rights he wrote this year.\n “The greatest challenges are found in Texas, but the greatest people who have the strength and power and dedication to overcome these challenges are found in Texas, as well,” O’Rourke said. “And I think that’s a lesson worth remembering at this moment.”\n Inside the church, Clark was walking to the door. He told me he was as hopeful as anyone here that this could be the year for O’Rourke. But he wasn’t sure what to expect in November.\n “The issues are so complex right now, I don’t know how people are feeling,” he said.\n He recalled that he’d been optimistic when O’Rourke ran for Senate, too, and lost. The explanation wasn’t complicated.\n “You’re in Texas,” he said.","dc:creator":"David Siders","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/ba/b6/a1b12c994891ad0e6d3c767b1358/fifty.Siders.Beto.lead.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Brandon Bell/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke finds himself once again compelled to persuade voters that he still can win.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/ba/b6/a1b12c994891ad0e6d3c767b1358/fifty.Siders.Beto.lead.jpg"}}]},"content":"The former congressman and Democratic sensation is still trying to prove he can win statewide in his home state.","contentSnippet":"The former congressman and Democratic sensation is still trying to prove he can win statewide in his home state.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/05/beto-orourke-texas-governor-election-00060060","isoDate":"2022-10-05T08:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"Ex-grad student held in Arizona professor's fatal shooting","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/ex-grad-student-held-arizona-211756262.html","pubDate":"2022-10-07T21:17:56Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RKn6sEOYUZOq6s3PbQ7mlQ--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/b51990740fc7f17ea7f1995406665e25","width":"130"}},"guid":"ex-grad-student-held-arizona-211756262.html","isoDate":"2022-10-07T21:17:56.000Z"},{"title":"A man is accused of breaking the bathroom door on a United Airlines flight and attacking a flight attendant while high on magic mushrooms","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/man-accused-breaking-bathroom-door-170100977.html","pubDate":"2022-10-09T17:01:00Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MCR1kb23FIzuxnAXzJ6OAA--~B/aD0xMDEwO3c9MTM0ODthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insider_articles_922/8d0f6e26c3c96f472878e8e9e9a272bd","width":"130"}},"guid":"man-accused-breaking-bathroom-door-170100977.html","isoDate":"2022-10-09T17:01:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Mark Z.

Members need a simple majority to win, but if no candidate receives a majority in a three-way race, then the lowest person drops out and the panel goes to the second ballot.

The Steering panel makeup will adjust as Republicans look to replace the seats of at least three retiring members and fill new regional representative seats, which will be impacted by where Republicans win seats in the midterms.

Leaking such comments in order to publicly suggest it was genuine support felt like a “gotcha” moment, according to some frustrated Steering members.</p> <p>“I don't believe that information should be made public,” said Jason Smith, calling it the “worst thing” to do in such a race. “And it definitely should not be put to the press to try to help promote or push a certain agenda or candidate. And when that happens, it does backfire.”</p> <p>Buchanan’s office declined an interview request for this story, as the Floridian’s state was grappling with Hurricane Ian. In a statement provided to POLITICO, he said he was focused on Republicans taking back the House next year.</p> <p>That’s not to say Buchanan doesn’t still have his supporters. The Sarasotan comes from a blue-collar background but built up a net worth that exceeds $100 million. He lives in an area and a state that is primed for thick-pocketed donors. And he has delivered on his dollars.</p> <p>Buchanan leads the other candidates in terms of fundraising, giving House Republicans’ campaign arm $3.1 million this cycle as well as over $320,000 to members and candidates. Jason Smith, who has vowed to match Buchanan, follows him with $2.5 million to the NRCC as well as $620,000 for members and candidates this cycle.

Jason Smith (R-Mo.) has gained ground. He’s aggressively working members of the House Steering Committee — who will decide who gets the plum position — and touting higher fundraising numbers.\n POLITICO spoke to more than two dozen of the current members of the roughly 30-member committee about who they support, granting anonymity so lawmakers could speak frankly. That vote tally shows the three-way race has no guaranteed winner; one Steering member said the dynamics have “shifted significantly.” Though Rep. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.), who is known as more of a policy wonk, trails the other two.\n “We knew early on whenever we got in the race that no one had it locked up,” Jason Smith said in an interview. “And the reporting early on said that it was a lock for Vern and we knew that it wasn't, and I feel comfortable where we're at.”\n Among the members who were willing to answer, the results suggest Buchanan and Jason Smith will be going head-to-head, with three main groups in the mix: Buchanan supporters, anti-Buchanan voters and those who are still undecided or declining to answer.\n \n  \n The voting process itself could easily work against Buchanan. Members need a simple majority to win, but if no candidate receives a majority in a three-way race, then the lowest person drops out and the panel goes to the second ballot. A handful of Steering members said they are supporting “one of the Smiths,” while others said they were backing Adrian Smith but would shift support to Jason Smith if it went to a second ballot.\n However, there are some unknowns to consider that could shift the race to lead Ways and Means — which has jurisdiction over taxes and other revenue-raising measures — in anyone’s favor. The Steering panel makeup will adjust as Republicans look to replace the seats of at least three retiring members and fill new regional representative seats, which will be impacted by where Republicans win seats in the midterms. Plus, expected shuffling to House leadership will highly impact the committee.\n House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s vote will be decisive. If he wins the speakership, as expected, the GOP leader would then have four votes on Steering, whereas other members only have one, plus a designee that is expected to vote alongside him. At least two Steering members telegraphed to POLITICO that they would at least partially base their vote on McCarthy’s choice. And Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), a McCarthy ally who is expected to rise to majority leader with little to no trouble, will have two votes.\n \n  \n While cozying up to Steering members is a big part of the game, as well as fundraising, some Republicans felt Buchanan took it too far. His attempts to project confidence in the race have backfired among some members — the question is how much.\n Multiple lawmakers on the panel believe the Florida Republican’s team is behind leaked comments to a beltway newsletter that suggest Buchanan is the future chair. That’s including a recent one from National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), as well as some from McCarthy himself and Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), the Republican Study Committee chair.\n Steering members don’t deny that McCarthy and company made the comments, but they argue those statements of support are typically trotted out to encourage GOP donors to pull out their wallets. Leaking such comments in order to publicly suggest it was genuine support felt like a “gotcha” moment, according to some frustrated Steering members.\n “I don't believe that information should be made public,” said Jason Smith, calling it the “worst thing” to do in such a race. “And it definitely should not be put to the press to try to help promote or push a certain agenda or candidate. And when that happens, it does backfire.”\n Buchanan’s office declined an interview request for this story, as the Floridian’s state was grappling with Hurricane Ian. In a statement provided to POLITICO, he said he was focused on Republicans taking back the House next year.\n That’s not to say Buchanan doesn’t still have his supporters. The Sarasotan comes from a blue-collar background but built up a net worth that exceeds $100 million. He lives in an area and a state that is primed for thick-pocketed donors. And he has delivered on his dollars.\n Buchanan leads the other candidates in terms of fundraising, giving House Republicans’ campaign arm $3.1 million this cycle as well as over $320,000 to members and candidates. Jason Smith, who has vowed to match Buchanan, follows him with $2.5 million to the NRCC as well as $620,000 for members and candidates this cycle. And Adrian Smith has elected to give $1.3 million directly to candidates and committees, rather than routing it through the NRCC.\n Buchanan also has the seniority argument on his side, holding every single subcommittee leadership role on the panel in his eight congressional terms — though he is tied in terms of time serving on the panel with Adrian Smith. And he enjoys the support of the only GOP Steering member who is publicly airing his vote plans.\n \n  \n “You tell me who's better than him as a candidate for that position,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly, who praised the other talent in the race. “I said, ‘You're the guy. I mean, I've checked everything you said about yourself. I've checked your resume. … You are exactly who you say you are.’”\n But members say you still can’t count out Jason Smith.

He was one of a handful who was stabbed during civil unrest at a Dec. 12, 2020, event — which he describes as the reason he wasn’t present on Jan. 6.\n Bertino was on an encrypted chat with other Proud Boys leaders, including Tarrio, in the weeks before Jan. 6, and he says in his plea documents that he believes the group’s plan “was to stop the certification of the Electoral College Vote” on Jan. 6, even if it involved “using force against police and others.”\n Hours after the attack on the Capitol, Bertino messaged Tarrio saying “You know we made this happen” and “1776 motherfucker.”","dc:creator":"Kyle Cheney","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/2b/ce/b11d252043e79ddca248338d8af6/20221006-proud-boys-jeremy-bertino-wc.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Anthony Crider via Wikimedia Commons","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Proud Boy Jeremy Bertino in Raleigh, N.C. on Nov. 28, 2020.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/2b/ce/b11d252043e79ddca248338d8af6/20221006-proud-boys-jeremy-bertino-wc.jpg"}}]},"content":"He's the first member of the group to admit to the charge stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.","contentSnippet":"He's the first member of the group to admit to the charge stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/06/proud-boys-leader-pleads-guilty-to-seditious-conspiracy-over-jan-6-actions-00060819","isoDate":"2022-10-06T19:56:38.000Z"},{"creator":"Richard Winton, James Queally","title":"Hollywood producer Eric Weinberg arrested again after D.A. files 18 sex abuse and assault charges ","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-04/hollywood-producer-eric-weinberg-arrested-again-after-da-files-18-sex-and-assault-charges","pubDate":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 06:39:47 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Eric Weinberg is back in custody after L.A.

Trump's home. This is unprecedented!,” read an Aug. 10 advertisement on Google from the Republican National Committee that doubled as a fundraising appeal.</p> <p>Democrats, for their part, are mostly sticking to ads about abortion — which remained the most frequently mentioned issue several months after the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v. Wade </i>— along with other kitchen-table issues, such as jobs and the economy. A few dozen ads that ran since the Mar-a-Lago search reference the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

Abortion and the economy-related ads are dominating in swing districts, according to the advertising data.\n The statistic highlights an essential reality about Trump's legal troubles. For as much as the multiple investigations closing in on the former president rivet avid consumers of political news, campaigns aren’t yet using it in competitive races around the country. Instead, both parties are harnessing it for appeals to their respective bases. \n “Obviously there are a lot of concerns with the president's conduct. But this election is about putting people over politics, about what we've achieved for the American people and what's left to do, and the Republicans’ obsession with power and failure to put forward a plan,” Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs House Democrats’ campaign arm, said in a brief interview. \n The handful of ads that do mention Trump's legal quagmire come largely from Republicans and conservative outside groups criticizing what they see as DOJ overreach, not from vulnerable Republicans in swing seats.\n \n \n “Biden's FBI raids Pres. Trump's home. This is unprecedented!,” read an Aug. 10 advertisement on Google from the Republican National Committee that doubled as a fundraising appeal.\n Democrats, for their part, are mostly sticking to ads about abortion — which remained the most frequently mentioned issue several months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — along with other kitchen-table issues, such as jobs and the economy. A few dozen ads that ran since the Mar-a-Lago search reference the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. A recent ad from Wisconsin Democrat Brad Pfaff criticized his Republican opponent Derrick Van Orden for being at the Capitol on Jan. 6, for example. \n But the former president’s more recent legal woes rank near the bottom of campaign-ad themes: There were even more Democratic ads that mention bipartisanship than the DOJ probe of Trump.\n The limited Democratic ads that have mentioned his legal struggles appear largely targeted at list-building and attracting donations. The farthest-reaching Democratic ad that touched on the matter came from the party's Senate campaign arm and started running on Sep. 15. It asked social media users if Trump should “be held accountable” and presented a laundry list of the legal drama surrounding the former president, costing just over $20,000.\n Beyond the ad-war silence over Trump's handling of classified documents, neither Republicans nor Democrats have spent on recent messaging related to New York Attorney General Tish James’ recent lawsuit against Trump and his adult children, accusing them of fraudulent financial practices at the former president’s businesses.\n \n It’s just not something resonating in swing districts, according to one vulnerable House Democrat.\n “While it may be red meat in some areas, it is not red meat in a Trump-voting district,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who's running for reelection in a redrawn district won by Trump in 2016 and Biden narrowly in 2020. “And I don't think we should approach it as a political issue.

Former football star and Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker has been credibly accused of behavior involving all three.</p> <p>Yet Walker is not facing outrage from the right. To the contrary, his conservative backers are closing ranks behind him. Why?</p> <p>The obvious explanation is that the stakes for Republicans are too high, and it’s too close to Election Day for an about-face. But the simple answer is too simple. It seems evident that many conservatives are not forcibly suppressing revulsion over Walker’s behavior. They don’t actually feel it. At a minimum, their disdain for his alleged transgressions is mild compared to their disdain toward those who hope to exploit those transgressions on behalf of liberals.</p> <p>As it happens, Walker is drawing support from the same phenomenon — sexual values as a primary battleground in the fight for power — that is at work in multiple arenas around the world.</p> <p>From Moscow to Atlanta, from Rome to Beijing, there are versions of the same question when it comes to prevailing sexual standards: Which side are you on? In all these venues, it seems evident that purported traditionalists are not rigid about defending traditional sexual <i>morality</i>. In their own bedroom, or even (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/herschel-walker-children.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;as apparently in Walker’s case&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/herschel-walker-children.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8280000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8280001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">as apparently in Walker’s case</a>) in itinerant adventures through many bedrooms, people will do whatever it is they do. What they are rigid about defending is traditional sexual <i>authority</i>. A world in which straight males hold power in both their private and public lives is good. A world in which authority is unharnessed from gender — and the notion that gender identity is fluid — is bad.</p> <p>In this contest, what animates the combatants is less what people choose to do with their sexuality in private than what they choose to say and celebrate about sexuality in public. In Walker’s case, what he says — he wants to ban all abortions — is more important than what he allegedly did. (He paid for a girlfriend’s abortion, according to the Daily Beast, which viewed the canceled check among other evidence. Walker denied the report.)</p> <p>The global character of the war over sex has been on especially vivid display in recent days. In his diatribe last week against what he sees as the enemies of Russia, Vladimir Putin took a detour from classical geopolitical matters and turned his caustic attention toward sex. In the United States and many parts of Europe, he said, cultures have <a href=\"https://consortiumnews.com/2022/09/30/text-of-putins-speech-blasting-neo-colonial-west/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“completely moved to a radical denial of moral norms, religion, and family.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://consortiumnews.com/2022/09/30/text-of-putins-speech-blasting-neo-colonial-west/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8280002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8280003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">“completely moved to a radical denial of moral norms, religion, and family.”</a></p> <p>Putin sarcastically challenged his fellow Russians, in language reminiscent of right-wing cable television: “Do we want to have, here, in our country, in Russia, instead of Mom and Dad, ‘parent number one,’ ‘number two,’ ‘number three.’ Are they completely crazy already there? Do we really want perversions that lead to degradation and extinction to be imposed on children in our schools from the primary grades? To be drummed into them that there are supposedly other genders besides women and men, and to be offered a sex change operation?”</p> <p>Putin’s speech came just after Italian politician Giorgia Meloni led her right-wing Brothers of Italy party to big gains, making her the likely next Prime Minister. She campaigned in favor of traditional families and against LGBTQ activists.

The early and middle decades of the 20th Century were marked by totalitarianism — fascism on the right, communism on the left. The post-World War II era was marked by anti-colonialism, with new nations springing up all over the world. The end of the Cold War produced a wave of ethnic nationalism, destroying multicultural countries like the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and even for a time threatening the unity of placid Canada.</p> <p>What is the<i> ism</i> driving right-wing movements in this age? Often it is described as anti-globalism, with its hostility toward free trade and immigration, and that is part of it. But there is another big part which deals less with material matters like job loss and more with the intimate realms of psychology and identity. This movement — anti-sexual liberationism is a bit of a mouthful — is what unifies Putin, Meloni, the supporters of Herschel Walker and many other people.</p> <p>It is a reactionary movement marked by all kinds of contradictions.

Former football star and Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker has been credibly accused of behavior involving all three.\n Yet Walker is not facing outrage from the right. To the contrary, his conservative backers are closing ranks behind him. Why?\n The obvious explanation is that the stakes for Republicans are too high, and it’s too close to Election Day for an about-face. But the simple answer is too simple. It seems evident that many conservatives are not forcibly suppressing revulsion over Walker’s behavior. They don’t actually feel it. At a minimum, their disdain for his alleged transgressions is mild compared to their disdain toward those who hope to exploit those transgressions on behalf of liberals.\n As it happens, Walker is drawing support from the same phenomenon — sexual values as a primary battleground in the fight for power — that is at work in multiple arenas around the world.\n From Moscow to Atlanta, from Rome to Beijing, there are versions of the same question when it comes to prevailing sexual standards: Which side are you on? In all these venues, it seems evident that purported traditionalists are not rigid about defending traditional sexual morality. In their own bedroom, or even (as apparently in Walker’s case) in itinerant adventures through many bedrooms, people will do whatever it is they do. What they are rigid about defending is traditional sexual authority. A world in which straight males hold power in both their private and public lives is good. A world in which authority is unharnessed from gender — and the notion that gender identity is fluid — is bad.\n In this contest, what animates the combatants is less what people choose to do with their sexuality in private than what they choose to say and celebrate about sexuality in public. In Walker’s case, what he says — he wants to ban all abortions — is more important than what he allegedly did. (He paid for a girlfriend’s abortion, according to the Daily Beast, which viewed the canceled check among other evidence. Walker denied the report.)\n The global character of the war over sex has been on especially vivid display in recent days. In his diatribe last week against what he sees as the enemies of Russia, Vladimir Putin took a detour from classical geopolitical matters and turned his caustic attention toward sex. In the United States and many parts of Europe, he said, cultures have “completely moved to a radical denial of moral norms, religion, and family.”\n Putin sarcastically challenged his fellow Russians, in language reminiscent of right-wing cable television: “Do we want to have, here, in our country, in Russia, instead of Mom and Dad, ‘parent number one,’ ‘number two,’ ‘number three.’ Are they completely crazy already there? Do we really want perversions that lead to degradation and extinction to be imposed on children in our schools from the primary grades? To be drummed into them that there are supposedly other genders besides women and men, and to be offered a sex change operation?”\n Putin’s speech came just after Italian politician Giorgia Meloni led her right-wing Brothers of Italy party to big gains, making her the likely next Prime Minister. She campaigned in favor of traditional families and against LGBTQ activists. She described her credo on sexual politics earlier this year: “Yes to natural families, no to the LGBT lobby, yes to sexual identity, no to gender ideology, yes to the culture of life, no to the abyss of death.”\n Consider also how Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime in Beijing has banned depictions of effeminate men on TV. Broadcasters must “resolutely put an end to sissy men and other abnormal aesthetics,” the official television regulatory agency declared.\n Or take my POLITICO colleague Florian Eder’s interview several months ago with German Green Party Marina Weisband, an émigré from Ukraine, as she tried to explain Putin’s appeal with his own people and in some parts of Eastern Europe. “When people talk about Europe, they always depict it as the decadent, gay Europe,” Weisband said, “where you can no longer distinguish between right and wrong and good and evil.” This echoed something a Bulgarian reform politician said to me in 2021, when I asked why so many people in that country identify with Russia and its values more than Western Europe. “People see Europe as gay,” this reformer said, making clear “gay” was not narrowly defined as same-sex relations but was shorthand broadly for sexual freedom, and the way it merges with a materialistic culture to erode traditional institutions of church and family.\n Anti-gay sentiments usually mingle easily with anti-feminist sentiments. Peter Beinart in The Atlantic in 2019 wrote that authoritarian regimes from Hungary to the Philippines and many other places “share one big thing…They all want to subordinate women.” Erika Chenoweth and Zoe Marks wrote in the February Foreign Affairs of the “Revenge of the Patriarchs.”\n Important historical movements tend to flow from “isms” — large ideas that manifest themselves in many places simultaneously. The early and middle decades of the 20th Century were marked by totalitarianism — fascism on the right, communism on the left. The post-World War II era was marked by anti-colonialism, with new nations springing up all over the world. The end of the Cold War produced a wave of ethnic nationalism, destroying multicultural countries like the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and even for a time threatening the unity of placid Canada.\n What is the ism driving right-wing movements in this age? Often it is described as anti-globalism, with its hostility toward free trade and immigration, and that is part of it. But there is another big part which deals less with material matters like job loss and more with the intimate realms of psychology and identity. This movement — anti-sexual liberationism is a bit of a mouthful — is what unifies Putin, Meloni, the supporters of Herschel Walker and many other people.\n It is a reactionary movement marked by all kinds of contradictions. Putin poses shirtless and boasts of masculine virtues, but he is losing a war in Ukraine, which is supported by the very western nations he usually denounces as weak and emasculated. Walker, with his children from multiple relationships and reports of violent behavior in his past, is hardly the perfect ambassador for campaign to ban abortion or elevate traditional families. Even so, conservative commentator Dana Loesch said of the abortion allegation on The First: “Does this change anything? Not a damn thing.”\n She added: “If The Daily Beast's story is true, you're telling me Walker used his money to reportedly pay some skank for an abortion, and [Democratic opponent Raphael] Warnock wants to use all of our moneys to pay [a] bunch of skanks for abortion.”\n Walker’s behavior, for supporters and opponents alike, turns out to be an effective vehicle to get back to the familiar question: Which side are you on?","dc:creator":"John F.

The courthouse was a hive of supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, one of whom cursed Fanone in the courtroom, another of whom shouted at him about a conspiracy theory as he stepped away from the building. As we made our way down Pennsylvania Avenue, a man followed us, videotaping from his phone the entire time.</p> <p>Fanone, a ubiquitous TV presence since suffering a traumatic brain injury and a heart attack as a result of the assault, is accustomed to the snarling randos. They’ve shown up at his house and the homes of his mom, dad and ex-wife; they’ve made the onetime Donald Trump voter and self-described “redneck cop” afraid of what might happen to him in the isolated rural hunting redoubt that used to be his “safe place” away from the life of an urban vice officer. But when his take-no-prisoners memoir about his experience lands next week, the main targets of his scorn won’t be the random extremists ranting on sidewalks and raving on Telegram. Instead, he’s taking swings at the bigwigs who Fanone says have sought to sweep Jan. 6 under the rug.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/61/bc/45cba98644489db71492a9fb6361/ap22276816965968.jpg\"> <br> <p>The average score-settling memoir is apt to devolve into a he-said/she-said news cycle.

Other conversations, with people such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, weren’t recorded but are recounted in cringey detail.<br></p> <br> <p>Thus we see McCarthy, finally taking a meeting with Fanone, fellow Jan. 6 hero Harry Dunn, and the mother of late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, lamely try to run out the clock on their conversation. We see Graham snap at Gladys Sicknick that “we’re going to end the meeting right now” if she keeps speaking ill of Trump. And we see Yoes telling Fanone that he’s waiting for direction from the local lodge about Jan. 6 advocacy — and the leader of that lodge telling Fanone that “I’m hesitant to start putting out information one way or the other about January 6” because of political divisions among membership.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/23/ef/e681f86a4cf0b511f712fa64e4db/2e1ejd1.jpg\"> <br> <p>There are also cameos by Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson, and Rep. Andrew Clyde, the man who referred to Jan. 6 as a “normal tourist visit” and later <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/17/defund-vs-defend-police-494931\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;drew flak&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/17/defund-vs-defend-police-494931&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8120000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-be8b-d3b7-a79f-bedfe8120001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">drew flak</a> for refusing to shake Fanone’s hand.</p> <p>In toto, the interactions add up to a bunch of influential people telling Fanone that, although they may personally support him, they won’t do anything public to speak up against the significant portion of the population who think the insurrection was somehow fake.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/37/e5/d54c1f624e0a8f1cd14a12c3cfe9/gettyimages-1325465978.jpg\"> <br> <p>“I approached those interactions in the same way that I approached doing an undercover drug buy or participating in any other narcotics operation,” Fanone tells me. “I’d casually make the drive to the Hill, relax myself” using breathing exercises designed to lower blood pressure and calm nerves. “And then the minute I parked my car and got out, it was like, you just turn a switch on. And, you know, every conversation that I had was intentional and every interaction I had was intentional.”</p> <p>In some ways, <i>Hold the Line</i> — written with my friend and former colleague John Shiffman, now an investigative reporter for Reuters — might seem like your standard quickie book by a flash-in-the-pan hero. We learn a bit of Fanone’s backstory (teenage knucklehead turned punk rocker turned decorated undercover cop) and are treated to a first-person account of Jan. 6 that’s alternatively infuriating (when Fanone and his partner self-deployed to the Capitol after hearing about the disturbance on the police radio, they were initially stopped by a Capitol cop because their city police vehicle didn’t have the proper parking pass) and harrowing (“I’ve got kids!” Fanone screamed as rioters yelled to kill him with his own gun). He also writes thoughtfully about policing.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/27/2b867bea4bc795ee6b1eceb56abb/unknown-2.jpeg\"> <br> <p>But as vivid as Fanone’s descriptions of the violence are, the most memorable parts of the book concern the months after the insurrection, as Fanone recovered from his injuries — and significant chunks of Washington seemed eager to stop thinking about what had happened.</p> <p>Fanone’s Beltway quasi-fame really took shape about a week after the riot, when a CNN interviewer asked what he’d say to members of the mob who rescued him. “Thank you, but fuck you for being there,” Fanone responded. The clip went viral, turning Fanone into a local celebrity of sorts.</p> <p>In print and in person, Fanone turns out to be the same guy as he was in his profane cable debut. There are 155 F-bombs in the book’s 220 pages. A 69-minute recording of one of our interviews featured another 85 permutations of the word, or more than one per minute. Combined with the tattoos and the dark piercing eyes, Fanone’s refusal to speak in PR lingo helped turn him into a kind of spokesperson for the heroes of Jan. 6, the everyman cop who charged into danger in order to protect the big shots.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/1c/8d/74bc16624e53b75d65ff46f8aace/unknown.jpeg\"> <br> <p>In the book, though, the everyman soon finds himself in an unexpected position: Instead of accepting the thanks of a grateful capital, he winds up becoming an activist of sorts, militating on behalf of the law enforcement who faced the mob — and, eventually, on behalf of actually remembering the event. His monomania also made him a polarizing figure among law enforcement and others. “I just want people to fucking recognize what happened on January 6,” he says.</p> <p>Hence the meetings with Capitol Hill titans, and the appearances on TV, and the testimony at hearings. And the tone of betrayal that permeates the book.</p> <p>The saddest parts of the book are almost certainly the interactions with fellow police. Fanone quickly soured on the FOP, which he felt had been too quiet about the insurrection. They hadn’t said the wrong thing per se, but considering how loud the union was with denunciations of anti-cop politicians, and how quick its spokespeople were to note stories of police attacked on the job, he felt the tone of their Jan. 6 commentary was oddly listless.</p> <p>In a meeting he chronicles at the union’s D.C. hall, Dunn is scolded after asking why the leadership hadn’t defended officers against the claim that the shooting of Ashli Babbitt was murder. A local honcho, meanwhile, gives Fanone grief for appearing on CNN “when they talk bad about law enforcement.” And Yoes, to Fanone’s amazement, tells the room that Trump, at FOP insistence, had in fact told the crowd to stand down that day.</p> <p>“In reality, what it is is Trumpism,” Fanone tells me by way of explanation. “And it's a loyalty to Donald Trump because he says things like, ‘We love our law enforcement officers.’ And, you know, there's a lot of police officers at the Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement agencies that participated in the defense of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, that still do not accept the reality of what January 6th was.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/db/b5/f9ac327747edbe87ac45ad196a68/ap21208525503688.jpg\"> <br> <p>After the meeting, he writes, Gregg Pemberton, who leads the D.C. local, comes over to Fanone and essentially says he has politics to manage. “I’ve got Trump supporters on one side. I’ve got others on the other side. When I start to engage in supporting or not supporting the work that you have done, I get pigeonholed,” Fanone’s book quotes him saying. So much for backing the Blue. Pemberton, he writes, later tells him he doubts there’s anything he could do to change the minds of people who buy the idea that the riot was no big deal.</p> <p>Asked this week about the comments, Pemberton responded with a statement that didn’t address the specifics but rejected the idea that the union hadn’t backed Fanone. “The DC Police Union did everything in its power to support Mike Fanone while he was a member of the Union,” Pemberton wrote. “We understand that this incident has taken a toll on him. Because of that, he chose to separate from the department. We wish him the best in all of his future endeavors.”</p> <p>“In all my conversations with MPD Officer Fanone and the other heroes who were attacked on January 6th we offered our unequivocal support for them,” Yoes said in a statement. “The FOP was very aggressive in calling on Federal, State, and local leaders to take steps to hold the January 6th rioters to account and to suggest that the FOP did not want to get involved is at variance with the facts.” He also forwarded a long list of statements he and the union had made in support of police who battled the rioters.</p> <p>The offices of McCarthy and Graham did not respond to detailed requests for comment.</p> <p>Eventually, Fanone writes, the fractured relations with fellow officers — some based on politics, others on a more prosaic resentment of someone who was suddenly a famous media darling — make work impossible. He begins worrying that he’ll wind up like NYPD whistleblower Frank Serpico, who was shot in the face under mysterious circumstances after exposing corruption, nearly died because of an oddly delayed response, and eventually left the country.</p> <p>“Whenever I left my cubicle, I was ostracized, treated like a leper,” he writes. “If I approached a group of other officers talking, they would walk away. Every visit to hit the bathroom risked a confrontation. It was not lost on me that most of the venom came from white cops. Black cops, for the most part, were supportive. From them, I got hand-shakes and hugs. Most white cops averted eye contact. A few literally turned their backs.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a8/f2/72aea19f4168bd50a37e548839f6/unknown-1.jpeg\"> <br> <p>After 20 years on the force, and five years shy of retirement, he resigned last year. Today, he makes a living from a contract as a CNN law-enforcement analyst, although once you factor in health care, the income isn’t as good as his police salary. He tells me he’s worried all the time about money. It’s one reason he wrote a book.</p> <p>Leave aside the specifics of Jan. 6, in fact, and Fanone’s book is also a story about class in Washington, documenting the chasm between the national-capital VIPs who run the government and the hometown-D.C. folks who serve the drinks and staff the preschools and, yes, patrol the streets. These tribes exist in perpetually close proximity, but it can take a calamity to force them to interact: On Jan. 6, Fanone had plans to work a heroin case in a public housing project; he only became a public figure because a police radio alerted him to the mob at the Capitol.</p> <p>The upstairs-downstairs vibe adds a certain tension to Fanone’s interactions with the high and mighty. He’s a reminder, just for a minute, that the capital’s somebodies owe their safety to a large cast of nobodies. (Fanone actually has a better sense than many of the divide between insiders and outsiders: As a teen, he spent a year at Georgetown Prep, the elite school that produced Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch; he was, um, “not invited back.”)</p> <p>But longtime members of the Washington village could probably also learn something from the ex-cop’s descriptions of the places where the two worlds intersect. People who comfort themselves that the District’s locals would never be so dismissive as the elected big-shots will not enjoy the description of the D.C. councilmember Fanone says told him that she didn’t want to honor the police department’s Jan. 6 work because so many constituents hate cops. And people who rest assured that this blue bubble of a city doesn’t contain the sorts of tribal furies that get lured to town by the likes of Donald Trump will probably not feel better to read his characterization of the city’s police department as racially riven and full of Jan. 6 deniers. <br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fc/54/3c1cbe2a4281823b4acd194077f3/unknown-3.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Fanone and I actually had another reminder of this same phenomenon, of Washington not being such a bubble after all, about an hour after we scooted away from the courthouse. After driving around for a while in his truck, we’d stopped for coffee at a Starbucks on Capitol Hill. It was a sunny, quiet afternoon in one of Washington’s most charming residential neighborhoods. We snagged a seat on the coffee shop’s outdoor patio. Before long, a woman appeared on the deck of the elegant rowhouse apartment building next door.

The courthouse was a hive of supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, one of whom cursed Fanone in the courtroom, another of whom shouted at him about a conspiracy theory as he stepped away from the building. As we made our way down Pennsylvania Avenue, a man followed us, videotaping from his phone the entire time.\n Fanone, a ubiquitous TV presence since suffering a traumatic brain injury and a heart attack as a result of the assault, is accustomed to the snarling randos. They’ve shown up at his house and the homes of his mom, dad and ex-wife; they’ve made the onetime Donald Trump voter and self-described “redneck cop” afraid of what might happen to him in the isolated rural hunting redoubt that used to be his “safe place” away from the life of an urban vice officer. But when his take-no-prisoners memoir about his experience lands next week, the main targets of his scorn won’t be the random extremists ranting on sidewalks and raving on Telegram. Instead, he’s taking swings at the bigwigs who Fanone says have sought to sweep Jan. 6 under the rug.\n \n  \n The average score-settling memoir is apt to devolve into a he-said/she-said news cycle. Some of the conversations depicted in Fanone’s Hold the Line\",\"_id\":\"00000183-b2da-d824-a1d7-b7faf6370000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Hold the Line have a key difference: The author made surreptitious recordings of his interactions with the likes of House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, national Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes, and leaders of Fanone’s own local, among others. Other conversations, with people such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, weren’t recorded but are recounted in cringey detail.\n \n Thus we see McCarthy, finally taking a meeting with Fanone, fellow Jan. 6 hero Harry Dunn, and the mother of late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, lamely try to run out the clock on their conversation. We see Graham snap at Gladys Sicknick that “we’re going to end the meeting right now” if she keeps speaking ill of Trump. And we see Yoes telling Fanone that he’s waiting for direction from the local lodge about Jan. 6 advocacy — and the leader of that lodge telling Fanone that “I’m hesitant to start putting out information one way or the other about January 6” because of political divisions among membership.\n \n  \n There are also cameos by Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson, and Rep. Andrew Clyde, the man who referred to Jan. 6 as a “normal tourist visit” and later drew flak for refusing to shake Fanone’s hand.\n In toto, the interactions add up to a bunch of influential people telling Fanone that, although they may personally support him, they won’t do anything public to speak up against the significant portion of the population who think the insurrection was somehow fake.\n \n  \n “I approached those interactions in the same way that I approached doing an undercover drug buy or participating in any other narcotics operation,” Fanone tells me. “I’d casually make the drive to the Hill, relax myself” using breathing exercises designed to lower blood pressure and calm nerves. “And then the minute I parked my car and got out, it was like, you just turn a switch on. And, you know, every conversation that I had was intentional and every interaction I had was intentional.”\n In some ways, Hold the Line — written with my friend and former colleague John Shiffman, now an investigative reporter for Reuters — might seem like your standard quickie book by a flash-in-the-pan hero. We learn a bit of Fanone’s backstory (teenage knucklehead turned punk rocker turned decorated undercover cop) and are treated to a first-person account of Jan. 6 that’s alternatively infuriating (when Fanone and his partner self-deployed to the Capitol after hearing about the disturbance on the police radio, they were initially stopped by a Capitol cop because their city police vehicle didn’t have the proper parking pass) and harrowing (“I’ve got kids!” Fanone screamed as rioters yelled to kill him with his own gun). He also writes thoughtfully about policing.\n \n  \n But as vivid as Fanone’s descriptions of the violence are, the most memorable parts of the book concern the months after the insurrection, as Fanone recovered from his injuries — and significant chunks of Washington seemed eager to stop thinking about what had happened.\n Fanone’s Beltway quasi-fame really took shape about a week after the riot, when a CNN interviewer asked what he’d say to members of the mob who rescued him. “Thank you, but fuck you for being there,” Fanone responded. The clip went viral, turning Fanone into a local celebrity of sorts.\n In print and in person, Fanone turns out to be the same guy as he was in his profane cable debut. There are 155 F-bombs in the book’s 220 pages. A 69-minute recording of one of our interviews featured another 85 permutations of the word, or more than one per minute. Combined with the tattoos and the dark piercing eyes, Fanone’s refusal to speak in PR lingo helped turn him into a kind of spokesperson for the heroes of Jan. 6, the everyman cop who charged into danger in order to protect the big shots.\n \n  \n In the book, though, the everyman soon finds himself in an unexpected position: Instead of accepting the thanks of a grateful capital, he winds up becoming an activist of sorts, militating on behalf of the law enforcement who faced the mob — and, eventually, on behalf of actually remembering the event. His monomania also made him a polarizing figure among law enforcement and others. “I just want people to fucking recognize what happened on January 6,” he says.\n Hence the meetings with Capitol Hill titans, and the appearances on TV, and the testimony at hearings. And the tone of betrayal that permeates the book.\n The saddest parts of the book are almost certainly the interactions with fellow police. Fanone quickly soured on the FOP, which he felt had been too quiet about the insurrection. They hadn’t said the wrong thing per se, but considering how loud the union was with denunciations of anti-cop politicians, and how quick its spokespeople were to note stories of police attacked on the job, he felt the tone of their Jan. 6 commentary was oddly listless.\n In a meeting he chronicles at the union’s D.C. hall, Dunn is scolded after asking why the leadership hadn’t defended officers against the claim that the shooting of Ashli Babbitt was murder. A local honcho, meanwhile, gives Fanone grief for appearing on CNN “when they talk bad about law enforcement.” And Yoes, to Fanone’s amazement, tells the room that Trump, at FOP insistence, had in fact told the crowd to stand down that day.\n “In reality, what it is is Trumpism,” Fanone tells me by way of explanation. “And it's a loyalty to Donald Trump because he says things like, ‘We love our law enforcement officers.’ And, you know, there's a lot of police officers at the Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement agencies that participated in the defense of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, that still do not accept the reality of what January 6th was.”\n \n  \n After the meeting, he writes, Gregg Pemberton, who leads the D.C. local, comes over to Fanone and essentially says he has politics to manage. “I’ve got Trump supporters on one side. I’ve got others on the other side. When I start to engage in supporting or not supporting the work that you have done, I get pigeonholed,” Fanone’s book quotes him saying. So much for backing the Blue. Pemberton, he writes, later tells him he doubts there’s anything he could do to change the minds of people who buy the idea that the riot was no big deal.\n Asked this week about the comments, Pemberton responded with a statement that didn’t address the specifics but rejected the idea that the union hadn’t backed Fanone. “The DC Police Union did everything in its power to support Mike Fanone while he was a member of the Union,” Pemberton wrote. “We understand that this incident has taken a toll on him. Because of that, he chose to separate from the department. We wish him the best in all of his future endeavors.”\n “In all my conversations with MPD Officer Fanone and the other heroes who were attacked on January 6th we offered our unequivocal support for them,” Yoes said in a statement. “The FOP was very aggressive in calling on Federal, State, and local leaders to take steps to hold the January 6th rioters to account and to suggest that the FOP did not want to get involved is at variance with the facts.” He also forwarded a long list of statements he and the union had made in support of police who battled the rioters.\n The offices of McCarthy and Graham did not respond to detailed requests for comment.\n Eventually, Fanone writes, the fractured relations with fellow officers — some based on politics, others on a more prosaic resentment of someone who was suddenly a famous media darling — make work impossible. He begins worrying that he’ll wind up like NYPD whistleblower Frank Serpico, who was shot in the face under mysterious circumstances after exposing corruption, nearly died because of an oddly delayed response, and eventually left the country.\n “Whenever I left my cubicle, I was ostracized, treated like a leper,” he writes. “If I approached a group of other officers talking, they would walk away. Every visit to hit the bathroom risked a confrontation. It was not lost on me that most of the venom came from white cops. Black cops, for the most part, were supportive. From them, I got hand-shakes and hugs. Most white cops averted eye contact. A few literally turned their backs.”\n \n  \n After 20 years on the force, and five years shy of retirement, he resigned last year. Today, he makes a living from a contract as a CNN law-enforcement analyst, although once you factor in health care, the income isn’t as good as his police salary. He tells me he’s worried all the time about money. It’s one reason he wrote a book.\n Leave aside the specifics of Jan. 6, in fact, and Fanone’s book is also a story about class in Washington, documenting the chasm between the national-capital VIPs who run the government and the hometown-D.C. folks who serve the drinks and staff the preschools and, yes, patrol the streets. These tribes exist in perpetually close proximity, but it can take a calamity to force them to interact: On Jan. 6, Fanone had plans to work a heroin case in a public housing project; he only became a public figure because a police radio alerted him to the mob at the Capitol.\n The upstairs-downstairs vibe adds a certain tension to Fanone’s interactions with the high and mighty. He’s a reminder, just for a minute, that the capital’s somebodies owe their safety to a large cast of nobodies. (Fanone actually has a better sense than many of the divide between insiders and outsiders: As a teen, he spent a year at Georgetown Prep, the elite school that produced Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch; he was, um, “not invited back.”)\n But longtime members of the Washington village could probably also learn something from the ex-cop’s descriptions of the places where the two worlds intersect. People who comfort themselves that the District’s locals would never be so dismissive as the elected big-shots will not enjoy the description of the D.C. councilmember Fanone says told him that she didn’t want to honor the police department’s Jan. 6 work because so many constituents hate cops. And people who rest assured that this blue bubble of a city doesn’t contain the sorts of tribal furies that get lured to town by the likes of Donald Trump will probably not feel better to read his characterization of the city’s police department as racially riven and full of Jan. 6 deniers. \n \n  \n Fanone and I actually had another reminder of this same phenomenon, of Washington not being such a bubble after all, about an hour after we scooted away from the courthouse. After driving around for a while in his truck, we’d stopped for coffee at a Starbucks on Capitol Hill. It was a sunny, quiet afternoon in one of Washington’s most charming residential neighborhoods. We snagged a seat on the coffee shop’s outdoor patio. Before long, a woman appeared on the deck of the elegant rowhouse apartment building next door. She was holding a sign directed at Fanone: “Who Is Ray Epps?” Epps, in the fevered imaginings of conspiracy theorists, was part of a supposed FBI scheme to frame Trump supporters for the insurrection. She yelled at me to grill Fanone about the converup.\n Even amid the placid Victoriana, Fanone’s reality was right there. Two days later, news would break that the FBI was investigating threatening calls and messages to him. He fully expects things to get nuttier still when the book officially launches on Oct. 11. But at least for a second, he appeared to appreciate the absurdity.\n Fanone pulled out his phone and took a selfie with the sign-bearing woman in the background, mugging for the camera.","dc:creator":"Michael Schaffer","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/png","url":"https://static.politico.com/bb/d4/915ecfd34f75834b10c4bb9d821b/new-final-v2.png"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration / Getty Images / iStock","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/bb/d4/915ecfd34f75834b10c4bb9d821b/new-final-v2.png"}}]},"content":"In a new memoir, the hero cop is naming names like Kevin McCarthy, Lindsey Graham and his own union bosses.","contentSnippet":"In a new memoir, the hero cop is naming names like Kevin McCarthy, Lindsey Graham and his own union bosses.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/07/michael-fanone-jan-6-riot-cop-00060556","isoDate":"2022-10-07T08:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"A fallen Michigan football coach, a silent stadium and moments that remind us who we are","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/fallen-michigan-football-coach-silent-101049757.html","pubDate":"2022-10-09T10:10:49Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eFGj4lNyk9HKoSvbX3uAIg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/detroit-free-press/ad2a8dad66e9c783dac4a7ea6decd48f","width":"130"}},"guid":"fallen-michigan-football-coach-silent-101049757.html","isoDate":"2022-10-09T10:10:49.000Z"},{"creator":"Taryn Luna","title":"Candidate's financial history under scrutiny in California controller's race","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-05/controllers-race-malia-cohen","pubDate":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 12:00:04 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Malia Cohen is facing scrutiny over how she has managed her personal finances following the recent suspension of her business license for unpaid taxes and the foreclosure of her San Francisco condo more than a decade ago.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Malia Cohen is facing scrutiny over how she has managed her personal finances following the recent suspension of her business license for unpaid taxes and the foreclosure of her San Francisco condo more than a decade ago.","dc:creator":"Taryn Luna","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/80a3c20/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4319x2901+0+0/resize/1500x1008!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F0c%2F0bbfeadb4d62b075fabbf9fbf542%2Fsan-francisco-soda-tax.JPEG","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Supervisor Malia Cohen speaks during a news conference announcing that San Francisco backers of a tax on sugary beverages have enough signatures to put the measure on the November ballot ouside of City Hall in San Francisco, Thursday, May 12, 2016.

The former GOP operatives gone rogue — who created some of the 2020 cycle’s most vicious, viral ads against Donald Trump — considered themselves an unlikely defense against an existential threat to democracy, a black-ops squad fighting an autocrat with an even blacker soul. “There’s nothing noble about us. But we’re useful,” co-founder Stuart Stevens says at one point in “The Lincoln Project,” the new Showtime documentary series that chronicles the super PAC’s meteoric rise and partial fall. “And if you really believe this is a fight for democracy … you need every useful sonofabitch you can get on your side.”</p> <p>Trump did indeed lose, and while it’s impossible to draw a straight line between viral videos and actual votes, the Lincoln Project was more than willing to take some credit. The series acknowledges what the group did accomplish in 2020: getting under Trump’s skin, raising $90 million in donations, offering regular doses of catharsis to the Trump-hating half of the country. But all of that effort only went so far. Trump still got 74 million votes; he still looms in 2022 and 2024; Trump knockoffs abound in this year’s midterm elections. And one scene in the series, a few episodes earlier, offers a compelling theory of why.</p> <p>It takes place a handful of days before the 2020 election, when a top Lincoln Project staffer named Sarah Lenti gets on a Zoom call with her devoutly religious mother, trying to persuade her to vote against Trump. Sarah brings a pro-life colleague onto the call to help, but her mother isn’t having it. “I’m not crazy about him either, but no one is beyond redemption,” she says. And when Sarah explodes in frustration — “Trump is the antithesis of everything that a Godly man should be!” — her mother stays calm. “You are so angry, and you hate him so much. That is what you’re running on instead of running on issues,” she tells her daughter. “I feel like I have a better chance in the pro-life arena with Donald Trump as president and a conservative White House.”</p> <p>The thing is, she’s right — Trump begat <i>Dobbs</i>, which killed<i> Roe </i>— and her logic underscores the limits of the Lincoln Project’s grand ambitions and sweeping rhetoric. “Today, the dividing line in American politics is not between conservatives and liberals. It’s between those who believe in democracy and those who are killing it,” intones the voice-over on one Lincoln Project ad from 2020, but that’s not entirely true. Yes, some of Trump’s 2020 votes were cast by QAnon conspiracy theorists and Capitol stormers and people so steeped in the Trumpworld media bubble that they didn’t know truth from fiction. But some were cast by issue-driven voters who made what they saw as a practical calculation. It’s the same reason so many members of Congress who are less conspiracy-steeped than Marjorie Taylor Greene have stood by Trump, and the reason all of the fact-checking and social-media ranting and skillfully-crafted propaganda will only go so far. A substantial number of voters see who Trump is. They’ve baked it into their worldview. And they’re going to vote for him anyway.</p> <p>Worrying about the future of democracy is a luxury, after all — something you can dwell on when you’re not driven by religious mission or worried about the source of your next paycheck. That’s a dividing line in American politics, too. And as “The Lincoln Project” shows us, political consultants can forget which side of the divide they’re on. As the series follows the leaders of the Super PAC, on Zoom and at their headquarters in the ski resort town of Park City, Utah, we see glorious vistas, an impressive array of Patagonia jackets, and a series of home interiors worthy of spreads in <i>Dwell</i>.

Stevens recalls, with a twinge of regret, how he played the race card in campaigns, decades before Trump did it so effectively. “You’re able to convince yourself that the danger of the other side is greater than the flaws of the side that you’re for,” Stevens says. “We played too much on the dark side, but I think pretty much everybody does.”</p> <p>“The Lincoln Project” offers a rare window into this world of idealism and self-denial; its staffers aren’t publicity-shy, and co-directors Fisher Stevens and Karim Amer get access to meetings, planning sessions, conspiratorial phone calls and lengthy bouts of philosophizing.

The story morphs at some point into internecine drama — clashing egos, secret deals, ugly accusations, a stunning sexual harassment claim — that’s juicy enough to rival HBO’s fictional series “Succession,” on which Fisher Stevens is also an actor.</p> <p>And the series suggests one reason those battles over money and power seem inevitable: Success in this arena has made some people very, very rich. Some Lincoln Project founders seem at least mildly conflicted that the work that brought them so much material wealth also laid the foundation for Trump’s rise. “Is making money out of an outrage machine helping democracy or is it hurting it?

It creates a blind spot, a disconnect between the heady thinking of the political elite and the way many voters actually behave. Many accounts of Red State America — including Farah Stockman’s recent book <i>American Made</i>, about Indiana workers displaced when their bearing factory moves to Mexico — show how macro-level political and economic decisions, abstractions for people with graduate degrees, can be real-life catastrophes for workers on the frontlines.

At the same time, she’s willing to believe the best in people, even Donald Trump. “Let’s understand that you know, he can change, too,” she tells her daughter.

Previously, even well-funded campaigns wouldn’t skip a debate because it was key to reaching elusive undecided voters in prime time. With the advent of social media and mobile phones, data-savvy campaigns can micro-target key voter cohorts in every neighborhood and demographic group with selective messages. One cohort may get targeted with a candidate’s messages on crime and immigration, but not on abortion. Another may be targeted with images of the candidate holding his golden retriever, but never his shotgun. Data analytics let campaigns script nuanced, specific messages to individual voters. Debates disrupt selective messaging with an adversarial and competitive format that forces candidates to own and defend all their views, including the controversial ones.</p> <p>Finally, a debate can wreck a candidate’s carefully constructed image. The format doesn’t just highlight the range of issues, it also reveals character under pressure. Candidates have to express and defend their beliefs in a live, unscripted environment without the support of a teleprompter or staff. They can easily make mistakes, forget facts, go off-script, or react emotionally. In the last few weeks of a campaign, candidates are often sleep-deprived, frustrated with the press and have contempt for their opponent, or at least their attack ads, on key issues. Tempers run short, and the format is live and face to face. It is, in short, unpredictable — a campaign manager’s worst nightmare.</p> <p>But what makes debates dangerous for campaigns are exactly what make them great for democracy.</p> <p>The competitive and adversarial aspect of debate forces those seeking the exceptional powers to govern our lives to clearly lay out their views. This format privileges people who have really thought about what they believe and can explain to others — including their opponent — why they should believe it too. They may not convince everyone, but at least the public will have some sense of where they stand.</p> <p>Debates are so critical to a healthy democracy that they should be made essentially mandatory for candidates. Here’s how to do it.</p> <p>First, states should pass bipartisan legislation establishing requirements for debates so they aren’t subject to the fickleness of campaign managers. For elections to the most important statewide positions, like senator or governor, candidates should be made to participate in no fewer than two live broadcast debates before voting begins. Each party could nominate a slate of moderators from which the other party can pick in alternative debates, and questions from the public can be drawn by lottery to ensure fairness.</p> <p>In the absence of legislation, campaigns that choose to opt out should still be made to pay dearly. TV stations that sponsor debates can continue to hold them and ensure absentee candidates are highlighted by an empty chair with a “will not debate” sign printed beside their name. Attending candidates can have a rigorous prime-time exchange with a fair moderator instead of losing the opportunity to reach people because of another campaign’s refusal to debate.</p> <p>Finally, debate formats can be flexible. Live TV and streaming are best, but in states where campaigns have already canceled these debates, media platforms should work out alternatives. A TV station could offer short, concurrent, taped online interviews of candidate responses to a series of identical questions, with follow-up responses. A newspaper could offer candidates a series of short-form side-by-side op-eds on key issues that highlight differences and offer follow-up rebuttals or clarifications. It’s not the best way to test the candidates, but it’s better than nothing.</p> <p>Debate is dangerous precisely because it can torpedo well-financed, image-heavy, selective-messaging campaigns. It can have an invaluable leveling effect on a race while also raising the discourse by creating live, face-to-face accountability for ideas and messages that are otherwise reduced to attack ads. This accountability of saying what you believe to someone directly is why the power of debate has allowed some of our greatest and least likely leaders to emerge from underfunded campaigns with unorthodox ideas.

Huddled with his team in the impeachment managers’ holding room after the Senate trial proceedings had finished on Friday evening, the Maryland Democrat was stunned at the revelations: A moderate House Republican whom Raskin had never met was claiming to have firsthand evidence that Trump had sided with the mob on Jan. 6.</p> <p>It was Feb. 12, 2021, and Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington had told CNN that Kevin McCarthy had confided he had spoken with the president during the insurrection. McCarthy, she said, told her Trump had flatly refused McCarthy’s plea for help despite knowing how chaotic and horrific the Capitol attack had been. In her notes, she had scribbled down one particularly damning utterance from the former president. “Well, Kevin,” McCarthy had recounted Trump as saying, “I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”</p> <p>Raskin, the lead manager in Trump’s second impeachment, gaped at the quote. “How can anybody hear this news and not convict him?!” he exclaimed.</p> <p>The story’s revelations only got more staggering. Other Republicans had also confirmed hearing about the McCarthy-Trump exchange. One even told CNN that Trump, despite his claims of innocence, was “not a blameless observer. He was rooting for them.”</p> <p>But Herrera Beutler had stuck out her neck furthest of all by describing Trump’s selfish nonchalance that day. “That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn’t care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry,” she told CNN. “We should never stand for that, for any reason, under any party flag.”</p> <p><i>Who was this woman?</i> Raskin wanted to know. She had been among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. But his familiarity with her began and ended there. Whatever her story, Raskin knew one thing: This other Jaime was about to become his best friend.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/bd/05/89c56e624e14b33c077e7f518892/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.jhb.jpg\"> <br> <p>The story was dynamite, Raskin thought, and could blow up the last of the Trump team’s slipshod defense. Just a few hours earlier, the president’s counsel Michael van der Veen had argued — weakly — that Trump tried to protect his vice president from the hordes of rioters calling for his head. “I’m sure Mr. Trump very much is concerned and was concerned for the safety and well-being of Mr. Pence and everybody else that was over here,” he had said. It was a flimsy conjecture that everyone knew was a lie — and here was the proof.</p> <p>“We should try to reach out to this Jaime Herrera Beutler and get her notes,” Raskin told the managers in their prep room.</p> <p>“I know Jaime really well,” Diana DeGette of Colorado piped up, offering to be the go-between.</p> <p>“Try her and see if other House Republicans know about this call too,” Raskin instructed.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler’s revelations complicated an already frenzied Friday night. The managers had been caught flat-footed. When Trump’s lawyers had rested their case after just a couple of hours, setting up closing arguments for Saturday morning. The managers hadn’t expected to give their closing statements until Sunday or Monday and hadn’t yet written a word of them. Even before the CNN story landed, they were staring down another all-nighter in a week where they had barely slept.</p> <p>Raskin instructed anyone who wasn’t responsible for delivering final arguments to go home and get some rest. But as the managers started collecting their belongings, one of them, Eric Swalwell, posed a question to the room.</p> <p>“Hasn’t this CNN story changed things?” the California Democrat asked, pointing out that in much of that afternoon’s Q&amp;A session, GOP senators had asked what Trump knew and didn’t know about the violence. The report, he argued, was an opportunity to give them answers in real time.</p> <p>“Shouldn’t we be calling for witnesses now?” Swalwell asked.</p> <p>Raskin paused. Swalwell had a point. But it was too massive a change in strategy to make a hasty decision.</p> <p>“We aren’t going to talk about witnesses now,” he said. “I’ll be in touch.”</p> <p>For weeks, Raskin had engaged in a top secret search for a firsthand witness from the president’s inner circle who could add something valuable to the narrative. His team had even privately sparred with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s team about leaving open the possibility of calling for new testimony — a move that ran counter to the New York Democrat’s eagerness for a quick trial so the party could move on to confirming President Joe Biden’s nominees. When none of their leads volunteered to come forward, Raskin had shrugged it off, projecting confidence that witnesses weren’t necessary to win. But Herrera Beutler’s account was making him rethink his decision. <i>How could they refuse to have her explain her bombshell story?</i></p> <p>In the year-and-a-half-long saga of the two impeachments of Donald Trump, few moments better exemplify the susceptibility of impeachment to the political whims of Congress as the last, frantic 24 hours of Trump’s second trial. The absence of key firsthand accounts had created a major roadblock to conviction in Trump’s first impeachment. House Democrats had chosen to avoid pursuing witnesses to get the politically fraught effort over with as soon as possible, but that had cost them support among several moderate House and Senate Republicans who privately had been open to conviction. In the end, that first failed effort boosted the president’s popularity, emboldening rather than constraining him. But more than 250 interviews with key players in both parties would reveal that the same political calculations made on both sides of the aisle that ended up hobbling the first impeachment would also cripple the second. Republicans who had stuck their necks out to impeach Trump after Jan. 6 would hide in fear of political retaliation rather than help the managers in their effort to convict the former president. And Raskin and his team would learn to their dismay that their own party could prove equally obstructionist when it suited their political purposes.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9a/e6/d3e2f4a8434d87cae4ff85ad89b5/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.doors.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9c/ec/1382e1a4405f8257bbf6c2ac5c9f/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-01.png\"> <br> <p><b>About an hour later, </b>DeGette poked her head back in the room with a double whammy of bad news. Herrera Beutler’s cell had gone straight to voicemail. DeGette had sent a text asking to talk, but the Washington Republican still hadn’t responded. And DeGette’s efforts to find other Republicans aware of the McCarthy-Trump conversation had also come up short. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) of Michigan, one of the 10 GOP impeachers, told her that only Herrera Beutler had heard McCarthy’s tale, though the GOP leader had indeed conveyed the account to multiple people. That limited the number of people who could confirm the report to one, she conveyed to the team.</p> <p>At 9:30 p.m., just as Raskin and the rest of the managers were about to head home, signs of life from Herrera Beutler gave them new hope. She texted DeGette that she was on the West Coast with her children but would be in touch soon, inquiring about the managers’ timeline. DeGette told her they would resume the trial at 10 a.m. the next morning and to call her ASAP, indicating that they’d be interested in seeing her notes about McCarthy’s call. <i>Maybe she’ll cooperate after all</i>, Raskin thought as he departed the Capitol.</p> <p>Raskin was up late that night, waiting for smoke signals from Herrera Beutler, when team attorney Barry Berke called with more encouraging news. Swalwell had texted Congressman Greg Pence (R-Ind.) that night to inquire if his brother, the former vice president, would be willing to sit for a deposition. Pence had responded by texting back a shrug emoji — which as Swalwell read it, wasn’t saying no. Swalwell had then reached out to Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), another of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, who had also been in close contact with Pence world throughout the trial and whose wife was a former Pence staffer. Kinzinger told him that the vice president’s team was furious at Trump’s lawyers for suggesting the president had cared about Pence’s safety on Jan. 6 when he hadn’t checked on him once during the riot. He suggested the vice president might actually allow his team to testify to set the record straight and advised Swalwell to contact Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, who had been with him through the riot. Kinzinger gave Swalwell Short’s cell phone number, and Swalwell fired off a text.</p> <p>“We would like to receive your testimony about January 6 in any manner you were comfortable,” Swalwell wrote, after introducing himself to Short. The managers, he continued, would be willing to conduct a deposition behind closed doors, eschew cameras, and even stick to subjects Short was comfortable with. Anything to get his cooperation.</p> <p>“We are also able to provide a subpoena if that makes it easier to do so,” Swalwell offered. “Anything you can add would be helpful . . .We have to know soon as this may wrap tomorrow if we don’t have a witness.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/d0/70/00b6badf4915900a41ceea556bcc/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.pence.jpg\"> <br> <p>Then, Swalwell called Berke to give him an update.</p> <p>As Berke recounted Swalwell’s efforts to Raskin, he added that he had also enlisted the managers’ new ally Charles Cooper to help. Right before the trial, the prominent conservative attorney had done them an unexpected favor, penning an op-ed in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> stating the impeachment trial was entirely constitutional — directly contradicting the talking point most Senate Republicans had been rallying around. Berke thought maybe Cooper would assist them in convincing Short to testify. Cooper said he’d reach out to his Pence contacts and report back.</p> <p>As he hung up the phone, Raskin could hardly believe their developing good fortune: The former vice president’s inner circle might be willing to refute Trump’s case! But what about Herrera</p> <p>Beutler? He looked at the clock. It was after 11 p.m. — 8 p.m. on the West Coast — and his team still hadn’t heard back from her. He picked up the phone to try her himself, but her mailbox was full. Desperate, Raskin left a message on her office’s general line, even though it was well after hours on Friday. He crossed his fingers that some staffer would get the message by morning and call him back. In his frustration, Raskin dialed Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) — the No. 3 House Republican who’d been secretly advising him on impeachment for weeks — to vent.</p> <p>“We’re trying our hardest to get in touch with Jaime Herrera Beutler,” he said.</p> <p>“Yeah, she seems to have gone into hiding,” Cheney replied.</p> <p>“I’m trying to get in touch with her,” Raskin said again.</p> <p>“I think she knows that,” Cheney said drily.</p> <p>A few hours later, when Raskin phoned Herrera Beutler again, she had cleared out her crowded voice mailbox. He tried to make himself sound as friendly and welcoming as possible. “We haven’t met yet, but I am a fellow Jamie and I’m eager to talk to you about impeachment,” he said. “Sorry these are arduous circumstances. Please call me back when you can.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c0/ae/26defaf64992a5193581c5d173e9/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.meeting%20section%20breadk.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/d2/f7cc66fb4b71a19d030bcd884d6d/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-03.png\"> <br> <p><b>The Signal chain on Raskin’s phone </b>started exploding around 7:40 the next morning. His managers were unequivocal: They wanted witnesses. Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) sent a link to a <i>New York Daily News</i> story headlined: “Schumer says Senate will call witnesses for Trump’s trial — if impeachment managers want them.” The Senate majority leader is clearly putting this decision solely on us, he wrote. If we don’t call witnesses, we’re going to get massacred for pulling punches if we fail to convict.</p> <p>Swalwell chimed in to agree. Without tipping his hand about his late-night effort to woo Marc Short, he suggested they subpoena the former vice president, his former chief, and even the Secret Service agents who had been with Trump on Jan. 6. If those witnesses challenged their summons in court, Swalwell wrote, “we can ultimately say that we’ve tried.”</p> <p>The rest of the managers piled on. “Can someone explain to me the rationale for not trying to call witnesses?” manager Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) asked in clear frustration. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) joined in, writing that while it may be “uncomfortable for the Senate” to extend the trial, the managers had a duty to take this case all the way.</p> <p>A senior staffer from the impeachment team pushed back and began highlighting all the complications with such a last-minute call.<br></p> <br> <p>The people Swalwell recommended — including Short and Pence — “are likely to be hostile to us,” the staffer wrote. Plus, if they objected and took the matter to court, the legal battle could drag out for weeks or even months, the aide said, echoing — ironically — the same argument Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had made to justify sidestepping court fights for witnesses during Trump’s first impeachment, and which GOP leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later adopted during the trial.</p> <p>As Raskin’s security detail drove him the seven miles of North Capitol Street from his house to Capitol Hill, he quietly digested the frenzied messages dancing across his phone. Herrera Beutler still hadn’t called him back, and in less than two hours he was expected to launch into his closing arguments. But Raskin knew his team was right. The managers had only put one night of effort into securing testimony that could seal the former president’s fate, hardly enough to warrant giving up. Didn’t they have a duty to present the fullest story possible about what Trump had done — if not to secure a conviction, then at least for the history books?<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2c/92/478eee9a4c2daf04a8eb9e28bc5e/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.raskinshadow.jpg\"> <br> <p>When Raskin walked into the managers’ trial anteroom, Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) was staring out the window, whispering the last lines of his closing speech to himself in careful rehearsal. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) was also practicing for what was supposed to be the final moments of the trial. In the center of the room, Raskin’s staff was fighting over what to do. He joined them, knowing the final call would be his to make.</p> <p>The pro-witness camp, led by Berke, argued witnesses could be a powerful tool in convincing the nation — particularly Republican voters — of Trump’s misdeeds. The right witnesses might even change the minds of some GOP senators, he said, earning them enough votes for a conviction. Berke reminded them that Pence’s team had indicated through intermediaries that they might comply with a Senate subpoena. And they had two well-connected Republicans running interference: Cooper was reaching out to Pence’s team as they spoke, and Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had also promised the night before to make a personal appeal to the former vice president and his team, particularly Short.</p> <p>“Let’s start with Herrera Beutler and then see if others like Marc Short feel compelled to testify as well,” Berke proposed. “We have to try. If we don’t, the American people will never forgive us.”</p> <p>But team attorneys Joshua Matz and Aaron Hiller thought upending the trial with a witness Hail Mary was insane. “Once you open the door to witnesses, you destroy the momentum we’ve built — and we’ve already done a bang-up job,” Hiller argued. Plus, it was common knowledge that Pence wanted to run for president in 2024. What if he uses the opportunity to grandstand and curry favor with the base? What if he surprised them by saying the president did nothing wrong?</p> <p>“You want to call witnesses? Which witnesses? We don’t know!” Matz vented, laying out the possible dangers of going down that path. “Are they coming? We don’t know. What will they say? We also don’t know! How long will it take to get their testimony? Also unclear.”<br></p> <br> <p>By Saturday morning, the idea of extending the trial to demand new testimony had caught on. Progressives, including former federal prosecutor-turned-senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, had taken to Twitter to insist Raskin’s team depose McCarthy and the Secret Service. It was becoming clear that if the managers made a play for witnesses, they would have the votes. Raskin nervously checked the time. In less than an hour, everyone — Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Schumer, Biden and the entire watching nation — was expecting him to walk onto the floor and argue that the managers had proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt and then end the trial. But there was nothing stopping him from calling for witnesses instead. The move, Raskin knew, was high-risk but potentially even higher reward. Republican senators had been signaling their keen interest in learning more of what Trump had said and done during those critical hours when the Capitol was under siege. Here was an opportunity to find out.</p> <p>Raskin knew that Democratic Party leaders wouldn’t be happy. They were eager to put impeachment behind them and move on to passing Biden’s agenda. But Raskin had always eschewed the political calculations that habitually guided those in leadership. For him, this wasn’t about political messaging, or the next election, or even how the trial would impact Biden’s planned policy agenda. This was about convincing most Americans that Trump should never hold office again. The lawyer in Raskin cringed at the idea of jumping into the unknown. If they overplayed their hand and things backfired, he knew he would be blamed for having led the managers’ case astray. But the idealist in him, the one who had pleaded so hard with his party’s superiors to chase every investigative lead to hold Trump accountable, could feel the lure of going all in. He just needed one more gut check.</p> <p>Raskin picked up his phone and dialed Cheney, peppering her with a final volley of queries. Would Herrera Beutler be a reliable witness? Were there others who might follow her lead? What did she think about calling witnesses in general? Cheney agreed with the move. Herrera Beutler, she assured Raskin, was an honorable woman who would tell the truth under oath. She would not grandstand. And better yet, she would make a compelling witness. That was all Raskin needed to hear: If Cheney trusted her, then he would as well.</p> <p>Just before 9:40 a.m., with the start of the trial 20 minutes away and still no word from Herrera Beutler, Raskin called the bustling anteroom to attention. Managers and staff dutifully gathered around a coffee table in the center of the room, filling an embroidered couch and chairs set up in a big circle. Once the room quieted, Raskin turned to his lead attorney, whom he knew was the most pro-witness of the bunch.</p> <p>“Barry, what do you think we should do?” he asked.</p> <p>“We don’t have a choice,” Berke responded. “We have to call witnesses.”</p> <p>“Yes, you’re right,” Raskin declared.<br></p> <br> <p>A ripple of excitement spread through the team as managers seconded the decision with sighs of relief and cheers of Absolutely! and Yes! Immediately everyone jumped up to recalibrate their plans. In one corner, Matz, Berke and Hiller began frantically rewriting Raskin’s opening statement for the day. How would Trump’s attorneys react? And how will we respond to that response? No one knew.</p> <p>“Just write something fast!” one attorney shouted as they began scribbling a makeshift script.</p> <p>The other managers, meanwhile, began to plan their next steps. DeGette volunteered to try again to get ahold of Herrera Beutler, whom she’d been trying to reach all morning. Others began plotting when and how they could depose her if she agreed to testify. Would she come back to town today? If not, was a video interview possible? As a staffer informed Schumer’s team of their last-minute change in plans, Raskin made the most important phone call of all. In a dramatic departure from the first impeachment, Pelosi had let Raskin make the day-to-day decisions for the trial, as she promised she would. But this was a big enough shift that the speaker deserved a heads-up, Raskin reasoned. He gave her a chance to object, but he did not ask her permission.</p> <p>“We’ve got to go for this,” he told her. “We’ve got an opening.”</p> <p>“I trust your judgment,” she told Raskin. “It’s up to you.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6a/04/7bdada894be3ab93e9b316022f3a/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.phone.jpg\"> <br> <p>At 10 a.m., a Senate aide appeared at the door. It was time to start. As Raskin headed to the floor, he made a quick call to his Republican friend Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) for the first of what would become a series of last-minute sales pitches to unearth possible witnesses. As one of the 10 who had voted to impeach, Raskin figured Katko knew about this McCarthy tale that Herrera Beutler and the CNN story had exposed.</p> <p>“Are you willing to testify?” Raskin asked Katko as he walked into the chamber.</p> <p>Katko said no. He had heard personally from McCarthy about his Jan. 6 call with Trump, but the New York Republican didn’t mention that and played dumb.</p> <p>“I don’t have any relevant information,” he said. “You need Jaime. She’s all you need.”</p> <p>Katko would later insist for this book that he offered to testify if subpoenaed and he disputes that he told Raskin that Herrera Beutler “is all you need.” Both statements run contrary to the recollections of five members of the managers’ team who were closely following the mad dash for GOP witnesses that day.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a0/3f/ff6309b747ea928ae0b50b78c12c/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.home.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9c/ec/1382e1a4405f8257bbf6c2ac5c9f/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-01.png\"> <br> <p><b>Jaime Herrera Beutler’s cell phone</b> started ringing just after 7 a.m. Pacific time. On the other line, calling from Washington, D.C., one of her aides was in a panic. Raskin had just marched to the Senate floor and shocked the nation by making a pitch to call witnesses as part of a trial — including her. The motion had actually passed, 55 to 45, with almost no debate.</p> <p>“Oh my gosh, you’re being talked about in the middle of this!” the aide told her.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler was dumbfounded. She knew the managers had been trying to get in touch overnight. But neither Raskin nor DeGette had bothered to tell her that they planned to call her as a witness the next morning. A little heads-up would have been nice. Herrera Beutler was with her family that President’s Day weekend, hoping to get some time off the grid after the chaos following the CNN story the day before. She had not even been watching the trial.</p> <p>She flipped the television on. And sure enough, there, in the well of the Senate, Raskin was standing at the podium and citing the statement Herrera Beutler had instructed her staff to release the previous evening as reason to call witnesses. The Senate had no choice but to hear straight from her about “the president’s willful dereliction of duty,” he said.</p> <p>“Awesome,” she said sarcastically.</p> <p>Just a year before, Herrera Beutler had voted against Trump’s first impeachment, citing Democrats’ process fouls she felt could not be overlooked. She had even voted to reelect Trump in 2020 after refusing to back him in 2016. But Herrera Beutler had been deeply disturbed by what happened on Jan. 6. After evacuating in an astronaut-like escape hood from the balcony of the House chamber, where lawmakers had been trapped longest, she barricaded herself in the office of a fellow female Republican. When Trump went on television to praise his followers as “very special” people, she had lost her usual cool. She was so upset, in fact, that she had decided to record a video in her office around nine o’clock that night. In it she implored the nation to come together and reject fear, albeit without naming Trump specifically. Americans, she argued, had died for this democracy, and those rioters were making a sham of those sacrifices. “I had never thought I’d see this day. I felt like we were under siege!” she said. “Every American should be heartbroken. That’s how I felt.”</p> <p>While Herrera Beutler believed Trump had engaged in an impeachable dereliction of duty, she instructed her team to learn exactly what happened at the White House on Jan. 6 before deciding to condemn him. And she pumped her own contacts for info, particularly one well-connected friend: Kevin McCarthy. </p> <p>The details McCarthy disclosed about his call with Trump on the afternoon of the 6th<sup> </sup>had been the deciding factor in Herrera Beutler’s vote. It was clear to her Trump was not only responsible for the violence but had reveled in it. If that didn’t rise to the level of impeachment, she believed, nothing did.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/96/68/270f59824bc1819b89ad7da7f349/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.trumpgrid.jpg\"> <br> <p>Herrera Beutler had known that her vote would jeopardize her standing with Trump supporters in her GOP district. It was why she made a point of being upfront with constituents and explaining her thinking in interviews with local reporters and in town halls, including the details of her talk with McCarthy. So it came as a bit of a surprise when Liz Cheney called her a few days into the impeachment trial with an unusual request: A CNN reporter had heard about McCarthy’s call with Trump and was trying to confirm it, Cheney told her.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler rarely engaged with the national press, but she agreed to be interviewed. The details of McCarthy’s call might prove critical to establishing Trump’s thoughts and motivations. When the story had posted, Herrera Beutler braced for an angry call from McCarthy — but by late Friday night, she still hadn’t heard from him. Instead, it was the Democrats who were leaving frantic messages.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler had a pretty good idea of what they wanted. What good investigator wouldn’t want more information on the McCarthy-Trump phone call? But she felt it was not her story to tell; it was McCarthy’s. What’s more, she knew that there were others who could tell a similar tale. Halfway through the trial, before the CNN story shot Herrera Beutler into the spotlight, she had texted the other GOP impeachers to ask if McCarthy had ever shared the story of his Trump call with any of them. Multiple members on the chain — a support group of sorts they had dubbed “the band of brothers” — responded that he had.<br></p> <br> <p>After the story broke, Herrera Beutler had instructed her team to issue a press release detailing the McCarthy-Trump call. They closed it with a line encouraging anyone who knew anything to step forward, hoping McCarthy would get the message. “To the patriots who were standing next to the former president as these conversations were happening, or even to the former vice president: If you have something to add here, now would be the time,” it read.</p> <p>She then turned her attention back to her family. But on Saturday morning, thanks to Raskin’s surprise move on the Senate floor, her hopes of having a calm weekend flew out the window.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler considered her options. She could decline to testify and take the easy way out —or she could do the brave thing and agree to tell her story. It was a choice that would come with consequences either way, she thought. But she had come this far already. After bucking her own party with a vote to impeach, what more was a deposition in the Senate?</p> <p>Find me a lawyer, she told her team. She needed professional advice before she took the plunge.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/0e/6a/07893a58441d809c9f43cb5a9a19/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.walking.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/d2/f7cc66fb4b71a19d030bcd884d6d/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-03.png\"> <br> <p><b>As soon as the motion to call</b> witnesses passed, Schumer called for an emergency recess and Raskin and his team retreated to their holding room. They were awash with adrenaline, but also struck with terror. They had succeeded in upending the trial completely — and they had no idea what to do next.</p> <p>Huddled in a corner with Berke and Matz, Raskin began furiously calling sympathetic Republicans to see if any would come forward. He dialed Herrera Beutler again. Still no answer. He left a message. Then he tried Katko again. That too went to voicemail. Steve Womack of Arkansas, a sympathetic GOP lawmaker repulsed by Trump, did pick up the phone. Did he know about the Herrera Beutler story? Did he know anything else that could help them? Raskin asked. Or did he know anyone who did know something — anything? Womack said he did not. Ditto with Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), another House Republican who had voted to impeach and sounded physically pained when Raskin introduced himself and asked for assistance.</p> <p>“You should talk to Pence’s people,” Meijer told Raskin, sighing loudly.</p> <p>Upton, the friendly Michigander who had indicated that other moderates would not be able to corroborate Herrera Beutler’s story, wasn’t much help either. When asked if he would be willing to be deposed, Upton declined apologetically and simply wished them luck. He, like Katko, still said nothing about how other moderates had heard the same story from McCarthy as Herrera Beutler.</p> <p>Outside, Washington was in an ecstatic fervor over Raskin’s surprise move. The city had expected Trump’s second impeachment trial to end that afternoon — but now, it seemed, there was a chance the Senate would be in it for the long haul, and possibly hearing firsthand evidence about Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. Progressive Democrats cheered the managers on, encouraging them not to leave a single stone unturned. Trump supporters panicked, decrying Raskin’s move as a sneak attack and threatening revenge.</p> <p>Inside the managers’ room, as Swalwell tried to call Greg Pence, Berke phoned Cooper to see if he’d had any luck finagling permission for Marc Short to testify. Raskin, standing next to him, watched on tenterhooks — and saw his counsel’s face sink. Berke then passed the phone over so Raskin could hear the bad news for himself. Cooper had spoken to Pence’s attorney Richard Cullen: They were not going to cooperate voluntarily. In fact, Pence’s team planned to fight the subpoenas if they were summoned, Cooper said, and had refused to give a preview of what Short might say if called. That meant the managers would have little indication of whether his story was even worth pursuing.</p> <p>“Don’t fuck this up by calling witnesses you might not get,” Cooper told Raskin candidly. “You have a good case right now…If I were you, I don’t think I’d want to risk the record you have... How does it get better? It sure as hell can get worse.”</p> <p>Cooper’s words gave Raskin pause. The influential conservative lawyer was a partisan, but in that moment he was also their ally — and to date, he had been straight with them. If he thought they should drop this effort, maybe they should listen.</p> <p>“Well, that came up . . . Short,” Raskin joked awkwardly, making the obvious pun with the elusive witness’s surname.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Swalwell came back relaying his own deadend: Greg Pence hadn’t even answered his phone.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/38/41/d0ff5cf04e0f86a962ef66a984a2/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.coons.jpg\"> <br> <p>In the midst of the commotion, Senator Chris Coons walked through the door. The stocky lawyer from Delaware with a purposeful demeanor was a committed Democratic moderate known around the building as Biden’s closest ally in the Senate. Though he had just voted for witnesses, Coons couldn’t understand the logic of the managers’ gambit. And he was worried about the trial dragging out and hurting the new president. In fact, Trump’s defense lawyers, furious and blindsided by Raskin’s witness move, had vowed just before the vote that if Raskin called even one witness, they would seek to depose at least one hundred of their own, including Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris. That meant possibly hours of floor debate about which witnesses were relevant — and possibly days or weeks of testimony that could overshadow Biden’s presidency until late February or March. It was a threat that met its mark, as senators on the floor, including other Democrats who had just backed Raskin’s witness strategy, fretted about having to endure elongated proceedings. What’s more, Several Republicans had indicated to Coons that they were ready to convict the president — but if the trial spun out of control, there was no telling what might happen.</p> <p>With those frustrations in mind, Coons had marched into Schumer’s office and demanded to know what the hell was going on. Schumer had permitted the vote, but he also was befuddled by Raskin’s move. He told Coons he didn’t know what Raskin’s game plan was.<s> </s>The Democratic leader was skeptical the ploy would work anyway. If running for their lives on Jan. 6 wasn’t enough to persuade Republicans to convict Trump, then it was hard to believe any other witness would, Schumer reasoned. Coons, who held a similar mindset, offered to go talk to Raskin’s team himself to shut the entire thing down. When Schumer gave him the nod, the senator headed to find the managers.</p> <p>“I know when a jury is ready to vote, and this jury is ready to vote,” Coons declared when he entered the managers’ room.</p> <p>As the team gathered around him, Coons argued that Republicans had already made up their minds and that calling witnesses was a waste of time. Democrats, he argued, had bigger fish to fry: Biden still needed the Senate to confirm most of his Cabinet, and he had a legislative agenda to get onto the floor.</p> <p>“Dragging this out will not be good for the American project or for the American people. We’re trying to do a lot,” he said, choosing terms that sounded to the managers like they came straight from the White House. Coons floated a possible compromise: Have Herrera Beutler make a written affidavit detailing her story, Coons instructed. Then, let the defense get a statement from McCarthy and be done with it.</p> <p>“I’m not taking that deal,” Raskin said flatly, stunned that Coons, as a fellow lawyer, would expect any prosecutor to entertain such unsavory terms. “No way are we allowing McCarthy to deny Herrera Beutler’s story without cross-examining him.”</p> <p>But Coons was adamant. “You’re going to lose Republican votes,” he warned them. “Everyone here wants to go home. They have flights for Valentine’s Day. Some of them are already missing their flights.”</p> <p>Berke jumped in, telling Coons the managers hoped to depose Herrera Beutler and McCarthy by video conference that very day. “Listen, Senator, we hear you on the delay,” he said. “But I have to tell you this is going to go quickly ... And we can do closing arguments tomorrow.”</p> <p>Coons was incredulous at Berke’s naïveté. “That’s nuts!” he shot back. McCarthy would never agree to testify before retaining counsel, he retorted. If they were lucky — and that was a big if — it would take days to depose the GOP leader, not hours.</p> <p>“I encourage you all to just do affidavits,” Coons said sternly. “Do it today and reach a swift resolution.”</p> <p>As he turned to leave, Coons added one more thing. “And just to be clear,” he said over his shoulder, “I’m here speaking only for myself.”</p> <p>When the door closed behind him, the room broke into collective outrage.<br></p> <br> <p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Cicilline said, turning to Neguse. “We are impeaching a president of the United States for inciting a violent insurrection against the government, and these motherfuckers want to go home for Valentine’s Day? Really?”</p> <p>He wasn’t the only one who felt that way. The managers viewed their jobs as one of the most serious things they would ever do in their lives. And yet their own party was pressuring them so they could go enjoy the long weekend. How shortsighted. How repugnant. And how disrespectful.</p> <p>But for Raskin, Coons’ warnings began to revive the doubts that had plagued him earlier that morning. They had succeeded in getting the Senate to agree to witnesses in concept — but the truth was, they still didn’t have any witnesses in hand. Moreover, everyone in the room agreed that Coons wasn’t actually speaking for himself. He might deny it, but his words were as good as a warning from Biden. Despite the uneasiness caused by Coons’ words, the managers continued to forge ahead.</p> <p>Berke, Plaskett and Swalwell began working on questions for a potential cross-examination of McCarthy about his Trump call. Others, including Raskin, debated whether McCarthy would be willing to commit perjury under oath to protect Trump — or if he’d deny the Herrera Beutler story altogether, pitching the trial into an unresolvable he-said-she-said spat that would give Republicans another excuse to acquit.</p> <p>Raskin called Cheney again to get her take. “If we call McCarthy, will he be honest?” Raskin asked.</p> <p>On the other end of the line, Cheney thought about all the times McCarthy had flip-flopped, vowing to do one thing — then doing the exact opposite.</p> <p>“I don’t know,” she admitted.</p> <p>It was a deflating turn of events for the managers, who still weren’t ready to throw in the towel. They started brainstorming backup plans. “Maybe we give up on McCarthy and Short, and just subpoena Herrera Beutler,” one of them suggested. “Or we could subpoena just her notes to buy some time,” another offered.</p> <p>“We should delay the final vote at all costs so we can get the votes to convict,” Lieu declared. “And buy time to see if we can get in touch with anyone willing to tell their story.”</p> <p>Berke, seizing on the managers’ energy, offered an even more aggressive suggestion: So what if no one was offering to testify? Let’s call their bluff and ask the Senate to subpoena these witnesses anyway, he proposed. If acquittal was the alternative, what did they have to lose?<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e3/11/ac3afac14a56bc567ca58821dec3/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.witness.jpg\"> <br> <p>But Raskin wasn’t so sure he agreed. During Trump’s first impeachment trial, impeachment attorneys had argued that the courts would settle any disputes over Trump’s claims to privilege or immunity within a matter of weeks due to the serious nature of a Senate trial. The fact that Trump was no longer in the Oval Office — and could no longer make such claims — should have made their subpoenas even less vulnerable to lengthy court challenges. Yet in the heat of the moment, those same impeachment lawyers on Raskin’s team started losing their earlier confidence about the speed of judicial review. They began to ask themselves: What if these impeachment subpoenas turned out to be no different from their fight over former White House counsel Don McGahn, which was still crawling through the courts almost two years later?</p> <p>Further complicating that calculus was the Trump team’s vow to call a hundred witnesses. Technically, the threat was hollow. The Senate — not Trump’s lawyers and not the managers — had the ultimate authority to approve which subpoenas to issue by a simple majority vote. That meant Trump’s team could try to summon Pelosi or Harris or whomever they wanted, but as long as Senate Democrats stuck together, their efforts would fail. Nonetheless, the House managers began to worry. The time it would take to hold such partisan witness votes might undercut the impact of their presentations, some argued.</p> <p>“This isn’t working,” Matz pushed back on Berke. “We do have something to lose: time, momentum, credibility and persuasion.”</p> <p>As they deliberated, Schumer’s counsel, Mark Patterson, arrived with another possible deal to end the trial without witnesses. He’d been trying to negotiate a way out with the Trump team through McConnell’s counsel Andrew Ferguson, who also wanted to bring the trial to a swift end. They had all come to an agreement that “we are prepared to accept,” Patterson told Berke: the Trump team would allow Herrera Beutler’s statement to be entered into the record without any sort of retort from McCarthy — so long as the managers promised not to call a single witness.</p> <p>Patterson indicated that he thought the managers should take the deal.<br></p> <br> <p>Raskin was still wrestling with the decision when Coons appeared a second time at the doorway to hammer home his end-the-trial message. Republican senators were organizing to hamstring the managers’ witness plans, he declared. Two dozen of them had already decided they were in lockstep with Trump’s lawyer’s threat: If the managers called even one witness, they would force votes to call Pelosi, Harris and dozens more.</p> <p>“Everybody wants to go home,” the Delaware senator said impatiently. “Everybody is pissed, and this trial will unzip if even a single vote on a witness occurs.”</p> <p>The managers recoiled at Coons’ accusing tone.</p> <p>“We also answer to the American people, Senator!” Stacey Plaskett exploded.</p> <p>Coons took a deep breath. “Look, you have somewhere between 54 to 56 votes to convict, but you are losing a vote per hour,” Coons said, his annoyance escalating. “You have to make a decision. You’ve got to do it within the hour. Nobody’s mind is really open at this point.”</p> <p>With that, Coons disappeared again, and a pall fell over the room. The president’s unofficial interlocutor might as well have just clipped their wings — and the managers were plummeting back to reality. The Delaware senator’s warning that they might be losing the room to jury fatigue — just like Schiff’s team had during Trump’s first impeachment — petrified them. They’d been adamant that they would do their utmost to secure as many Republican votes as they could; now the suggestion that they could be undermining their own efforts by simply trying to unearth the truth was shocking — and crushing.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6f/63/2a2043c14e47b1caaa082060c14c/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.ender.jpg\"> <br> <p>The managers couldn’t believe they had found themselves in such a position. They had been chosen by the Speaker of the House to bring charges against a president who had incited an attack against a co-equal branch of government that had resulted in death and destruction and could have cost lawmakers’ lives. Calling witnesses to prosecute that outrage should have transcended any partisan roadblocks or practical inconveniences. It hadn’t. Even Senate Democrats — the people who were supposed to be their allies — were putting intense pressure on them to wrap up so they could move on to other things. Could they not appreciate that this was Congress’s last chance to oust Trump from American politics for good?</p> <p>Raskin knew his decision went beyond the tribulations of one political party. Trump was already on the rebound, with polls showing Republican voters once again rallying around him and GOP lawmakers growing more comfortable with re-embracing him. If there were ever a moment to stop that trend, or reverse it, the moment was now. Raskin had one shot at a captive audience in the Senate, as well as the millions of potential voters watching across the nation.</p> <p>Raskin might have been willing to risk all the political complexities of plowing forward —including the wrath of his own party — but for one glaring problem: In the two hours since the Senate vote, not a single witness had stepped forward. He had no idea that Herrera Beutler’s staffers, at that exact moment, were frantically reaching out to lawyers, hoping to consult one before she agreed to testify. She had even sought assistance from Pelosi’s House counsel Doug Letter, though Letter said he could not help her because he was working with the managers. He never conveyed her interest to Raskin.</p> <p>As the managers looked to him to make a decision, Raskin felt his hands were tied. He had always known it would be a longshot to get a Republican to testify against Trump. Still, he had hoped the gravity of the moment would compel at least one of them to step into the spotlight and put the good of the republic before the pull of their party. It came as a gut punch to realize that when he needed it most, there was no help to be found. Even after a president had tried to lay waste to the fundamental tenets of representative democracy, politics — not principle — was still king of the Hill.</p> <p>Not 10 minutes after Coons left, Raskin caved.</p> <p>“Let’s take the deal,” he said.</p> <p><i>Adapted from </i><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/unchecked-rachael-badekaroun-demirjian?variant=39999908544546\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665094986984,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-6417-d592-a1cb-7ddff4f70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665094986984,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-6417-d592-a1cb-7ddff4f70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/unchecked-rachael-badekaroun-demirjian?variant=39999908544546&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-af65-d513-a19b-bff522cd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;UNCHECKED: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-af65-d513-a19b-bff522cd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">UNCHECKED: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump</a><i> by Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian, to be published Oct. 18 by William Morrow.

Reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins&nbsp;Publishers.</i><br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Jamie Raskin’s eyes bulged as he skimmed the CNN story on his phone. Huddled with his team in the impeachment managers’ holding room after the Senate trial proceedings had finished on Friday evening, the Maryland Democrat was stunned at the revelations: A moderate House Republican whom Raskin had never met was claiming to have firsthand evidence that Trump had sided with the mob on Jan. 6.\n It was Feb. 12, 2021, and Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington had told CNN that Kevin McCarthy had confided he had spoken with the president during the insurrection. McCarthy, she said, told her Trump had flatly refused McCarthy’s plea for help despite knowing how chaotic and horrific the Capitol attack had been. In her notes, she had scribbled down one particularly damning utterance from the former president. “Well, Kevin,” McCarthy had recounted Trump as saying, “I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n Raskin, the lead manager in Trump’s second impeachment, gaped at the quote. “How can anybody hear this news and not convict him?!” he exclaimed.\n The story’s revelations only got more staggering. Other Republicans had also confirmed hearing about the McCarthy-Trump exchange. One even told CNN that Trump, despite his claims of innocence, was “not a blameless observer. He was rooting for them.”\n But Herrera Beutler had stuck out her neck furthest of all by describing Trump’s selfish nonchalance that day. “That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn’t care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry,” she told CNN. “We should never stand for that, for any reason, under any party flag.”\n Who was this woman? Raskin wanted to know. She had been among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. But his familiarity with her began and ended there. Whatever her story, Raskin knew one thing: This other Jaime was about to become his best friend.\n \n  \n The story was dynamite, Raskin thought, and could blow up the last of the Trump team’s slipshod defense. Just a few hours earlier, the president’s counsel Michael van der Veen had argued — weakly — that Trump tried to protect his vice president from the hordes of rioters calling for his head. “I’m sure Mr. Trump very much is concerned and was concerned for the safety and well-being of Mr. Pence and everybody else that was over here,” he had said. It was a flimsy conjecture that everyone knew was a lie — and here was the proof.\n “We should try to reach out to this Jaime Herrera Beutler and get her notes,” Raskin told the managers in their prep room.\n “I know Jaime really well,” Diana DeGette of Colorado piped up, offering to be the go-between.\n “Try her and see if other House Republicans know about this call too,” Raskin instructed.\n Herrera Beutler’s revelations complicated an already frenzied Friday night. The managers had been caught flat-footed. When Trump’s lawyers had rested their case after just a couple of hours, setting up closing arguments for Saturday morning. The managers hadn’t expected to give their closing statements until Sunday or Monday and hadn’t yet written a word of them. Even before the CNN story landed, they were staring down another all-nighter in a week where they had barely slept.\n Raskin instructed anyone who wasn’t responsible for delivering final arguments to go home and get some rest. But as the managers started collecting their belongings, one of them, Eric Swalwell, posed a question to the room.\n “Hasn’t this CNN story changed things?” the California Democrat asked, pointing out that in much of that afternoon’s Q&A session, GOP senators had asked what Trump knew and didn’t know about the violence. The report, he argued, was an opportunity to give them answers in real time.\n “Shouldn’t we be calling for witnesses now?” Swalwell asked.\n Raskin paused. Swalwell had a point. But it was too massive a change in strategy to make a hasty decision.\n “We aren’t going to talk about witnesses now,” he said. “I’ll be in touch.”\n For weeks, Raskin had engaged in a top secret search for a firsthand witness from the president’s inner circle who could add something valuable to the narrative. His team had even privately sparred with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s team about leaving open the possibility of calling for new testimony — a move that ran counter to the New York Democrat’s eagerness for a quick trial so the party could move on to confirming President Joe Biden’s nominees. When none of their leads volunteered to come forward, Raskin had shrugged it off, projecting confidence that witnesses weren’t necessary to win. But Herrera Beutler’s account was making him rethink his decision. How could they refuse to have her explain her bombshell story?\n In the year-and-a-half-long saga of the two impeachments of Donald Trump, few moments better exemplify the susceptibility of impeachment to the political whims of Congress as the last, frantic 24 hours of Trump’s second trial. The absence of key firsthand accounts had created a major roadblock to conviction in Trump’s first impeachment. House Democrats had chosen to avoid pursuing witnesses to get the politically fraught effort over with as soon as possible, but that had cost them support among several moderate House and Senate Republicans who privately had been open to conviction. In the end, that first failed effort boosted the president’s popularity, emboldening rather than constraining him. But more than 250 interviews with key players in both parties would reveal that the same political calculations made on both sides of the aisle that ended up hobbling the first impeachment would also cripple the second. Republicans who had stuck their necks out to impeach Trump after Jan. 6 would hide in fear of political retaliation rather than help the managers in their effort to convict the former president. And Raskin and his team would learn to their dismay that their own party could prove equally obstructionist when it suited their political purposes.\n \n  \n   \n About an hour later, DeGette poked her head back in the room with a double whammy of bad news. Herrera Beutler’s cell had gone straight to voicemail. DeGette had sent a text asking to talk, but the Washington Republican still hadn’t responded. And DeGette’s efforts to find other Republicans aware of the McCarthy-Trump conversation had also come up short. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) of Michigan, one of the 10 GOP impeachers, told her that only Herrera Beutler had heard McCarthy’s tale, though the GOP leader had indeed conveyed the account to multiple people. That limited the number of people who could confirm the report to one, she conveyed to the team.\n At 9:30 p.m., just as Raskin and the rest of the managers were about to head home, signs of life from Herrera Beutler gave them new hope. She texted DeGette that she was on the West Coast with her children but would be in touch soon, inquiring about the managers’ timeline. DeGette told her they would resume the trial at 10 a.m. the next morning and to call her ASAP, indicating that they’d be interested in seeing her notes about McCarthy’s call. Maybe she’ll cooperate after all, Raskin thought as he departed the Capitol.\n Raskin was up late that night, waiting for smoke signals from Herrera Beutler, when team attorney Barry Berke called with more encouraging news. Swalwell had texted Congressman Greg Pence (R-Ind.) that night to inquire if his brother, the former vice president, would be willing to sit for a deposition. Pence had responded by texting back a shrug emoji — which as Swalwell read it, wasn’t saying no. Swalwell had then reached out to Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), another of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, who had also been in close contact with Pence world throughout the trial and whose wife was a former Pence staffer. Kinzinger told him that the vice president’s team was furious at Trump’s lawyers for suggesting the president had cared about Pence’s safety on Jan. 6 when he hadn’t checked on him once during the riot. He suggested the vice president might actually allow his team to testify to set the record straight and advised Swalwell to contact Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, who had been with him through the riot. Kinzinger gave Swalwell Short’s cell phone number, and Swalwell fired off a text.\n “We would like to receive your testimony about January 6 in any manner you were comfortable,” Swalwell wrote, after introducing himself to Short. The managers, he continued, would be willing to conduct a deposition behind closed doors, eschew cameras, and even stick to subjects Short was comfortable with. Anything to get his cooperation.\n “We are also able to provide a subpoena if that makes it easier to do so,” Swalwell offered. “Anything you can add would be helpful . . .We have to know soon as this may wrap tomorrow if we don’t have a witness.”\n \n  \n Then, Swalwell called Berke to give him an update.\n As Berke recounted Swalwell’s efforts to Raskin, he added that he had also enlisted the managers’ new ally Charles Cooper to help. Right before the trial, the prominent conservative attorney had done them an unexpected favor, penning an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal stating the impeachment trial was entirely constitutional — directly contradicting the talking point most Senate Republicans had been rallying around. Berke thought maybe Cooper would assist them in convincing Short to testify. Cooper said he’d reach out to his Pence contacts and report back.\n As he hung up the phone, Raskin could hardly believe their developing good fortune: The former vice president’s inner circle might be willing to refute Trump’s case! But what about Herrera\n Beutler? He looked at the clock. It was after 11 p.m. — 8 p.m. on the West Coast — and his team still hadn’t heard back from her. He picked up the phone to try her himself, but her mailbox was full. Desperate, Raskin left a message on her office’s general line, even though it was well after hours on Friday. He crossed his fingers that some staffer would get the message by morning and call him back. In his frustration, Raskin dialed Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) — the No. 3 House Republican who’d been secretly advising him on impeachment for weeks — to vent.\n “We’re trying our hardest to get in touch with Jaime Herrera Beutler,” he said.\n “Yeah, she seems to have gone into hiding,” Cheney replied.\n “I’m trying to get in touch with her,” Raskin said again.\n “I think she knows that,” Cheney said drily.\n A few hours later, when Raskin phoned Herrera Beutler again, she had cleared out her crowded voice mailbox. He tried to make himself sound as friendly and welcoming as possible. “We haven’t met yet, but I am a fellow Jamie and I’m eager to talk to you about impeachment,” he said. “Sorry these are arduous circumstances. Please call me back when you can.”\n \n  \n   \n The Signal chain on Raskin’s phone started exploding around 7:40 the next morning. His managers were unequivocal: They wanted witnesses. Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) sent a link to a New York Daily News story headlined: “Schumer says Senate will call witnesses for Trump’s trial — if impeachment managers want them.” The Senate majority leader is clearly putting this decision solely on us, he wrote. If we don’t call witnesses, we’re going to get massacred for pulling punches if we fail to convict.\n Swalwell chimed in to agree. Without tipping his hand about his late-night effort to woo Marc Short, he suggested they subpoena the former vice president, his former chief, and even the Secret Service agents who had been with Trump on Jan. 6. If those witnesses challenged their summons in court, Swalwell wrote, “we can ultimately say that we’ve tried.”\n The rest of the managers piled on. “Can someone explain to me the rationale for not trying to call witnesses?” manager Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) asked in clear frustration. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) joined in, writing that while it may be “uncomfortable for the Senate” to extend the trial, the managers had a duty to take this case all the way.\n A senior staffer from the impeachment team pushed back and began highlighting all the complications with such a last-minute call.\n \n The people Swalwell recommended — including Short and Pence — “are likely to be hostile to us,” the staffer wrote. Plus, if they objected and took the matter to court, the legal battle could drag out for weeks or even months, the aide said, echoing — ironically — the same argument Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had made to justify sidestepping court fights for witnesses during Trump’s first impeachment, and which GOP leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later adopted during the trial.\n As Raskin’s security detail drove him the seven miles of North Capitol Street from his house to Capitol Hill, he quietly digested the frenzied messages dancing across his phone. Herrera Beutler still hadn’t called him back, and in less than two hours he was expected to launch into his closing arguments. But Raskin knew his team was right. The managers had only put one night of effort into securing testimony that could seal the former president’s fate, hardly enough to warrant giving up. Didn’t they have a duty to present the fullest story possible about what Trump had done — if not to secure a conviction, then at least for the history books?\n \n  \n When Raskin walked into the managers’ trial anteroom, Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) was staring out the window, whispering the last lines of his closing speech to himself in careful rehearsal. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) was also practicing for what was supposed to be the final moments of the trial. In the center of the room, Raskin’s staff was fighting over what to do. He joined them, knowing the final call would be his to make.\n The pro-witness camp, led by Berke, argued witnesses could be a powerful tool in convincing the nation — particularly Republican voters — of Trump’s misdeeds. The right witnesses might even change the minds of some GOP senators, he said, earning them enough votes for a conviction. Berke reminded them that Pence’s team had indicated through intermediaries that they might comply with a Senate subpoena. And they had two well-connected Republicans running interference: Cooper was reaching out to Pence’s team as they spoke, and Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had also promised the night before to make a personal appeal to the former vice president and his team, particularly Short.\n “Let’s start with Herrera Beutler and then see if others like Marc Short feel compelled to testify as well,” Berke proposed. “We have to try. If we don’t, the American people will never forgive us.”\n But team attorneys Joshua Matz and Aaron Hiller thought upending the trial with a witness Hail Mary was insane. “Once you open the door to witnesses, you destroy the momentum we’ve built — and we’ve already done a bang-up job,” Hiller argued. Plus, it was common knowledge that Pence wanted to run for president in 2024. What if he uses the opportunity to grandstand and curry favor with the base? What if he surprised them by saying the president did nothing wrong?\n “You want to call witnesses? Which witnesses? We don’t know!” Matz vented, laying out the possible dangers of going down that path. “Are they coming? We don’t know. What will they say? We also don’t know! How long will it take to get their testimony? Also unclear.”\n \n By Saturday morning, the idea of extending the trial to demand new testimony had caught on. Progressives, including former federal prosecutor-turned-senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, had taken to Twitter to insist Raskin’s team depose McCarthy and the Secret Service. It was becoming clear that if the managers made a play for witnesses, they would have the votes. Raskin nervously checked the time. In less than an hour, everyone — Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Schumer, Biden and the entire watching nation — was expecting him to walk onto the floor and argue that the managers had proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt and then end the trial. But there was nothing stopping him from calling for witnesses instead. The move, Raskin knew, was high-risk but potentially even higher reward. Republican senators had been signaling their keen interest in learning more of what Trump had said and done during those critical hours when the Capitol was under siege. Here was an opportunity to find out.\n Raskin knew that Democratic Party leaders wouldn’t be happy. They were eager to put impeachment behind them and move on to passing Biden’s agenda. But Raskin had always eschewed the political calculations that habitually guided those in leadership. For him, this wasn’t about political messaging, or the next election, or even how the trial would impact Biden’s planned policy agenda. This was about convincing most Americans that Trump should never hold office again. The lawyer in Raskin cringed at the idea of jumping into the unknown. If they overplayed their hand and things backfired, he knew he would be blamed for having led the managers’ case astray. But the idealist in him, the one who had pleaded so hard with his party’s superiors to chase every investigative lead to hold Trump accountable, could feel the lure of going all in. He just needed one more gut check.\n Raskin picked up his phone and dialed Cheney, peppering her with a final volley of queries. Would Herrera Beutler be a reliable witness? Were there others who might follow her lead? What did she think about calling witnesses in general? Cheney agreed with the move. Herrera Beutler, she assured Raskin, was an honorable woman who would tell the truth under oath. She would not grandstand. And better yet, she would make a compelling witness. That was all Raskin needed to hear: If Cheney trusted her, then he would as well.\n Just before 9:40 a.m., with the start of the trial 20 minutes away and still no word from Herrera Beutler, Raskin called the bustling anteroom to attention. Managers and staff dutifully gathered around a coffee table in the center of the room, filling an embroidered couch and chairs set up in a big circle. Once the room quieted, Raskin turned to his lead attorney, whom he knew was the most pro-witness of the bunch.\n “Barry, what do you think we should do?” he asked.\n “We don’t have a choice,” Berke responded. “We have to call witnesses.”\n “Yes, you’re right,” Raskin declared.\n \n A ripple of excitement spread through the team as managers seconded the decision with sighs of relief and cheers of Absolutely! and Yes! Immediately everyone jumped up to recalibrate their plans. In one corner, Matz, Berke and Hiller began frantically rewriting Raskin’s opening statement for the day. How would Trump’s attorneys react? And how will we respond to that response? No one knew.\n “Just write something fast!” one attorney shouted as they began scribbling a makeshift script.\n The other managers, meanwhile, began to plan their next steps. DeGette volunteered to try again to get ahold of Herrera Beutler, whom she’d been trying to reach all morning. Others began plotting when and how they could depose her if she agreed to testify. Would she come back to town today? If not, was a video interview possible? As a staffer informed Schumer’s team of their last-minute change in plans, Raskin made the most important phone call of all. In a dramatic departure from the first impeachment, Pelosi had let Raskin make the day-to-day decisions for the trial, as she promised she would. But this was a big enough shift that the speaker deserved a heads-up, Raskin reasoned. He gave her a chance to object, but he did not ask her permission.\n “We’ve got to go for this,” he told her. “We’ve got an opening.”\n “I trust your judgment,” she told Raskin. “It’s up to you.”\n \n  \n At 10 a.m., a Senate aide appeared at the door. It was time to start. As Raskin headed to the floor, he made a quick call to his Republican friend Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) for the first of what would become a series of last-minute sales pitches to unearth possible witnesses. As one of the 10 who had voted to impeach, Raskin figured Katko knew about this McCarthy tale that Herrera Beutler and the CNN story had exposed.\n “Are you willing to testify?” Raskin asked Katko as he walked into the chamber.\n Katko said no. He had heard personally from McCarthy about his Jan. 6 call with Trump, but the New York Republican didn’t mention that and played dumb.\n “I don’t have any relevant information,” he said. “You need Jaime. She’s all you need.”\n Katko would later insist for this book that he offered to testify if subpoenaed and he disputes that he told Raskin that Herrera Beutler “is all you need.” Both statements run contrary to the recollections of five members of the managers’ team who were closely following the mad dash for GOP witnesses that day.\n \n  \n   \n Jaime Herrera Beutler’s cell phone started ringing just after 7 a.m. Pacific time. On the other line, calling from Washington, D.C., one of her aides was in a panic. Raskin had just marched to the Senate floor and shocked the nation by making a pitch to call witnesses as part of a trial — including her. The motion had actually passed, 55 to 45, with almost no debate.\n “Oh my gosh, you’re being talked about in the middle of this!” the aide told her.\n Herrera Beutler was dumbfounded. She knew the managers had been trying to get in touch overnight. But neither Raskin nor DeGette had bothered to tell her that they planned to call her as a witness the next morning. A little heads-up would have been nice. Herrera Beutler was with her family that President’s Day weekend, hoping to get some time off the grid after the chaos following the CNN story the day before. She had not even been watching the trial.\n She flipped the television on. And sure enough, there, in the well of the Senate, Raskin was standing at the podium and citing the statement Herrera Beutler had instructed her staff to release the previous evening as reason to call witnesses. The Senate had no choice but to hear straight from her about “the president’s willful dereliction of duty,” he said.\n “Awesome,” she said sarcastically.\n Just a year before, Herrera Beutler had voted against Trump’s first impeachment, citing Democrats’ process fouls she felt could not be overlooked. She had even voted to reelect Trump in 2020 after refusing to back him in 2016. But Herrera Beutler had been deeply disturbed by what happened on Jan. 6. After evacuating in an astronaut-like escape hood from the balcony of the House chamber, where lawmakers had been trapped longest, she barricaded herself in the office of a fellow female Republican. When Trump went on television to praise his followers as “very special” people, she had lost her usual cool. She was so upset, in fact, that she had decided to record a video in her office around nine o’clock that night. In it she implored the nation to come together and reject fear, albeit without naming Trump specifically. Americans, she argued, had died for this democracy, and those rioters were making a sham of those sacrifices. “I had never thought I’d see this day. I felt like we were under siege!” she said. “Every American should be heartbroken. That’s how I felt.”\n While Herrera Beutler believed Trump had engaged in an impeachable dereliction of duty, she instructed her team to learn exactly what happened at the White House on Jan. 6 before deciding to condemn him. And she pumped her own contacts for info, particularly one well-connected friend: Kevin McCarthy. \n The details McCarthy disclosed about his call with Trump on the afternoon of the 6th had been the deciding factor in Herrera Beutler’s vote. It was clear to her Trump was not only responsible for the violence but had reveled in it. If that didn’t rise to the level of impeachment, she believed, nothing did.\n \n  \n Herrera Beutler had known that her vote would jeopardize her standing with Trump supporters in her GOP district. It was why she made a point of being upfront with constituents and explaining her thinking in interviews with local reporters and in town halls, including the details of her talk with McCarthy. So it came as a bit of a surprise when Liz Cheney called her a few days into the impeachment trial with an unusual request: A CNN reporter had heard about McCarthy’s call with Trump and was trying to confirm it, Cheney told her.\n Herrera Beutler rarely engaged with the national press, but she agreed to be interviewed. The details of McCarthy’s call might prove critical to establishing Trump’s thoughts and motivations. When the story had posted, Herrera Beutler braced for an angry call from McCarthy — but by late Friday night, she still hadn’t heard from him. Instead, it was the Democrats who were leaving frantic messages.\n Herrera Beutler had a pretty good idea of what they wanted. What good investigator wouldn’t want more information on the McCarthy-Trump phone call? But she felt it was not her story to tell; it was McCarthy’s. What’s more, she knew that there were others who could tell a similar tale. Halfway through the trial, before the CNN story shot Herrera Beutler into the spotlight, she had texted the other GOP impeachers to ask if McCarthy had ever shared the story of his Trump call with any of them. Multiple members on the chain — a support group of sorts they had dubbed “the band of brothers” — responded that he had.\n \n After the story broke, Herrera Beutler had instructed her team to issue a press release detailing the McCarthy-Trump call. They closed it with a line encouraging anyone who knew anything to step forward, hoping McCarthy would get the message. “To the patriots who were standing next to the former president as these conversations were happening, or even to the former vice president: If you have something to add here, now would be the time,” it read.\n She then turned her attention back to her family. But on Saturday morning, thanks to Raskin’s surprise move on the Senate floor, her hopes of having a calm weekend flew out the window.\n Herrera Beutler considered her options. She could decline to testify and take the easy way out —or she could do the brave thing and agree to tell her story. It was a choice that would come with consequences either way, she thought. But she had come this far already. After bucking her own party with a vote to impeach, what more was a deposition in the Senate?\n Find me a lawyer, she told her team. She needed professional advice before she took the plunge.\n \n  \n   \n As soon as the motion to call witnesses passed, Schumer called for an emergency recess and Raskin and his team retreated to their holding room. They were awash with adrenaline, but also struck with terror. They had succeeded in upending the trial completely — and they had no idea what to do next.\n Huddled in a corner with Berke and Matz, Raskin began furiously calling sympathetic Republicans to see if any would come forward. He dialed Herrera Beutler again. Still no answer. He left a message. Then he tried Katko again. That too went to voicemail. Steve Womack of Arkansas, a sympathetic GOP lawmaker repulsed by Trump, did pick up the phone. Did he know about the Herrera Beutler story? Did he know anything else that could help them? Raskin asked. Or did he know anyone who did know something — anything? Womack said he did not. Ditto with Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), another House Republican who had voted to impeach and sounded physically pained when Raskin introduced himself and asked for assistance.\n “You should talk to Pence’s people,” Meijer told Raskin, sighing loudly.\n Upton, the friendly Michigander who had indicated that other moderates would not be able to corroborate Herrera Beutler’s story, wasn’t much help either. When asked if he would be willing to be deposed, Upton declined apologetically and simply wished them luck. He, like Katko, still said nothing about how other moderates had heard the same story from McCarthy as Herrera Beutler.\n Outside, Washington was in an ecstatic fervor over Raskin’s surprise move. The city had expected Trump’s second impeachment trial to end that afternoon — but now, it seemed, there was a chance the Senate would be in it for the long haul, and possibly hearing firsthand evidence about Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. Progressive Democrats cheered the managers on, encouraging them not to leave a single stone unturned. Trump supporters panicked, decrying Raskin’s move as a sneak attack and threatening revenge.\n Inside the managers’ room, as Swalwell tried to call Greg Pence, Berke phoned Cooper to see if he’d had any luck finagling permission for Marc Short to testify. Raskin, standing next to him, watched on tenterhooks — and saw his counsel’s face sink. Berke then passed the phone over so Raskin could hear the bad news for himself. Cooper had spoken to Pence’s attorney Richard Cullen: They were not going to cooperate voluntarily. In fact, Pence’s team planned to fight the subpoenas if they were summoned, Cooper said, and had refused to give a preview of what Short might say if called. That meant the managers would have little indication of whether his story was even worth pursuing.\n “Don’t fuck this up by calling witnesses you might not get,” Cooper told Raskin candidly. “You have a good case right now…If I were you, I don’t think I’d want to risk the record you have... How does it get better? It sure as hell can get worse.”\n Cooper’s words gave Raskin pause. The influential conservative lawyer was a partisan, but in that moment he was also their ally — and to date, he had been straight with them. If he thought they should drop this effort, maybe they should listen.\n “Well, that came up . . . Short,” Raskin joked awkwardly, making the obvious pun with the elusive witness’s surname.\n A few minutes later, Swalwell came back relaying his own deadend: Greg Pence hadn’t even answered his phone.\n \n  \n In the midst of the commotion, Senator Chris Coons walked through the door. The stocky lawyer from Delaware with a purposeful demeanor was a committed Democratic moderate known around the building as Biden’s closest ally in the Senate. Though he had just voted for witnesses, Coons couldn’t understand the logic of the managers’ gambit. And he was worried about the trial dragging out and hurting the new president. In fact, Trump’s defense lawyers, furious and blindsided by Raskin’s witness move, had vowed just before the vote that if Raskin called even one witness, they would seek to depose at least one hundred of their own, including Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris. That meant possibly hours of floor debate about which witnesses were relevant — and possibly days or weeks of testimony that could overshadow Biden’s presidency until late February or March. It was a threat that met its mark, as senators on the floor, including other Democrats who had just backed Raskin’s witness strategy, fretted about having to endure elongated proceedings. What’s more, Several Republicans had indicated to Coons that they were ready to convict the president — but if the trial spun out of control, there was no telling what might happen.\n With those frustrations in mind, Coons had marched into Schumer’s office and demanded to know what the hell was going on. Schumer had permitted the vote, but he also was befuddled by Raskin’s move. He told Coons he didn’t know what Raskin’s game plan was. The Democratic leader was skeptical the ploy would work anyway. If running for their lives on Jan. 6 wasn’t enough to persuade Republicans to convict Trump, then it was hard to believe any other witness would, Schumer reasoned. Coons, who held a similar mindset, offered to go talk to Raskin’s team himself to shut the entire thing down. When Schumer gave him the nod, the senator headed to find the managers.\n “I know when a jury is ready to vote, and this jury is ready to vote,” Coons declared when he entered the managers’ room.\n As the team gathered around him, Coons argued that Republicans had already made up their minds and that calling witnesses was a waste of time. Democrats, he argued, had bigger fish to fry: Biden still needed the Senate to confirm most of his Cabinet, and he had a legislative agenda to get onto the floor.\n “Dragging this out will not be good for the American project or for the American people. We’re trying to do a lot,” he said, choosing terms that sounded to the managers like they came straight from the White House. Coons floated a possible compromise: Have Herrera Beutler make a written affidavit detailing her story, Coons instructed. Then, let the defense get a statement from McCarthy and be done with it.\n “I’m not taking that deal,” Raskin said flatly, stunned that Coons, as a fellow lawyer, would expect any prosecutor to entertain such unsavory terms. “No way are we allowing McCarthy to deny Herrera Beutler’s story without cross-examining him.”\n But Coons was adamant. “You’re going to lose Republican votes,” he warned them. “Everyone here wants to go home. They have flights for Valentine’s Day. Some of them are already missing their flights.”\n Berke jumped in, telling Coons the managers hoped to depose Herrera Beutler and McCarthy by video conference that very day. “Listen, Senator, we hear you on the delay,” he said. “But I have to tell you this is going to go quickly ... And we can do closing arguments tomorrow.”\n Coons was incredulous at Berke’s naïveté. “That’s nuts!” he shot back. McCarthy would never agree to testify before retaining counsel, he retorted. If they were lucky — and that was a big if — it would take days to depose the GOP leader, not hours.\n “I encourage you all to just do affidavits,” Coons said sternly. “Do it today and reach a swift resolution.”\n As he turned to leave, Coons added one more thing. “And just to be clear,” he said over his shoulder, “I’m here speaking only for myself.”\n When the door closed behind him, the room broke into collective outrage.\n \n “Are you fucking kidding me?” Cicilline said, turning to Neguse. “We are impeaching a president of the United States for inciting a violent insurrection against the government, and these motherfuckers want to go home for Valentine’s Day? Really?”\n He wasn’t the only one who felt that way. The managers viewed their jobs as one of the most serious things they would ever do in their lives. And yet their own party was pressuring them so they could go enjoy the long weekend. How shortsighted. How repugnant. And how disrespectful.\n But for Raskin, Coons’ warnings began to revive the doubts that had plagued him earlier that morning. They had succeeded in getting the Senate to agree to witnesses in concept — but the truth was, they still didn’t have any witnesses in hand. Moreover, everyone in the room agreed that Coons wasn’t actually speaking for himself. He might deny it, but his words were as good as a warning from Biden. Despite the uneasiness caused by Coons’ words, the managers continued to forge ahead.\n Berke, Plaskett and Swalwell began working on questions for a potential cross-examination of McCarthy about his Trump call. Others, including Raskin, debated whether McCarthy would be willing to commit perjury under oath to protect Trump — or if he’d deny the Herrera Beutler story altogether, pitching the trial into an unresolvable he-said-she-said spat that would give Republicans another excuse to acquit.\n Raskin called Cheney again to get her take. “If we call McCarthy, will he be honest?” Raskin asked.\n On the other end of the line, Cheney thought about all the times McCarthy had flip-flopped, vowing to do one thing — then doing the exact opposite.\n “I don’t know,” she admitted.\n It was a deflating turn of events for the managers, who still weren’t ready to throw in the towel. They started brainstorming backup plans. “Maybe we give up on McCarthy and Short, and just subpoena Herrera Beutler,” one of them suggested. “Or we could subpoena just her notes to buy some time,” another offered.\n “We should delay the final vote at all costs so we can get the votes to convict,” Lieu declared. “And buy time to see if we can get in touch with anyone willing to tell their story.”\n Berke, seizing on the managers’ energy, offered an even more aggressive suggestion: So what if no one was offering to testify? Let’s call their bluff and ask the Senate to subpoena these witnesses anyway, he proposed. If acquittal was the alternative, what did they have to lose?\n \n  \n But Raskin wasn’t so sure he agreed. During Trump’s first impeachment trial, impeachment attorneys had argued that the courts would settle any disputes over Trump’s claims to privilege or immunity within a matter of weeks due to the serious nature of a Senate trial. The fact that Trump was no longer in the Oval Office — and could no longer make such claims — should have made their subpoenas even less vulnerable to lengthy court challenges. Yet in the heat of the moment, those same impeachment lawyers on Raskin’s team started losing their earlier confidence about the speed of judicial review. They began to ask themselves: What if these impeachment subpoenas turned out to be no different from their fight over former White House counsel Don McGahn, which was still crawling through the courts almost two years later?\n Further complicating that calculus was the Trump team’s vow to call a hundred witnesses. Technically, the threat was hollow. The Senate — not Trump’s lawyers and not the managers — had the ultimate authority to approve which subpoenas to issue by a simple majority vote. That meant Trump’s team could try to summon Pelosi or Harris or whomever they wanted, but as long as Senate Democrats stuck together, their efforts would fail. Nonetheless, the House managers began to worry. The time it would take to hold such partisan witness votes might undercut the impact of their presentations, some argued.\n “This isn’t working,” Matz pushed back on Berke. “We do have something to lose: time, momentum, credibility and persuasion.”\n As they deliberated, Schumer’s counsel, Mark Patterson, arrived with another possible deal to end the trial without witnesses. He’d been trying to negotiate a way out with the Trump team through McConnell’s counsel Andrew Ferguson, who also wanted to bring the trial to a swift end. They had all come to an agreement that “we are prepared to accept,” Patterson told Berke: the Trump team would allow Herrera Beutler’s statement to be entered into the record without any sort of retort from McCarthy — so long as the managers promised not to call a single witness.\n Patterson indicated that he thought the managers should take the deal.\n \n Raskin was still wrestling with the decision when Coons appeared a second time at the doorway to hammer home his end-the-trial message. Republican senators were organizing to hamstring the managers’ witness plans, he declared. Two dozen of them had already decided they were in lockstep with Trump’s lawyer’s threat: If the managers called even one witness, they would force votes to call Pelosi, Harris and dozens more.\n “Everybody wants to go home,” the Delaware senator said impatiently. “Everybody is pissed, and this trial will unzip if even a single vote on a witness occurs.”\n The managers recoiled at Coons’ accusing tone.\n “We also answer to the American people, Senator!” Stacey Plaskett exploded.\n Coons took a deep breath. “Look, you have somewhere between 54 to 56 votes to convict, but you are losing a vote per hour,” Coons said, his annoyance escalating. “You have to make a decision. You’ve got to do it within the hour. Nobody’s mind is really open at this point.”\n With that, Coons disappeared again, and a pall fell over the room. The president’s unofficial interlocutor might as well have just clipped their wings — and the managers were plummeting back to reality. The Delaware senator’s warning that they might be losing the room to jury fatigue — just like Schiff’s team had during Trump’s first impeachment — petrified them. They’d been adamant that they would do their utmost to secure as many Republican votes as they could; now the suggestion that they could be undermining their own efforts by simply trying to unearth the truth was shocking — and crushing.\n \n  \n The managers couldn’t believe they had found themselves in such a position. They had been chosen by the Speaker of the House to bring charges against a president who had incited an attack against a co-equal branch of government that had resulted in death and destruction and could have cost lawmakers’ lives. Calling witnesses to prosecute that outrage should have transcended any partisan roadblocks or practical inconveniences. It hadn’t. Even Senate Democrats — the people who were supposed to be their allies — were putting intense pressure on them to wrap up so they could move on to other things. Could they not appreciate that this was Congress’s last chance to oust Trump from American politics for good?\n Raskin knew his decision went beyond the tribulations of one political party. Trump was already on the rebound, with polls showing Republican voters once again rallying around him and GOP lawmakers growing more comfortable with re-embracing him. If there were ever a moment to stop that trend, or reverse it, the moment was now. Raskin had one shot at a captive audience in the Senate, as well as the millions of potential voters watching across the nation.\n Raskin might have been willing to risk all the political complexities of plowing forward —including the wrath of his own party — but for one glaring problem: In the two hours since the Senate vote, not a single witness had stepped forward. He had no idea that Herrera Beutler’s staffers, at that exact moment, were frantically reaching out to lawyers, hoping to consult one before she agreed to testify. She had even sought assistance from Pelosi’s House counsel Doug Letter, though Letter said he could not help her because he was working with the managers. He never conveyed her interest to Raskin.\n As the managers looked to him to make a decision, Raskin felt his hands were tied. He had always known it would be a longshot to get a Republican to testify against Trump. Still, he had hoped the gravity of the moment would compel at least one of them to step into the spotlight and put the good of the republic before the pull of their party. It came as a gut punch to realize that when he needed it most, there was no help to be found. Even after a president had tried to lay waste to the fundamental tenets of representative democracy, politics — not principle — was still king of the Hill.\n Not 10 minutes after Coons left, Raskin caved.\n “Let’s take the deal,” he said.\n Adapted from UNCHECKED: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump by Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian, to be published Oct. 18 by William Morrow.

Cheri Bustos, was redrawn to give her party an easier path, but the district could still land in Republican hands.\n “These aren’t easy districts. Politics are very different once you get outside of Cook County and the collar counties” around Chicago, the five-term Bustos said in an interview. “You have to have the right candidate and the right message to be successful in these downstate districts.”\n The last thing Bustos, a friend of Pelosi, wants to do is pass the 17th District baton to a Republican.\n But with the prospect of losing the House if the GOP wins just six seats in November, Democrats are finding that even places they carved out for themselves are frustratingly competitive as economic concerns spook voters.\n \n \n Bustos is backing Democrat Eric Sorensen, a TV meteorologist, facing Republican Esther Joy King, an Army JAG officer who entered the race with strong name recognition after losing to Bustos by 6 points in 2020.\n The 17th encompasses the populous Rockford and Quad Cities areas in the northwestern region of Illinois and was notable as one of the few areas in the country that elected a Democrat to Congress while also backing Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n With Democrats in control of the Illinois statehouse, a greater edge was given to their party during the redistricting process — but it might not be enough to guarantee a win.

It’s straight out of Cheri’s playbook, emphasizing the economy,” said Robin Johnson, a Monmouth College professor and longtime pollster on Illinois policy issues. “King learned from her loss about the proper message to take to the district.”\n But King is already taking hits from Democrats with an ad by the House Majority PAC that calls her a “fraud” and claims she embellished her biography and the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee is out with an ad that calls out her anti-abortion views.\n Sorensen, meanwhile, is a first-time political candidate with name recognition in the Rockford and Quad Cities area. His campaign is focusing on economic issues such as the cost of food and health care, bringing jobs to the district and addressing climate change. Sorensen also would be the first openly gay member of the Illinois congressional delegation if he’s elected.\n King has $1.3 million cash on hand after raising $1.2 million in the third quarter, and Sorenson has raised $1.5 million in the third quarter, according to their campaigns.\n “With apologies to Bob Dylan, maybe you do need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,” deadpanned Eric Adelstein, a political strategist who has consulted for Barack Obama, Lori Lightfoot and the Democratic National Committee. “It’s a highly competitive race that could go either way. There’s a lot of spending.”\n \n \n Sorensen wasn’t the first pick among those in Bustos’ circle. He won a highly contested primary against a former state representative and a city council member who was backed by people who had worked on Bustos’ campaign.\n Illinois’ other open seat, the newly formed 13th District, was gerrymandered as a landing spot for Democrat Nikki Budzinski, a budget aide who left the Biden White House in 2021 to run with support from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).\n The eel-shaped 13th leans more Democratic, according to POLITICO’s Election Forecast, than the more conservative 17th District seat.\n \n But that isn’t easing the worries of some Democrats.\n “I’m concerned. There’s a lot of disinformation out there and there are a lot of election deniers. The misinformation creates an environment that could hurt turnout for Democrats,” Wayne Williams, a county Democratic leader in Budzinski’s district, said in an interview. “There’s also a lot less door-to-door interaction than four years ago. I have concerns as someone who doesn’t want to see an anti-choice Republican win the seat.”\n The 13th District captures African American and university communities from within East St. Louis to Springfield, Decatur and Champaign-Urbana. It’s a thin swath that voted for President Joe Biden by 11 points in 2020.\n The contest is close enough that Clem Balanoff, an Illinois campaign adviser and longtime party political operative, says Democrats “are going to put everything they have into the race” to assure Budzinski’s success. Balanoff advised Jonathan Jackson in his Democratic primary victory to fill Rep. Bobby Rush’s seat.\n That at least was the case until this week. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is now pulling money out of IL-13, according to AdImpact, a sign of confidence in Budzinski.\n Budzinski, who also was an aide to Gov. JB Pritzker, has organized labor on her side and is better funded than her competitor, Republican Regan Deering.\n Still, Democrats are watching Deering, the granddaughter of the late farming industrialist Dwayne Andreas, who headed Archer Daniels Midland, fearing she could fill her campaign coffers quickly in the waning weeks before Election Day. Deering raised $1 million in the third quarter, according to her campaign.\n The National Republican Congressional Committee has named Deering one of its 2022 Young Guns, which channels attention and organizational support to budding campaigns. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee added Budzinski to its “Red to Blue” program that similarly helps promising candidates.\n Budzinski’s team says it’s not taking anything for granted, particularly as inflation remains stubbornly high and Biden’s approval ratings remain underwater.\n \n The big question mark in both the IL-13 and IL-17 races, as it is across the country, is the extent to which the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade plays in the November election.\n Balanoff, the Illinois operative, expects voter interest to continue shifting before November.\n “If the election were held today, I think Democrats would win both seats. But it’s two more months, and that’s an eternity,” he said at the time, adding what would be a prescient comment. “One bad break and things change dramatically. What if OPEC said they were to cut production and prices go up? You just never know.”","dc:creator":"Shia Kapos","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/a7/36/5064f0f84df293fb47a42867b291/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/961358492"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Illinois’ 17th District seat, a district held by outgoing Democratic Rep.

Now she herself chants slogans like “Death to the Dictator!” with a fury she didn’t know she had, as she joins protests calling for toppling the country’s rulers.</p> <p>Sharo said that after three weeks of protests, triggered by the death of a young woman in the custody of the feared morality police, anger at the authorities is only rising, despite a bloody crackdown that has left dozens dead and hundreds in detention.</p> <p>“The situation here is tense and volatile,” she said, referring to the city of Sanandaj in the majority Kurdish home district of the same name in northwestern Iran, one of the hot spots of the protests.</p> <p>“We are just waiting for something to happen, like a time-bomb,” she said, speaking to The Associated Press via Telegram messenger service.</p> <p>The anti-government protests in Sanandaj, 300 miles from the capital, are a microcosm of the leaderless protests that have roiled Iran.</p> <p>Led largely by women and youth, they have evolved from spontaneous mass gatherings in central areas to scattered demonstrations in residential areas, schools and universities as activists try to evade an increasingly brutal crackdown.</p> <p>Tensions rose again Saturday in Sanandaj after rights monitors said two protesters were shot dead and several were wounded, following a resumption of demonstrations. Residents said there has been a heavy security presence in the city, with constant patrols and security personnel stationed on major streets.</p> <p>The Associated Press spoke to six female activists in Sanandaj who said suppression tactics, including beatings, arrests, the use of live ammunition and internet disruptions make it difficult at times to keep the momentum going. Yet protests persist, along with other expressions of civil disobedience, such as commercial strikes and drivers honking horns at security forces.</p> <p>The activists in the city spoke on the condition their full names be withheld fearing reprisals by Iranian authorities. Their accounts were corroborated by three human rights monitors.</p> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">THE BURIAL</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\"></h4> <p>Three weeks ago, the news of the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police in Tehran spread rapidly across her home province of Kurdistan, of which Sanandaj is the capital. The response was swift in the impoverished and historically marginalized area.</p> <p> As the burial was underway in Amini’s town of Saqqez on Sept. 17, protesters were already filling Sanandaj’s main thoroughfare, activists said.</p> <p>People of all ages were present and began chanting slogans that would be repeated in cities across Iran: “Woman. Life. Freedom.”</p> <p>The Amini family had been under pressure from the government to bury Mahsa quickly before a critical mass of protesters formed, said Afsanah, a 38-year-old clothing designer from Saqqez. She was at the burial that day and followed the crowds from the cemetery to the city square.</p> <p>Rozan, a 32-year old housewife, didn’t know Amini personally. But when she heard the young woman had died in the custody of the morality police in Tehran and had been arrested for violating the Islamic Republic’s hijab rules, she felt compelled to take to the street that day.</p> <p>“The same thing happened to me,” she said. In 2013, like Amini, she had ventured to the capital with a friend when she was apprehended by the morality police because her abaya, or loose robe that is part of the mandatory dress code, was too short. She was taken to the same facility where Amini later died, and fingerprinted and made to sign a declaration of guilt.</p> <p>“It could have been me,” she said. In the years since then Rozan, a former nurse, was fired from the local government health department for being too vocal about her views about women’s rights.</p> <p>After the funeral, she saw an elderly woman take a step forward and in one swift gesture, remove her headscarf. “I felt inspired to do the same,” she said.</p> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\"></h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">SUPPRESSION</h4> <p>In the first three days after the burial, protesters were plucked from the demonstrations in arrest sweeps in Sanandaj. By the end of the week, arrests targeted known activists and protest organizers.</p> <p>Dunya, a lawyer, said she was one among a small group of women’s rights activists who helped organize protests. They also asked shopkeepers to respect a call for a commercial strike along the city’s main streets.</p> <p>“Almost all the women in our group are in jail now,” she said.</p> <p>Internet blackouts made it difficult for protesters to communicate with one another across cities and with the outside world.</p> <p>“We would wake up in the morning and have no idea what was happening,” said Sharo, the university graduate. The internet would return intermittently, often late at night or during working hours, but swiftly cut off in the late afternoon, the time many would gather to protest.</p> <p>The heavy security presence also prevented mass gatherings.</p> <p>“There are patrols in almost every street, and they break up groups, even if its just two or three people walking on the street,” said Sharo.</p> <p>During demonstrations security forces fired pellet guns and tear gas at the crowd causing many to run. Security personnel on motorcycles also drove into crowds in an effort to disperse them.</p> <p>All activists interviewed said they either witnessed or heard live ammunition. Iranian authorities have so far denied this, blaming separatist groups on occasions when the use of live fire was verified. The two protesters killed Saturday in Sanandaj were killed by live fire, according to the France-based Kurdistan Human Rights network.</p> <p>Protesters say fear is a close companion. The wounded were often reluctant to use ambulances or go to hospitals, worried they might get arrested. Activists also suspected government informants were trying to blend in with the crowds.</p> <p>But acts of resistance have continued.</p> <p>“I assure you the protests are not over,” said Sharo. “The people are angry, they are talking back to the police in ways I have never seen.”</p> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">DISOBEDIENCE</h4> <p>The anger runs deep. In Sanandaj the confluence of three factors has rendered the city a ripe ground for protest activity — a history of Kurdish resistance, rising poverty and a long history of women’s rights activism.</p> <p>Yet the protests are not defined along ethnic or regional lines even though they were sparked in a predominantly Kurdish area, said Tara Sepehri Fars, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. “It’s been very unique in that sense,” she said.</p> <p>There have been waves of protest in Iran in recent years, the largest in 2009 bringing large crowds into the streets after what protesters felt was a stolen election. But the continued defiance and demands for regime change during the current wave seem to pose the most serious challenge in years to the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>Like most of Iran, Sanandaj has suffered as U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic devastated the economy and spurred inflation.

Now she herself chants slogans like “Death to the Dictator!” with a fury she didn’t know she had, as she joins protests calling for toppling the country’s rulers.\n Sharo said that after three weeks of protests, triggered by the death of a young woman in the custody of the feared morality police, anger at the authorities is only rising, despite a bloody crackdown that has left dozens dead and hundreds in detention.\n “The situation here is tense and volatile,” she said, referring to the city of Sanandaj in the majority Kurdish home district of the same name in northwestern Iran, one of the hot spots of the protests.\n “We are just waiting for something to happen, like a time-bomb,” she said, speaking to The Associated Press via Telegram messenger service.\n The anti-government protests in Sanandaj, 300 miles from the capital, are a microcosm of the leaderless protests that have roiled Iran.\n Led largely by women and youth, they have evolved from spontaneous mass gatherings in central areas to scattered demonstrations in residential areas, schools and universities as activists try to evade an increasingly brutal crackdown.\n Tensions rose again Saturday in Sanandaj after rights monitors said two protesters were shot dead and several were wounded, following a resumption of demonstrations. Residents said there has been a heavy security presence in the city, with constant patrols and security personnel stationed on major streets.\n The Associated Press spoke to six female activists in Sanandaj who said suppression tactics, including beatings, arrests, the use of live ammunition and internet disruptions make it difficult at times to keep the momentum going. Yet protests persist, along with other expressions of civil disobedience, such as commercial strikes and drivers honking horns at security forces.\n The activists in the city spoke on the condition their full names be withheld fearing reprisals by Iranian authorities. Their accounts were corroborated by three human rights monitors.\n THE BURIAL\n \n Three weeks ago, the news of the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police in Tehran spread rapidly across her home province of Kurdistan, of which Sanandaj is the capital. The response was swift in the impoverished and historically marginalized area.\n  As the burial was underway in Amini’s town of Saqqez on Sept. 17, protesters were already filling Sanandaj’s main thoroughfare, activists said.\n People of all ages were present and began chanting slogans that would be repeated in cities across Iran: “Woman. Life. Freedom.”\n The Amini family had been under pressure from the government to bury Mahsa quickly before a critical mass of protesters formed, said Afsanah, a 38-year-old clothing designer from Saqqez. She was at the burial that day and followed the crowds from the cemetery to the city square.\n Rozan, a 32-year old housewife, didn’t know Amini personally. But when she heard the young woman had died in the custody of the morality police in Tehran and had been arrested for violating the Islamic Republic’s hijab rules, she felt compelled to take to the street that day.\n “The same thing happened to me,” she said. In 2013, like Amini, she had ventured to the capital with a friend when she was apprehended by the morality police because her abaya, or loose robe that is part of the mandatory dress code, was too short. She was taken to the same facility where Amini later died, and fingerprinted and made to sign a declaration of guilt.\n “It could have been me,” she said. In the years since then Rozan, a former nurse, was fired from the local government health department for being too vocal about her views about women’s rights.\n After the funeral, she saw an elderly woman take a step forward and in one swift gesture, remove her headscarf. “I felt inspired to do the same,” she said.\n \n SUPPRESSION\n In the first three days after the burial, protesters were plucked from the demonstrations in arrest sweeps in Sanandaj. By the end of the week, arrests targeted known activists and protest organizers.\n Dunya, a lawyer, said she was one among a small group of women’s rights activists who helped organize protests. They also asked shopkeepers to respect a call for a commercial strike along the city’s main streets.\n “Almost all the women in our group are in jail now,” she said.\n Internet blackouts made it difficult for protesters to communicate with one another across cities and with the outside world.\n “We would wake up in the morning and have no idea what was happening,” said Sharo, the university graduate. The internet would return intermittently, often late at night or during working hours, but swiftly cut off in the late afternoon, the time many would gather to protest.\n The heavy security presence also prevented mass gatherings.\n “There are patrols in almost every street, and they break up groups, even if its just two or three people walking on the street,” said Sharo.\n During demonstrations security forces fired pellet guns and tear gas at the crowd causing many to run. Security personnel on motorcycles also drove into crowds in an effort to disperse them.\n All activists interviewed said they either witnessed or heard live ammunition. Iranian authorities have so far denied this, blaming separatist groups on occasions when the use of live fire was verified. The two protesters killed Saturday in Sanandaj were killed by live fire, according to the France-based Kurdistan Human Rights network.\n Protesters say fear is a close companion. The wounded were often reluctant to use ambulances or go to hospitals, worried they might get arrested. Activists also suspected government informants were trying to blend in with the crowds.\n But acts of resistance have continued.\n “I assure you the protests are not over,” said Sharo. “The people are angry, they are talking back to the police in ways I have never seen.”\n DISOBEDIENCE\n The anger runs deep. In Sanandaj the confluence of three factors has rendered the city a ripe ground for protest activity — a history of Kurdish resistance, rising poverty and a long history of women’s rights activism.\n Yet the protests are not defined along ethnic or regional lines even though they were sparked in a predominantly Kurdish area, said Tara Sepehri Fars, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. “It’s been very unique in that sense,” she said.\n There have been waves of protest in Iran in recent years, the largest in 2009 bringing large crowds into the streets after what protesters felt was a stolen election. But the continued defiance and demands for regime change during the current wave seem to pose the most serious challenge in years to the Islamic Republic.\n Like most of Iran, Sanandaj has suffered as U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic devastated the economy and spurred inflation. Far from the capital, in the fringes of the country, its majority Kurdish residents are eyed with suspicion by the regime.\n By the third week, with the opening of universities and schools, students began holding small rallies and joined the movement.\n Videos circulated on social media showing students jeering school masters, school girls removing their headscarves on the street and chanting: “One by one they will kill us, if we don’t stand together.”\n One university student said they were planning on boycotting classes altogether.\n Afsanah, the clothing designer, said that she likes wearing the headscarf. “But I am protesting because it was never my choice.”\n Her parents, fearing for her safety, tried to persuade her to stay home. But she disobeyed them, pretending to go to work in the morning only to search for protest gatherings around the city.\n “I am angry, and I am without fear — we just need this feeling to overflow on the street,” she said.","dc:creator":"Associated Press","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/59/42/763f35c44abfa17a7fde0b09be73/iran-anatomy-of-protest-47458.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Tear gas is fired by security to disperse protesters in front of the Tehran University, Iran., on Oct. 1.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/59/42/763f35c44abfa17a7fde0b09be73/iran-anatomy-of-protest-47458.jpg"}}]},"content":"The anti-government protests in Sanandaj, 300 miles from the capital, are a microcosm of the leaderless protests that have roiled Iran.","contentSnippet":"The anti-government protests in Sanandaj, 300 miles from the capital, are a microcosm of the leaderless protests that have roiled Iran.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/09/anger-rising-iran-protests-00061065","isoDate":"2022-10-09T10:52:50.000Z"},{"creator":"Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein","title":"High court seems chilly to ‘race neutral’ reading of Voting Rights Act","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/04/high-court-race-neutral-voting-rights-act-00060270","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 13:06:03 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/0b/19/b20b9a404b42a537cde04967bb38/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1430056014\"> <br> <p>A majority of the Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to embrace an argument advanced by Alabama calling for a “race neutral” reading of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.</p> <p>But the justices nonetheless signaled that there could be changes coming to the enforcement of the landmark 1965 legislation.</p> <p>The case revolves around a challenge to Alabama’s newly redrawn maps for the state’s seven Congressional districts.

The Buccaneers star and Bündchen had been spotted without their wedding rings. \n CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n People magazine reported Bündchen and Brady have both hired divorce lawyers and that Bündchen had been working with one for \"weeks.\" According to Page Six, both Brady and Bündchen have hired attorneys and are figuring out how to separate their assets.\n But for at least three hours on Sunday, Brady put the drama in the rearview to take care of business against the Falcons.\n He was 35-for-52 passing with 351 passing yards and a touchdown pass to Leonard Fournette. Tampa Bay picked up their third win of the season and helped regain first place in the NFC South.\n It was the second straight game Brady had surpassed the 300-yard passing mark and the first time he did it in back-to-back regular season games since Weeks 16 and 17 of last season. According to The Associated Press, it was Brady’s 40th 300-yard game after turning 40.\n ANTONIO BROWN INJECTS HIMSELF INTO TOM BRADY'S REPORTED MARRIAGE WOES WITH CRUDE TWEET\n Brady hasn’t spoken openly about his personal life as rumors started to swirl about him and Bündchen last month. On Sept. 19’s episode of the \"Let’s Go!\" podcast, Brady said he needed to do a better job of keeping his emotions in check. It was the day after he slammed a tablet down in frustration.\n \"I've gotta be really mindful of that going forward and getting my emotions in a good place so it allows me to be the best player I can be. I think there's an importance where you can become too overly emotional, which I definitely think I was yesterday.\"\n When pressed about what was making him so emotional, Brady answered, \"I just think there's a very high standard that we've all set… And I think part of that's a challenge as you become an older athlete.

But “this is so small in the world of restorative justice in cannabis.”\n Here’s a look at what Biden’s executive actions do — and don’t do — and what it could mean for America’s burgeoning multi-billion-dollar marijuana markets.\n \n \n Biden’s drug policy evolution\n Biden long cast himself as a drug warrior during his time in the Senate. In 1989, he criticized George H.W. Bush’s anti-drug plan as “not tough enough.”\n He then went on to play an instrumental role in the 1994 crime bill that helped dramatically increase incarceration rates for drug offenses in America. It included sentencing provisions like the three-strikes rule that state governments also adopted, which had a big impact on drug incarceration rates, including for marijuana offenses.\n That history followed Biden into his campaign for president, which Democratic primary opponents latched onto as an indication that he was out of step with the American public.\n During the campaign, Biden said he supported moving marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II in the Controlled Substances Act. But he also said he supported decriminalizing marijuana use, which advocates expressed confusion over — given that cocaine is a Schedule II substance and still very much criminalized.\n The Biden administration also infuriated cannabis advocates last year when the Daily Beast reported that “dozens” of young White House staffers had been suspended, asked to resign or placed in a remote work program after admitting to prior marijuana use.\n \n \n Who gets a pardon?\n While presidents have the power to grant pardons and clemency through the U.S. Constitution, the type of blanket pardon Biden used is not very common.\n President Gerald Ford issued blanket amnesty in 1974 to Vietnam War deserters. And in 1977, President Jimmy Carter granted unconditional pardons to hundreds of thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers.\n Biden’s action is limited to people with federal convictions for simple possession of marijuana, which a senior administration official estimated will affect about 6,500 people.\n But the vast majority of people who have been negatively affected by federal marijuana enforcement are those who were convicted of more serious crimes, like trafficking and distribution. While Biden has said that no one should be locked up for using marijuana, there are few people — if any — currently incarcerated solely for a federal marijuana possession charge.\n The vast majority of people locked up for marijuana possession were convicted at the state level. Biden’s order also calls on governors to issue pardons for state marijuana possession offenses, but the president has no authority to compel them to act. Many states that have legalized marijuana have already taken steps to scrap old convictions for marijuana crimes. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, issued pardons for more than 11,000 marijuana-related convictions at the end of 2019.\n \n How would Biden’s action impact those who receive pardons?\n People with criminal records also often face discrimination when it comes to accessing housing, jobs or educational opportunities. “This pardon will help relieve those collateral consequences,” the senior administration official said.\n But advocates question whether that’s true.\n “A pardon still leaves all the [criminal] records intact,” said Craig Cesal, who served 19 years in federal prison for marijuana-related crimes and now advocates for other people with cannabis convictions. He was granted clemency last year.\n Their record could still hurt employment opportunities, Cesal explained, like getting approval to transport hazardous materials under a commercial driver's license.\n Biden has directed Attorney General Merrick Garland to develop an administrative process to issue certificates of pardon to those eligible, according to the senior official.\n But that isn’t exactly an easy lift. There is no central database of federal marijuana offenders. State and local prosecutors have also run into trouble trying to automatically expunge cannabis-related criminal records.\n Can Biden unilaterally loosen federal restrictions on marijuana?\n No. Biden instructed the attorney general and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to start the process of reviewing marijuana’s status under federal law.\n There are two other ways the federal government could decriminalize marijuana. Congress could pass a law doing so since it created the Controlled Substances Act, where marijuana is classified as Schedule I, defined as having no medical use and high potential for abuse. Heroin and LSD are also Schedule I drugs. In addition, a citizen can petition the Drug Enforcement Administration to review marijuana’s scheduling.\n While Biden can ask the attorney general to start the review, his power to dictate the details is severely limited. Now, the Food and Drug Administration and DEA will decide how to proceed.\n \n What’s the rescheduling or descheduling process?\n When the agency heads initiate the review process, the task is delegated to the DEA and FDA.\n The FDA’s role is to go through a scientific and medical analysis and to make a recommendation on scheduling to the DEA. The agency’s determination hinges on three factors: currently accepted medical use, the potential for abuse, and a drug’s addictive tendencies, explained Shane Pennington, an attorney at Vicente Sederberg who has been litigating challenges against DEA's marijuana classification for several years.\n While alcohol and tobacco certainly have abuse potential, those drugs have statutory exemptions from the CSA.\n “On matters of science and medical issues — the FDA view trumps DEA,” Pennington said.\n But the DEA has discretion to overrule the FDA’s recommendation in certain situations, including whether it thinks a scheduling decision might run afoul of international drug treaties.\n \n What happens next?\n If the DEA and FDA do decide there is enough scientific evidence to warrant a change in marijuana’s federal status, pro-legalization advocates worry that the drug may be moved to Schedule II or Schedule III, instead of being removed from the CSA entirely.\n That could potentially jeopardize existing state-regulated marijuana markets, because it would put marijuana in the purview of FDA drug regulations. Existing Schedule II drugs include cocaine, fentanyl and methamphetamine, while Schedule III drugs include ketamine and anabolic steroids.\n “Biden is trying to signal what is going to be a paradigm shift and policy shift at the White House in the next two years,” Holland said.","dc:creator":"Mona Zhang","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/a0/31/1788811d4517a002919dcddcff8f/biden-41520.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"President Joe Biden long cast himself as a drug warrior during his time in the Senate.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/a0/31/1788811d4517a002919dcddcff8f/biden-41520.jpg"}}]},"content":"Here’s a look at what Joe Biden’s executive actions do — and don’t do — and what it could mean for America’s burgeoning multibillion-dollar marijuana markets.","contentSnippet":"Here’s a look at what Joe Biden’s executive actions do — and don’t do — and what it could mean for America’s burgeoning multibillion-dollar marijuana markets.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/07/biden-weed-executive-action-dea-00060978","isoDate":"2022-10-07T18:31:14.000Z"},{"title":"4 Weeks Out, Senate Control Hangs in the Balance in Tumultuous Midterms","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/us/politics/senate-midterm-elections.html","pubDate":"Sun, 09 Oct 2022 00:29:59 +0000","media:content":{"$":{"height":"151","medium":"image","url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/08/multimedia/08pol-stateofplay-1-54b8/08pol-stateofplay-1-54b8-moth.jpg","width":"151"}},"content":"The G.O.P. claimed the momentum in the spring.
