The researchers expect to see that share grow to nearly 1-in-5 by 2040.\n Ahead of the midterm election this year, 11 percent of the voting-eligible population identifies as LGBTQ. The projections are a conservative estimate, the researchers noted, because more people continue to come out as they age.\n The report suggests that momentum is driven by the growing number of youth voters and more people coming out in younger generations. Nationally, Gen Z has the highest share of those who are LGBTQ — 27 percent — followed by millenials, with 16 percent who identify as LGBTQ. In 2020, youth turnout was 11 points higher than the previous presidential election, and 17 million young people have turned, or are turning, 18 between the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms.\n “It is safe to assume that LGBTQ+ Americans are, and will increasingly continue to be, an important voting bloc in American elections,” the report says.\n \n \n LGBTQ voters had a historically high turnout in the 2020 presidential election, representing an estimated 7 percent of the electorate. In the 2018 midterms, that was 6 percent.\n Issues involving LGBTQ rights, abortion access and voting access are driving these voters to the polls this year, said Geoff Wetrosky, the Human Rights Campaign’s national campaign director. A Human Rights Campaign survey from earlier this year found 42 percent listed immigration policy reform as a top issue when choosing who to vote for. Another 22 percent cited crime rates in their local areas.\n Republican campaigns are relying heavily on messaging this cycle about crime and immigration. Exit polls from previous elections show that the majority of voters who identify as LGBTQ are Democrats. And Wetrosky said there is a stark partisan divide in terms of who LGBTQ voters support.\n “But our hope is that as politicians of all political parties recognize the changing demographics of the country, and the growth of the LGBTQ voting bloc and the growth of our number of pro-equality allies, that they too will support pro-equality policies,” he said.\n The Senate is voting on legislation to protect same-sex marriage after the election, a delay that senators supporting the deal say will increase its chances of passage. But it does mean Republicans will be able to skirt their records on the issue before the midterms.\n \n “The LGBTQ voting bloc does not act as a monolith, and we do not necessarily only support Democrats, we support pro-equality candidates,” he continued. “We hope that candidates of all parties will recognize that and support pro-equality policies and reach out to LGBTQ voters and seek our votes.”\n The LGBTQ vote can have an impact in battleground states, the report suggests. In both 2030 and 2040, the percentage of eligible voters who are LGBTQ is projected to exceed the national average in Georgia, Arizona, Texas, Nevada and Colorado. Ohio is projected to have the highest percentage change, jumping from 10 percent in 2020 to 18 percent in 2040.\n \n Earlier this year, Agenda PAC, a new liberal super PAC, launched to defeat anti-LGBTQ candidates — with one of the first being Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor. Mastriano has said that LGBTQ couples should not be allowed to adopt children, gay marriage should not be legal and transgender females should not be permitted to compete in women’s sports.\n Other candidates in battleground races have also spoken out against LGBTQ issues.

Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against the rules. Biden has condemned these moves made by Republican Texas Gov.

The shocking move will worsen global inflation, undermine successful efforts in the U.S. to bring down the price of gas, and help fuel Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>The Saudi decision was a pointed blow to the U.S., but the U.S. also has a way to respond: It can promptly pause the massive transfer of American warfare technology into the eager hands of the Saudis. Simply put, America shouldn’t be providing such unlimited control of strategic defense systems to an apparent ally of our greatest enemy — nuclear bomb extortionist Vladmir Putin.</p> <p>That is why we are proposing bicameral legislation in the Senate and House on Tuesday that will immediately halt all U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. For several years now, our colleagues have been considering similar proposals, but those measures haven’t passed. Due to intense bipartisan blowback to Saudi’s collusion with Russia, we think this time is different. Based on our conversation with colleagues, our legislation is already garnering bipartisan support in both chambers.</p> <p>What would lead the Saudis so unwisely to err with their recent OPEC+ mistake? Stunned energy commentators have suggested that the Saudis were merely concerned about their endangered financial returns, acting rationally.

The shocking move will worsen global inflation, undermine successful efforts in the U.S. to bring down the price of gas, and help fuel Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n The Saudi decision was a pointed blow to the U.S., but the U.S. also has a way to respond: It can promptly pause the massive transfer of American warfare technology into the eager hands of the Saudis. Simply put, America shouldn’t be providing such unlimited control of strategic defense systems to an apparent ally of our greatest enemy — nuclear bomb extortionist Vladmir Putin.\n That is why we are proposing bicameral legislation in the Senate and House on Tuesday that will immediately halt all U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. For several years now, our colleagues have been considering similar proposals, but those measures haven’t passed. Due to intense bipartisan blowback to Saudi’s collusion with Russia, we think this time is different. Based on our conversation with colleagues, our legislation is already garnering bipartisan support in both chambers.\n What would lead the Saudis so unwisely to err with their recent OPEC+ mistake? Stunned energy commentators have suggested that the Saudis were merely concerned about their endangered financial returns, acting rationally. Denying any political motives, Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst, New York Times\",\"_id\":\"00000183-bece-da37-a1b3-bffeafa50000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">insisted in the New York Times that the move was merely “to keep the price in an acceptable band.”\n But this claim is unjustified. OPEC has never cut production in such a record tight market and these production cuts will lead to unsustainably low oil inventories, sending the price of oil skyrocketing out of any “acceptable band.” Furthermore, the G-7 oil price caps plan is not targeted at OPEC; it is strictly limited to Russian oil.\n Nor can this Saudi move be justified by the non-existent global recession its leaders cite. Presently markets are very tight, with lush 73 percent profit margins for Saudi Arabia. In other words, there was no immediate need for Saudi Arabia to reduce supply unless they were seeking to harm the U.S. to the benefit of Russia.\n Every OPEC member has been making massive profits recently — except Russia because it is OPEC’s least efficient producer. It costs Russia $46/barrel to extract oil but, with U.S. technology, the Saudi’s cost is only $22/barrel. Plus, only Russia has had to offer huge $35/barrel discounts to customers like India and China since few others want sanctioned Russian oil.\n To be clear, Saudi Arabia remains important to energy security and stability in the Middle East, to global economic prosperity, and as a regional ally against Iran, but it made a terrible mistake this week. The country’s support for Russia should spark a far-reaching review of the U.S.-Saudi relationship — even as the regime tries to “sportswash” its international image in the wake of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder and the humanitarian disaster caused by Saudi’s war in Yemen.\n Members of Congress are already talking about how best to respond. Some propose extending domestic antitrust laws to international commerce. Others propose reviving a GOP initiative to withdraw U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia. But that idea has failed previously given that the U.S. would rather have its own troops there than Russian or Chinese troops.\n A simpler, far more urgent move to fortify U.S. national security would be to pause all U.S. military supplies, sales and other weapons aid to Saudi Arabia. This includes the controversial, new and hastily planned Red Sands testing facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n U.S. military collaboration with the Saudi regime is more extensive than many realize, but that also gives the U.S. significant economic and security leverage over Riyadh. Today, Saudi Arabia is hugely dependent on U.S. defense assistance, purchasing the vast majority of its arms from the United States. The country cannot substitute defense suppliers unless it wishes to partner with Russia, Iran or China for far inferior systems which have no interoperability with their existing weaponry. (While Saudi does source some military technology from other countries, that’s typically low-grade weaponry and small arms such as legacy grenade launchers, rifles and ammunition.)\n Perhaps even more important than Saudi’s reliance on U.S. arms is its reliance on U.S. companies to help build up the local defense industry through big-ticket joint ventures. These sensitive and intensive arrangements — which have received little public attention — were largely initiated in 2017 and have outsourced U.S. sensitive technology and U.S. jobs to Saudi Arabia without any U.S. control. The U.S. doesn’t have arrangements of this magnitude with any other allies.\n Given the early-stage nature of these joint ventures as well as minimal interoperability between Saudi’s current weapons system and potential foreign replacements, Saudi can do little to respond to this proposed legislation other than come back to the table and negotiate with the U.S. in good faith.

San Diego published a widely praised book, <i>How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them.</i></p> <p>There’s no doubt that our politics is in a perpetual febrile state; that a former president of the United States denies to this day the legitimacy of his defeat in the 2020 election and has made that contention a central pillar of his still potent political movement; and that faith in our institutions is at a low ebb.</p> <p>It is entirely possible that we will experience more political violence, and that would be a tragedy.

The two men will debate for the second time on Thursday.\n  Sam Stein contributed reporting","dc:creator":"Christopher Cadelago and Holly Otterbein","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/e8/52/0512e7584c628e8aef83263453e4/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1413502551"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Scott Olson/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Lt.

The 44-year-old from Moscow had a good job in telecommunications and was able to take frequent vacations in Europe. He was more focused on his family and career than keeping up with the news and machinations in the Kremlin. But in 2015, everything changed when Boris Nemtsov, a popular opposition leader, was assassinated.</p> <p>“There was no doubt in my mind that Putin or his inner circle ordered the killing,” Roman says. “I had rational issues with Putin and the government after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, but this murder made everything emotional. I became fully politically involved — I followed the news, went to protests and blogged.”</p> <p>Roman became disillusioned with Putin and his regime, and now finds himself at odds with the majority of Russians who support his war in Ukraine. On Sept. 21, when Putin declared a “partial” military mobilization that would draft at least 300,000 additional soldiers, men like Roman faced a life-or-death choice: If they received draft notices but refused to go, they would risk a 10-year prison sentence for draft evasion; if they couldn’t avoid the draft, they would risk death in a war they didn’t believe in. The only other alternative was to try to flee the country.</p> <p>POLITICO spoke with seven Russian men, including Roman, who oppose the war and have had to choose among those three options.

I knew this was the end of Russia. I worried for my three kids, for their future. I thought about emigration a lot, but I kept putting it off — kids had school, I had a job. These were all excuses.</p> <p>On Sept. 21 when Putin announced “partial” mobilization, I went to a protest for the first time in a couple of years. With this new possibility of a draft — I’m a reserve officer so I was a prime candidate for it — I considered my options: die in Putin’s war refusing to fight or die in prison. I don't want to kill anyone for no reason, especially not for Putin.</p> <p>No one I know asked, “How can we rebel?” Everyone is demoralized. And I don’t think you can resist — there is no way to successfully protest in Russia. I told everyone they should leave but I was paralyzed by shock.</p> <p>On Sept. 27, I received a call from a friend. There were rumors that Russia might close the borders the next day, so my friend asked me straightforwardly: “Would you leave? Yes or no. You have 10 minutes to decide, here is a plane ticket to Armenia if you say yes.”</p> <p>“Yes,” I said. Making this decision was like ripping off a bandage. Right away, I went home and hugged my kids goodbye. It was really hard — I never had to tell them goodbye in this way before. I packed my running clothing and a laptop. The airport was packed that day, mostly with men of draft age, many carrying only backpacks. I was traveling with a group of successful professional grown men who cried like little girls because they are forced to leave their families. We passed border control without any issues. </p> <p>The next day, in Yerevan, I finally felt free. For the first time in a long time, I could think past tomorrow. I started to imagine a future for my family anywhere else but Russia. I told my wife to sell everything she can, take the kids and join me. I don’t care if this life might mean financial struggles — I would take any job, I just want my kids to grow up free.</p> <p><br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/8f/64/d112f43649b5b24d195cc4f28247/2-russiadepart-mikhail.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Mikhail</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">(Pseudonym)</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 39</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Yakutsk,</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">the Sakha Republic, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">W</span>hen the mobilization started, I planned to flee. I bought a plane ticket, but I wasn’t courageous enough to choose a life of poverty and uncertainty as a refugee, so I stayed. If the military recruiters came for me, I would rather go to prison or willingly die on the battlefield than take another person’s life.</p> <p>Like many, I was in shock when the war in Ukraine started on Feb. 24. To me and many other Yakuts, who are a Turkic ethnic group and identify as Asian, it was inconceivable that one Slavic group, Russians, could attack another Slavic group — Ukrainians. </p> <p>My opinion about this war and mobilization is shaped a lot by my region and its culture. The Sakha Republic is quite unique; it’s a remote region along the Arctic Ocean in the Russian Far East. Yakuts are the majority, and we have a separate history, language and culture. We have been often treated like a colony — during the Soviet times, our region was commonly perceived as land used for its resources rather than a place to live. Our ethnic identity was suppressed too in the Soviet attempt to make everyone “Russian.” When my parents were young, they were forbidden to speak the Yakut language in public spaces.</p> <p>I became interested in politics around 2012 when Vladimir Putin was reelected for a third term despite widespread allegations of fraud. In the following years, I watched how the political situation in the country has been getting worse.</p> <p>At first, when Putin’s partial mobilization announcement on Wednesday, Sept. 21 came out, I didn’t think it would affect me. I have high blood pressure, which excused me from the mandatory military service after college, so, considering that Putin said they wanted only men with military experience, I assumed that it was safe. In the following two days, many men in Yakutsk without any military experience received draft notes. They went to the recruitment office to clarify what they thought was a misunderstanding — they were taken to the war.</p> <p>Many men I knew had fled the country. Some of my colleagues fled with just a backpack and let their management know after the fact. I decided to leave the country as well. Air travel is practically the only way out of Yakutsk, so the following Saturday I bought a plane ticket to Novosibirsk for next Wednesday.</p> <p>I agonized over my decision all weekend and on Monday, I canceled the flight. I don’t have much money and I realized that if I fled, I would choose a life of struggle and poverty. I admire the people who left but I couldn’t muster the courage myself. I decided to stay and help those who fled by mailing them things they left behind — documents, warm clothing, etc. Someone has to do this.</p> <p>If I get drafted, my plan is to tell the recruiters that I’m unreliable. I believe Russia is an aggressor and I support Ukraine, I won’t fight — this makes me a terrible recruit. I might be sent to prison for this — it’s illegal in Russia to speak badly of the army, and a new law makes avoiding the draft a prison-punishing offense. I would rather go to prison than go to the war.</p> <p>If they still send me to the war, I will be like James McAvoy’s character in<i> Atonement: </i>I’ll wander meaninglessly on the battlefield until someone or something kills me. I can’t shoot anyone. I never took to hunting, a nearly religious practice for Yakuts. I know some Yakuts who say that want to go to the war “to take a break from work and family,” they don’t see Ukrainians as people and don’t mind killing them. Personally, I would rather die than kill anyone.</p> <p>Recently, a lot of women came together to protest mobilization in Yakutsk. It was purposefully organized and attended by women because this is the only way to keep it peaceful — the police tend to beat up and arrest men. Still, in the end, some women were arrested, even older women. It’s an unacceptable way to treat women in our culture and was hard to watch. You can overthrow the government only in a democracy. Russia, unfortunately, is an authoritarian regime and all the institutions like police and courts serve just one person – Vladimir Putin. You can’t storm the Kremlin – there are too many police on their side. I feel like I live in <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>.</p> <p> </p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e2/0e/d38c045a4c23a8ff3097c7cd444e/3-russiadepart-sergei.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Sergei</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 44</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Saint Petersburg, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span> left Russia because I lost all hope.</p> <p>They say, if you can’t tolerate the messy present, study the Middle Ages. That’s what I did — I restored old books and focused on the past. For the longest time, my family avoided politics. I hadn't followed the news, but when I heard that Russia annexed Crimea [in 2014], I thought it was a good thing — I had an imperialist mindset and liked the idea that Russia was strong, and it was getting some of the old territories back. I wish I’d woken up to the reality sooner.</p> <p>The mandatory vaccination against Covid-19 was the push I needed that shook me awake and got me interested in politics. At some point in the pandemic, I refused to get vaccinated per the requirement for state employees — I worked at a state museum then. Management banned me from showing up to work and stopped paying me, so I quit.

Being tracked like that, not being able to enter a grocery store without a QR code, made me feel like a misfit.</p> <p>After the war started in February, things started to get worse. My wife and I sent our elder son to Tbilisi, Georgia, and planned to join him later. But I got a dream job — restoration of old books at the National Library of Russia. As the months flew by, Russia was turning into a fascist state. There is a pro-war letter “Z” everywhere and there are many fascists who say, “We should kill Ukrainians.” Propaganda works well, especially on the older generation. I haven’t talked to my mother in months because of it.</p> <p>In August, my wife, our two other kids and I went to Tbilisi again. They stayed there, but I decided to return to Russia. A week later, mobilization started, and I realized I had to leave for good — I’m a reserve officer, young and in good health. Going to the war and fighting against Ukrainians was not an option. I didn’t want to go to prison either.</p> <p>I had heard that there was a long line at the checkpoint I usually travel through to get to Georgia, so I traveled to Vishnevka, a checkpoint in the Volgograd Oblast bordering Kazakhstan. I’ve heard the line there was shorter. I got there on Sept. 25, and it was long. I wasn’t prepared. I didn’t bring winter clothing with me and the night in the line was freezing. The next day I realized that the line wasn’t moving at all and I overheard the border control had unofficial orders to slow people down. By then, we’d heard the rumors that the borders might close officially on the 28<sup>th</sup>, and if I’d stayed in that line, I would not have made it out.</p> <p>My wife bought me a plane ticket to Belarus instead, and I turned around and headed to a nearby airport. I stayed two days in Minsk until I managed to buy a ticket to Georgia and reunited with my family on Sept. 30th.</p> <p>It’s great to be finally free — I probably will have to work as a plumber or electrician, but I’m grateful to be out of Russia. Some of the Georgians do call us racist slurs and they might kick Russian emigrants out. We deserve it, but I hope it won’t come to that.</p> <p>On Oct. 5, days after I left Russia, a former colleague of mine reached out to say a draft notice in my name arrived at the State Hermitage Museum where I used to work until February. I didn’t think the recruiters would come that close to finding me.

The Russian military is notorious for its hazing; racist attitudes toward Dagestanis and other “Black” people only make this terrible tradition even harder for them.</p> <p>Before the army, I never was called any of the racial slurs that are so common outside of the Caucasus. The city is very diverse; there are more than 36 different ethnic groups, and because of it, racial tension is uncommon. I’m Avar, which is technically Caucasian, but in Russia people like me from the Caucasus are often considered Black.</p> <p>It was particularly bad in the military base where I served because people there weren’t used to dealing with Dagestani men. As they hazed new recruits, Russians bent to their will, their norms. Dagestani men didn’t, so there were a lot of fights. I fought, too, and for one fight with an officer I was sent to the penal battalion for half a year. Soon after I got out, another Russian picked a fight with me and I ended up going to prison for three years for it. Many Dagestani serving in the military end up in prison this way.</p> <p>In 2000, I committed a “sin” — I voted for Putin during his first run for president. But just a few years later, in prison, I had a political awakening. I read newspapers, became interested in politics and realized how corrupt Putin and his close circle were. From the news stories, I saw that Putin was eliminating any political opposition, not a sign of a good leader. </p> <p>Soon after my release, I moved to St. Petersburg and for a couple of years was involved in local politics and went to protests — against Putin, the local government and anything else I found important. Over time less and less independent media became available. I lost belief in the Russian opposition. I realized what this government was long before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russians split into two groups who believed that Crimea was either Ukrainian or Russian. I think they are both wrong: Crimea belongs to the Crimean Tatars, its indigenous group. They should be the ones deciding Crimea’s fate. </p> <p>When it comes to mobilization, I should be exempt because I have four kids. But Russia has lost thousands of soldiers in this war and it desperately needs to plug this hole and recruit as much cannon fodder as possible. And I don’t trust the recruitment office; they trick people, they give you documents to sign and suddenly you are a contractor on the way to Ukraine. This is what’s happening back in Dagestan — they round up Dagestanis who are not supposed to be mobilized and try to get them to sign contracts. I think it’s disproportionally targeting Dagestan men and it’s just a new way to suppress the Caucasus region. Dagestan, however, fights back against the mobilization — there have been heated protests. Many Dagestani men have fled, and who can blame them? Islam doesn’t permit unlawful murders or participations in unjust wars. Of course, there are Dagestanis who align themselves with the government and support Putin, especially in the villages. They sold out.</p> <p>Maybe white Russians could do something about Putin. Maybe they could protest. I’m Black, I can’t go out and protest on their behalf. If I protest and get arrested, I can get charged with extremism. I hear people who have fled Russia speak eloquently about Putin and how all of this is his fault. But even if Russians overthrow Putin and install someone new like Alexei Navalny, it would be just a new führer — Russians are too focused on preserving what they perceive as Russianness, and that is whiteness.</p> <p><br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/61/08/36df0bfd45b8ad291458ba7ab0b8/5-russiadepart-konstantin.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Konstantin Konkov</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 22</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Moscow</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">O</span>n Sept. 27, a recruiter and police officers stopped me outside of the government building where I work and tried to illegally give me a draft notice. I managed to stand my ground and be left alone.</p> <p>There are numerous reports of unlawful mobilization: Recruiters are not filling out draft notices correctly, recruiters are delivering notices to people who are supposed to be excluded from mobilization and people are being drafted even if they are not in the reserves. I’m a student, and my supporters and I tried to explain it to a recruiter outside of the Council of Deputies building where I work as a Mozhaysky District representative. The fact that I’m still a student is supposed to make me exempt from the mobilization despite my past military service, but it was tricky at the time — I’m not studying at the same university where I started after high school, which could have potentially negated my right to be excused because of my studies.</p> <p>Luckily, I and people who came out to support me didn’t get confused when a recruiter approached me; we demanded to see the documents that enabled him to give me a draft notice. It turned out he didn’t have a right to do so. Once he and his allies understood, they left.

It was around 2012 and I was in middle school when I saw a flyer in my apartment building. It mentioned how the daughter of a government official received a token punishment for committing double murder and contrasted that against the long sentence meted out to a woman for throwing an empty plastic bottle at a cop during a protest. It struck me as unjust that this regular woman, a mother, could be sentenced to years in prison. I made copies of the flyer and hung them in my school. It was invigorating to see my schoolmates stop by and read it. A few years later, I became an activist — I have participated in protests and have been arrested a couple of times for it.</p> <p>After dropping out of college after my freshman year I went to the army. It was a challenging experience — soldiers of different ethnicities had tense relationships with one another and there were many fights. I came back in 2019. Since then I have worked on several political campaigns, volunteered for different causes and worked for non-profits. In 2020, I enrolled at the Russian State Agricultural University to study biology, and last month I won municipal elections as an independent candidate and became the Mozhaysky District Representative. I have this job now while I continue with my studies. Perhaps the delivery of the summons was connected to the desire of the pro-Putin representatives to get rid of me.</p> <p><br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9e/0f/64e5ee3441f0ae8195f2cfec8374/6-russiadepart-pavel.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Pavel</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 39</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Tolyatti, Samara Oblast, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">M</span>obilization didn’t come as a surprise — I knew our “Tsar” Vladimir Putin has been losing this meaningless war and it was just a matter of time until he needed more cannon fodder. I left Russia because I have no intention of dying in this war — or in prison for protesting the draft.</p> <p>When Putin announced mobilization, I thought I was relatively safe. I’m not in the reserves, meaning that I shouldn’t be drafted first. But I’m under no illusion that my lack of military experience would be disregarded. Even if I’m safe in this round of mobilization, I wouldn’t be in the next. I didn’t want to wait around to see what comes next — I have a family, kids, and no desire to die in this meaningless way.</p> <p>On Sept. 30, my wife called me at work in panic — Putin was scheduled to speak later that day, and she feared that he was going to announce another wave of mobilization or officially declare war with Ukraine. The war has been labeled a “special operation” thus far, which limits the reach of mobilization; however, once it becomes an official war, they can draft anyone.</p> <p>We decided I had to leave Russia as soon as possible. I left work, packed a small suitcase and took a taxi to a checkpoint in Mashtakov township on the border with Kazakhstan, about a 4-hour drive from Tolyatti. The line of cars to the border stretched 21 miles. Out of fear of retaliation from people in the line, the taxi driver wouldn’t take me closer to the border and would not take me to where the line started for people crossing on foot. I searched online and found a man with a Jeep who agreed to take me and a few other people closer to the checkpoint by going off-road. He made a lot of money on that 40-minute trip — many people are profiting off the fears of Russian men.</p> <p>He dropped me and others off a few miles from the border and we walked two hours with our luggage, getting to the line by 4:30 am. That line was about 50 people, and I crossed in an hour. From the conversations I had with other people in the line, I felt a sense of doom about Russia’s future. These were educated and intelligent people — engineers, programmers, students. All of them could have contributed to the growth of the Russian economy, but now each person would be working to make some other country better. Putin is doing that to Russia — he is meaninglessly killing one group of men in war and forcing the other to flee. And who is left?</p> <p>Kazakhs’ kindness almost brings me to tears. A few days after I crossed, I met a Kazakh man who offered me a room and board in his house in a village outside of Astana. I can stay for free as long as I help his elderly parents in his absence — ironically, he headed to Ukraine to fight on the side of Russia to make money.</p> <p>From here, I’m planning to go to South Korea or Turkey for temporary work to make some money. There is no other way to earn enough in Kazakhstan to pay for my family’s relocation from Russia and life abroad.</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/04/fe5b7bf44083b07532fe4ec5adc5/section-breaks-ukraine.png\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/f4/f6/729c8f64447bb6bac2db3fe0a3df/7-russiadepart-roman.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Roman</h3> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Age: 23</h4> <h4 style=\"text-align: center\">From: Saint Petersburg, Russia</h4> <p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span> can’t even think of what would happen if I got drafted — the possibility of it is too scary.</p> <p>I moved to St. Petersburg from Volgograd after college two years ago. It’s a bigger city and there are more opportunities here. Through my work as a bartender, I met a lot of interesting, socially and politically active people whose interest in politics started to rub off on me. However, it was the war in Ukraine that became a turning point for me, after which I became truly invested in politics and news.</p> <p>Many people I know upended their lives and left the country within a day of Putin announcing mobilization. One of the “sister bars” to the places where I work lost three out of four bartenders to emigration in about a week. Our management is understanding of the situation: to avoid military recruiters harassing us at our workplace, they fired us on paper. We continued working unofficially, feeling a bit more protected by the fact the recruiters wouldn’t come looking for us here.</p> <p>I’m not too worried for myself at the moment — I’m in category C for mobilization, meaning that I can be drafted, but I have health issues that should be taken into consideration. I shouldn’t be taken to combat but kept in administrative work and such.

The 44-year-old from Moscow had a good job in telecommunications and was able to take frequent vacations in Europe. He was more focused on his family and career than keeping up with the news and machinations in the Kremlin. But in 2015, everything changed when Boris Nemtsov, a popular opposition leader, was assassinated.\n “There was no doubt in my mind that Putin or his inner circle ordered the killing,” Roman says. “I had rational issues with Putin and the government after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, but this murder made everything emotional. I became fully politically involved — I followed the news, went to protests and blogged.”\n Roman became disillusioned with Putin and his regime, and now finds himself at odds with the majority of Russians who support his war in Ukraine. On Sept. 21, when Putin declared a “partial” military mobilization that would draft at least 300,000 additional soldiers, men like Roman faced a life-or-death choice: If they received draft notices but refused to go, they would risk a 10-year prison sentence for draft evasion; if they couldn’t avoid the draft, they would risk death in a war they didn’t believe in. The only other alternative was to try to flee the country.\n POLITICO spoke with seven Russian men, including Roman, who oppose the war and have had to choose among those three options. Some of them, like Roman, have left the country — and their families — behind. Others are hunkering down, avoiding strangers and planning escape routes from their workplaces, hoping a draft notice won’t land in their hands. They’ve heard the widespread reports of forced conscriptions, including of men who are older than the age limit for mobilization (up to 50 for soldiers and 65 for high-ranking officers) and those who have health issues or no military experience. There are also reports of minority ethnic groups such as Crimean Tatars, Dagestanis and Siberian indigenous groups being disproportionately conscripted.\n \n The perspectives of these seven men offer a glimpse into the toll Putin’s war is having on ordinary Russians, particularly those who disagree with the Kremlin’s line.\n “These people are not fleeing the war, they are not afraid of death,” Roman says. “They are fleeing this [hopeless] situation.”\n These interviews were conducted in Russian through texts and calls on Telegram and Messenger. Most of the men chose to keep some form of anonymity, fearing that they could face backlash from the government and be imprisoned for their words.\n The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n   \n   \n Roman P.\n Age: 44\n From: Moscow\n The start of the war in Ukraine on Feb. 24 was devastating. I knew this was the end of Russia. I worried for my three kids, for their future. I thought about emigration a lot, but I kept putting it off — kids had school, I had a job. These were all excuses.\n On Sept. 21 when Putin announced “partial” mobilization, I went to a protest for the first time in a couple of years. With this new possibility of a draft — I’m a reserve officer so I was a prime candidate for it — I considered my options: die in Putin’s war refusing to fight or die in prison. I don't want to kill anyone for no reason, especially not for Putin.\n No one I know asked, “How can we rebel?” Everyone is demoralized. And I don’t think you can resist — there is no way to successfully protest in Russia. I told everyone they should leave but I was paralyzed by shock.\n On Sept. 27, I received a call from a friend. There were rumors that Russia might close the borders the next day, so my friend asked me straightforwardly: “Would you leave? Yes or no. You have 10 minutes to decide, here is a plane ticket to Armenia if you say yes.”\n “Yes,” I said. Making this decision was like ripping off a bandage. Right away, I went home and hugged my kids goodbye. It was really hard — I never had to tell them goodbye in this way before. I packed my running clothing and a laptop. The airport was packed that day, mostly with men of draft age, many carrying only backpacks. I was traveling with a group of successful professional grown men who cried like little girls because they are forced to leave their families. We passed border control without any issues. \n The next day, in Yerevan, I finally felt free. For the first time in a long time, I could think past tomorrow. I started to imagine a future for my family anywhere else but Russia. I told my wife to sell everything she can, take the kids and join me. I don’t care if this life might mean financial struggles — I would take any job, I just want my kids to grow up free.\n \n \n  \n   \n Mikhail\n (Pseudonym)\n Age: 39\n From: Yakutsk,\n the Sakha Republic, Russia\n When the mobilization started, I planned to flee. I bought a plane ticket, but I wasn’t courageous enough to choose a life of poverty and uncertainty as a refugee, so I stayed. If the military recruiters came for me, I would rather go to prison or willingly die on the battlefield than take another person’s life.\n Like many, I was in shock when the war in Ukraine started on Feb. 24. To me and many other Yakuts, who are a Turkic ethnic group and identify as Asian, it was inconceivable that one Slavic group, Russians, could attack another Slavic group — Ukrainians. \n My opinion about this war and mobilization is shaped a lot by my region and its culture. The Sakha Republic is quite unique; it’s a remote region along the Arctic Ocean in the Russian Far East. Yakuts are the majority, and we have a separate history, language and culture. We have been often treated like a colony — during the Soviet times, our region was commonly perceived as land used for its resources rather than a place to live. Our ethnic identity was suppressed too in the Soviet attempt to make everyone “Russian.” When my parents were young, they were forbidden to speak the Yakut language in public spaces.\n I became interested in politics around 2012 when Vladimir Putin was reelected for a third term despite widespread allegations of fraud. In the following years, I watched how the political situation in the country has been getting worse.\n At first, when Putin’s partial mobilization announcement on Wednesday, Sept. 21 came out, I didn’t think it would affect me. I have high blood pressure, which excused me from the mandatory military service after college, so, considering that Putin said they wanted only men with military experience, I assumed that it was safe. In the following two days, many men in Yakutsk without any military experience received draft notes. They went to the recruitment office to clarify what they thought was a misunderstanding — they were taken to the war.\n Many men I knew had fled the country. Some of my colleagues fled with just a backpack and let their management know after the fact. I decided to leave the country as well. Air travel is practically the only way out of Yakutsk, so the following Saturday I bought a plane ticket to Novosibirsk for next Wednesday.\n I agonized over my decision all weekend and on Monday, I canceled the flight. I don’t have much money and I realized that if I fled, I would choose a life of struggle and poverty. I admire the people who left but I couldn’t muster the courage myself. I decided to stay and help those who fled by mailing them things they left behind — documents, warm clothing, etc. Someone has to do this.\n If I get drafted, my plan is to tell the recruiters that I’m unreliable. I believe Russia is an aggressor and I support Ukraine, I won’t fight — this makes me a terrible recruit. I might be sent to prison for this — it’s illegal in Russia to speak badly of the army, and a new law makes avoiding the draft a prison-punishing offense. I would rather go to prison than go to the war.\n If they still send me to the war, I will be like James McAvoy’s character in Atonement: I’ll wander meaninglessly on the battlefield until someone or something kills me. I can’t shoot anyone. I never took to hunting, a nearly religious practice for Yakuts. I know some Yakuts who say that want to go to the war “to take a break from work and family,” they don’t see Ukrainians as people and don’t mind killing them. Personally, I would rather die than kill anyone.\n Recently, a lot of women came together to protest mobilization in Yakutsk. It was purposefully organized and attended by women because this is the only way to keep it peaceful — the police tend to beat up and arrest men. Still, in the end, some women were arrested, even older women. It’s an unacceptable way to treat women in our culture and was hard to watch. You can overthrow the government only in a democracy. Russia, unfortunately, is an authoritarian regime and all the institutions like police and courts serve just one person – Vladimir Putin. You can’t storm the Kremlin – there are too many police on their side. I feel like I live in The Handmaid’s Tale.\n  \n   \n   \n Sergei\n Age: 44\n From: Saint Petersburg, Russia\n I left Russia because I lost all hope.\n They say, if you can’t tolerate the messy present, study the Middle Ages. That’s what I did — I restored old books and focused on the past. For the longest time, my family avoided politics. I hadn't followed the news, but when I heard that Russia annexed Crimea [in 2014], I thought it was a good thing — I had an imperialist mindset and liked the idea that Russia was strong, and it was getting some of the old territories back. I wish I’d woken up to the reality sooner.\n The mandatory vaccination against Covid-19 was the push I needed that shook me awake and got me interested in politics. At some point in the pandemic, I refused to get vaccinated per the requirement for state employees — I worked at a state museum then. Management banned me from showing up to work and stopped paying me, so I quit. Around the same time, St. Petersburg was requiring people to scan QR codes before entering public spaces to prove that they were vaccinated against Covid-19 or tested negative. Being tracked like that, not being able to enter a grocery store without a QR code, made me feel like a misfit.\n After the war started in February, things started to get worse. My wife and I sent our elder son to Tbilisi, Georgia, and planned to join him later. But I got a dream job — restoration of old books at the National Library of Russia. As the months flew by, Russia was turning into a fascist state. There is a pro-war letter “Z” everywhere and there are many fascists who say, “We should kill Ukrainians.” Propaganda works well, especially on the older generation. I haven’t talked to my mother in months because of it.\n In August, my wife, our two other kids and I went to Tbilisi again. They stayed there, but I decided to return to Russia. A week later, mobilization started, and I realized I had to leave for good — I’m a reserve officer, young and in good health. Going to the war and fighting against Ukrainians was not an option. I didn’t want to go to prison either.\n I had heard that there was a long line at the checkpoint I usually travel through to get to Georgia, so I traveled to Vishnevka, a checkpoint in the Volgograd Oblast bordering Kazakhstan. I’ve heard the line there was shorter. I got there on Sept. 25, and it was long. I wasn’t prepared. I didn’t bring winter clothing with me and the night in the line was freezing. The next day I realized that the line wasn’t moving at all and I overheard the border control had unofficial orders to slow people down. By then, we’d heard the rumors that the borders might close officially on the 28th, and if I’d stayed in that line, I would not have made it out.\n My wife bought me a plane ticket to Belarus instead, and I turned around and headed to a nearby airport. I stayed two days in Minsk until I managed to buy a ticket to Georgia and reunited with my family on Sept. 30th.\n It’s great to be finally free — I probably will have to work as a plumber or electrician, but I’m grateful to be out of Russia. Some of the Georgians do call us racist slurs and they might kick Russian emigrants out. We deserve it, but I hope it won’t come to that.\n On Oct. 5, days after I left Russia, a former colleague of mine reached out to say a draft notice in my name arrived at the State Hermitage Museum where I used to work until February. I didn’t think the recruiters would come that close to finding me. There is nothing to go back for.\n \n  \n   \n Umaraskhab M.\n Age: 43\n From: Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan, Russia\n Russian problems go much deeper than Vladimir Putin. I think he represents the desire of so many white Russians to uplift Russia. However, the way they often envision it means continuous suppression of my people and other ethnic groups. \n I’m a Muslim and I was born and raised in Makhachkala, the capital of the Republic of Dagestan. This beautiful region in the North Caucasus has its own culture and a long history of resistance to Russia over the centuries. \n I left Dagestan in 2000 for the army after dropping out of college. My younger brother was drafted for mandatory military service and I decided to sign up as well, so he wouldn’t go alone. The Russian military is notorious for its hazing; racist attitudes toward Dagestanis and other “Black” people only make this terrible tradition even harder for them.\n Before the army, I never was called any of the racial slurs that are so common outside of the Caucasus. The city is very diverse; there are more than 36 different ethnic groups, and because of it, racial tension is uncommon. I’m Avar, which is technically Caucasian, but in Russia people like me from the Caucasus are often considered Black.\n It was particularly bad in the military base where I served because people there weren’t used to dealing with Dagestani men. As they hazed new recruits, Russians bent to their will, their norms. Dagestani men didn’t, so there were a lot of fights. I fought, too, and for one fight with an officer I was sent to the penal battalion for half a year. Soon after I got out, another Russian picked a fight with me and I ended up going to prison for three years for it. Many Dagestani serving in the military end up in prison this way.\n In 2000, I committed a “sin” — I voted for Putin during his first run for president. But just a few years later, in prison, I had a political awakening. I read newspapers, became interested in politics and realized how corrupt Putin and his close circle were. From the news stories, I saw that Putin was eliminating any political opposition, not a sign of a good leader. \n Soon after my release, I moved to St. Petersburg and for a couple of years was involved in local politics and went to protests — against Putin, the local government and anything else I found important. Over time less and less independent media became available. I lost belief in the Russian opposition. I realized what this government was long before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russians split into two groups who believed that Crimea was either Ukrainian or Russian. I think they are both wrong: Crimea belongs to the Crimean Tatars, its indigenous group. They should be the ones deciding Crimea’s fate. \n When it comes to mobilization, I should be exempt because I have four kids. But Russia has lost thousands of soldiers in this war and it desperately needs to plug this hole and recruit as much cannon fodder as possible. And I don’t trust the recruitment office; they trick people, they give you documents to sign and suddenly you are a contractor on the way to Ukraine. This is what’s happening back in Dagestan — they round up Dagestanis who are not supposed to be mobilized and try to get them to sign contracts. I think it’s disproportionally targeting Dagestan men and it’s just a new way to suppress the Caucasus region. Dagestan, however, fights back against the mobilization — there have been heated protests. Many Dagestani men have fled, and who can blame them? Islam doesn’t permit unlawful murders or participations in unjust wars. Of course, there are Dagestanis who align themselves with the government and support Putin, especially in the villages. They sold out.\n Maybe white Russians could do something about Putin. Maybe they could protest. I’m Black, I can’t go out and protest on their behalf. If I protest and get arrested, I can get charged with extremism. I hear people who have fled Russia speak eloquently about Putin and how all of this is his fault. But even if Russians overthrow Putin and install someone new like Alexei Navalny, it would be just a new führer — Russians are too focused on preserving what they perceive as Russianness, and that is whiteness.\n \n \n  \n   \n Konstantin Konkov\n Age: 22\n From: Moscow\n On Sept. 27, a recruiter and police officers stopped me outside of the government building where I work and tried to illegally give me a draft notice. I managed to stand my ground and be left alone.\n There are numerous reports of unlawful mobilization: Recruiters are not filling out draft notices correctly, recruiters are delivering notices to people who are supposed to be excluded from mobilization and people are being drafted even if they are not in the reserves. I’m a student, and my supporters and I tried to explain it to a recruiter outside of the Council of Deputies building where I work as a Mozhaysky District representative. The fact that I’m still a student is supposed to make me exempt from the mobilization despite my past military service, but it was tricky at the time — I’m not studying at the same university where I started after high school, which could have potentially negated my right to be excused because of my studies.\n Luckily, I and people who came out to support me didn’t get confused when a recruiter approached me; we demanded to see the documents that enabled him to give me a draft notice. It turned out he didn’t have a right to do so. Once he and his allies understood, they left. One of the videos of the incident went viral and it was perceived as a proper way to handle unlawful draft attempts.\n I got my first taste of activism at an early age. It was around 2012 and I was in middle school when I saw a flyer in my apartment building. It mentioned how the daughter of a government official received a token punishment for committing double murder and contrasted that against the long sentence meted out to a woman for throwing an empty plastic bottle at a cop during a protest. It struck me as unjust that this regular woman, a mother, could be sentenced to years in prison. I made copies of the flyer and hung them in my school. It was invigorating to see my schoolmates stop by and read it. A few years later, I became an activist — I have participated in protests and have been arrested a couple of times for it.\n After dropping out of college after my freshman year I went to the army. It was a challenging experience — soldiers of different ethnicities had tense relationships with one another and there were many fights. I came back in 2019. Since then I have worked on several political campaigns, volunteered for different causes and worked for non-profits. In 2020, I enrolled at the Russian State Agricultural University to study biology, and last month I won municipal elections as an independent candidate and became the Mozhaysky District Representative. I have this job now while I continue with my studies. Perhaps the delivery of the summons was connected to the desire of the pro-Putin representatives to get rid of me.\n \n \n  \n   \n Pavel\n Age: 39\n From: Tolyatti, Samara Oblast, Russia\n Mobilization didn’t come as a surprise — I knew our “Tsar” Vladimir Putin has been losing this meaningless war and it was just a matter of time until he needed more cannon fodder. I left Russia because I have no intention of dying in this war — or in prison for protesting the draft.\n When Putin announced mobilization, I thought I was relatively safe. I’m not in the reserves, meaning that I shouldn’t be drafted first. But I’m under no illusion that my lack of military experience would be disregarded. Even if I’m safe in this round of mobilization, I wouldn’t be in the next. I didn’t want to wait around to see what comes next — I have a family, kids, and no desire to die in this meaningless way.\n On Sept. 30, my wife called me at work in panic — Putin was scheduled to speak later that day, and she feared that he was going to announce another wave of mobilization or officially declare war with Ukraine. The war has been labeled a “special operation” thus far, which limits the reach of mobilization; however, once it becomes an official war, they can draft anyone.\n We decided I had to leave Russia as soon as possible. I left work, packed a small suitcase and took a taxi to a checkpoint in Mashtakov township on the border with Kazakhstan, about a 4-hour drive from Tolyatti. The line of cars to the border stretched 21 miles. Out of fear of retaliation from people in the line, the taxi driver wouldn’t take me closer to the border and would not take me to where the line started for people crossing on foot. I searched online and found a man with a Jeep who agreed to take me and a few other people closer to the checkpoint by going off-road. He made a lot of money on that 40-minute trip — many people are profiting off the fears of Russian men.\n He dropped me and others off a few miles from the border and we walked two hours with our luggage, getting to the line by 4:30 am. That line was about 50 people, and I crossed in an hour. From the conversations I had with other people in the line, I felt a sense of doom about Russia’s future. These were educated and intelligent people — engineers, programmers, students. All of them could have contributed to the growth of the Russian economy, but now each person would be working to make some other country better. Putin is doing that to Russia — he is meaninglessly killing one group of men in war and forcing the other to flee. And who is left?\n Kazakhs’ kindness almost brings me to tears. A few days after I crossed, I met a Kazakh man who offered me a room and board in his house in a village outside of Astana. I can stay for free as long as I help his elderly parents in his absence — ironically, he headed to Ukraine to fight on the side of Russia to make money.\n From here, I’m planning to go to South Korea or Turkey for temporary work to make some money. There is no other way to earn enough in Kazakhstan to pay for my family’s relocation from Russia and life abroad.\n   \n   \n Roman\n Age: 23\n From: Saint Petersburg, Russia\n I can’t even think of what would happen if I got drafted — the possibility of it is too scary.\n I moved to St. Petersburg from Volgograd after college two years ago. It’s a bigger city and there are more opportunities here. Through my work as a bartender, I met a lot of interesting, socially and politically active people whose interest in politics started to rub off on me. However, it was the war in Ukraine that became a turning point for me, after which I became truly invested in politics and news.\n Many people I know upended their lives and left the country within a day of Putin announcing mobilization. One of the “sister bars” to the places where I work lost three out of four bartenders to emigration in about a week. Our management is understanding of the situation: to avoid military recruiters harassing us at our workplace, they fired us on paper. We continued working unofficially, feeling a bit more protected by the fact the recruiters wouldn’t come looking for us here.\n I’m not too worried for myself at the moment — I’m in category C for mobilization, meaning that I can be drafted, but I have health issues that should be taken into consideration. I shouldn’t be taken to combat but kept in administrative work and such. My health issues excused me from mandatory military service after college, but if the “military operation” were to become an official war, my health issues wouldn’t protect me from the draft.\n I try to be careful going about my day — there are patrol cars on the streets stopping every other car, and there are military recruiters checking military registration cards on the subway. If they get to me, I know how to protest it — I know where to appeal, what governor to write. There are stories of people being mobilized by mistake and being returned later. You just need to know where to complain.\n Many men who have fled the mobilization are the peaceful kind. They can’t fight in a war or fight the government in a radical way. There are people in Russia who are resisting — there are protests, and there are people setting the recruitment offices on fire. It’s just so much harder to overthrow the government in Russia than anywhere else.\n Now, I’m biding my time until I make enough money and renew my international passport to leave. I’m also waiting for my girlfriend to get her affairs in order before leaving.","dc:creator":"Anastasiia Carrier","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/83/23/d2fe41c14afbb3672aaa71acdf26/1-russiadepart-lede.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration by Jade Cuevas","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"The perspectives of these seven men offer a glimpse into the toll Putin’s war is having on ordinary Russians, particularly those who disagree with the Kremlin’s line.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/83/23/d2fe41c14afbb3672aaa71acdf26/1-russiadepart-lede.jpg"}}]},"content":"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine remains hugely popular in Russia, but his decision to draft 300,000 men has many fearing for their lives — and fleeing the country.","contentSnippet":"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine remains hugely popular in Russia, but his decision to draft 300,000 men has many fearing for their lives — and fleeing the country.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/14/russian-men-dodge-putin-draft-ukraine-00061579","isoDate":"2022-10-14T09:00:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Rachel Schnalzer","title":"Renting your home as a film location may pay off big time.

Yet college tuition is largely an exception. Applicants are asked questions about their family’s income and assets. Universities want to know if aspirants have siblings in college or extraordinary medical expenses. These prying questions are only asked of the non-rich, though the intent is altruistic: It is to determine how much aid to provide potential matriculants.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the wealthy are the only group in America that is not asked to pay what they can actually afford. An affluent family will only pay the tuition sticker price for their kids to attend college, even though doling out $60,000 might be an afterthought to them.</p> <p>This needs to stop.</p> <p>The only reform that can solve this disparity is for universities to stop advertising a pre-set, upper-bound on tuition. If a “no-limit tuition” approach was implemented, it could mean some families pay millions in tuition a year or more. Under this approach, the rich would be required to disclose their income and wealth, which universities would use to determine how much they could reasonably afford to pay in tuition. The result would lead to greater access and affordability for higher education along with new momentum in the push to shrink economic inequality.</p> <p>Elite colleges could use the added revenue generated by no-limit tuition to expand their class sizes dramatically, giving many more students the opportunity to study at their institution.

Yet college tuition is largely an exception. Applicants are asked questions about their family’s income and assets. Universities want to know if aspirants have siblings in college or extraordinary medical expenses. These prying questions are only asked of the non-rich, though the intent is altruistic: It is to determine how much aid to provide potential matriculants.\n Meanwhile, the wealthy are the only group in America that is not asked to pay what they can actually afford. An affluent family will only pay the tuition sticker price for their kids to attend college, even though doling out $60,000 might be an afterthought to them.\n This needs to stop.\n The only reform that can solve this disparity is for universities to stop advertising a pre-set, upper-bound on tuition. If a “no-limit tuition” approach was implemented, it could mean some families pay millions in tuition a year or more. Under this approach, the rich would be required to disclose their income and wealth, which universities would use to determine how much they could reasonably afford to pay in tuition. The result would lead to greater access and affordability for higher education along with new momentum in the push to shrink economic inequality.\n Elite colleges could use the added revenue generated by no-limit tuition to expand their class sizes dramatically, giving many more students the opportunity to study at their institution. Only a small portion of U.S. schools are both need blind — not taking into consideration an applicant’s ability to pay in admissions decisions — and offer full-need financial aid to students that don’t rely on loans (or significant borrowing). This select group’s ability to laudably provide as much aid as an admitted student needs depends on the schools not expanding access to an elite education by increasing their class size significantly. As the economist Danny Yagan suggests, “Free tuition only helps if you can get in.”\n At 38 elite U.S. colleges, more students attend from the top 1 percent (roughly 1.4 million households with an average annual income of $1.7 million) than from the bottom 60 percent. This indicates that a no-limit tuition model could create huge opportunities for the non-rich. Jeffrey Selingo notes that the three most prestigious Canadian universities — McGill University, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia — enroll roughly 150,000 undergraduate students combined. This is about as many undergraduates that collectively go to the 18 highest ranked U.S. universities.\n Non-elite universities could use the extra funding from no-limit tuition toward meeting the financial need of more undergraduates. Given that over 65 percent of students from families in the top 1 percent of income earners attend a non-elite school, the scope of potential extra financial aid to redistribute is considerable.\n To conservatives, such cross-subsidies might sound anathema, though economic theory suggests that price discrimination — charging everyone as much as they are willing to pay — maximizes profits, something conservatives champion. The only difference for universities engaging in price discrimination, as opposed to businesses, is that their non-profit status allows them to reduce educational inequalities instead of enriching shareholders.\n This suggestion is less radical than it sounds. In Finland, the price of a speeding ticket is determined as a percentage of one’s annual income to equally incentivize individuals to not speed. This has led to at least one individual being fined $103,000 for essentially going 45 mph in a 30 mph zone.\n Our society used to be less squeamish about asking everyone to contribute what they could.

Online videos and local media reported gunshots, as nationwide protests entered a fifth week.</p> <p>Iran’s state-run IRNA reported that there were clashes between prisoners in one ward and prison personnel, citing a senior security official. The official said prisoners had set fire to a warehouse full of prison uniforms, which caused the blaze. He said the “rioters” were separated from the other prisoners to de-escalate the conflict.</p> <p>The official said the “situation is completely under control” and that firemen were extinguishing the flames. But footage of the blaze continued to circulate online. Videos showed shots ringing out as plumes of smoke engulfed the sky in Tehran amid the sound of an alarm.</p> <p>The U.S.-based Center for Human Rights in Iran reported that an “armed conflict” broke out within the prison walls. It said shots were first heard in Ward 7 of the prison. This account could not immediately be verified.</p> <p>Demonstrators chanted “Down with the Dictator” on the streets of Ardabil in the country’s northwest. Outside of universities in Kermanshah, Rasht and Tehran, students rallied, according to videos on social media. In the city of Sanandaj, a hotspot for demonstrations in the northern Kurdish region, school girls chanted, “Woman, life, freedom,” down a central street.</p> <p>The protests erupted after public outrage over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. She was arrested by Iran’s morality police in Tehran for violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code. Iran’s government insists Amini was not mistreated in police custody, but her family says her body showed bruises and other signs of beating after she was detained.</p> <p>At least 233 protesters have been killed since demonstrations swept Iran on Sept. 17, according to U.S.-based rights monitor HRANA.

Online videos and local media reported gunshots, as nationwide protests entered a fifth week.\n Iran’s state-run IRNA reported that there were clashes between prisoners in one ward and prison personnel, citing a senior security official. The official said prisoners had set fire to a warehouse full of prison uniforms, which caused the blaze. He said the “rioters” were separated from the other prisoners to de-escalate the conflict.\n The official said the “situation is completely under control” and that firemen were extinguishing the flames. But footage of the blaze continued to circulate online. Videos showed shots ringing out as plumes of smoke engulfed the sky in Tehran amid the sound of an alarm.\n The U.S.-based Center for Human Rights in Iran reported that an “armed conflict” broke out within the prison walls. It said shots were first heard in Ward 7 of the prison. This account could not immediately be verified.\n Demonstrators chanted “Down with the Dictator” on the streets of Ardabil in the country’s northwest. Outside of universities in Kermanshah, Rasht and Tehran, students rallied, according to videos on social media. In the city of Sanandaj, a hotspot for demonstrations in the northern Kurdish region, school girls chanted, “Woman, life, freedom,” down a central street.\n The protests erupted after public outrage over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. She was arrested by Iran’s morality police in Tehran for violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code. Iran’s government insists Amini was not mistreated in police custody, but her family says her body showed bruises and other signs of beating after she was detained.\n At least 233 protesters have been killed since demonstrations swept Iran on Sept. 17, according to U.S.-based rights monitor HRANA. The group said 32 among the dead were below the age of 18. Earlier, Oslo-based Iran Human Rights estimated 201 people have been killed.\n Iranian authorities have dismissed the unrest as a purported Western plot, without providing evidence.\n Public anger in Iran has coalesced around Amini’s death, prompting girls and women to remove their mandatory headscarves on the street in a show of solidarity. Other segments of society, including oil workers, have also joined the movement, which has spread to at least 19 cities, becoming one of the greatest challenges to Iran’s theocracy since the country’s 2009 Green Movement.\n Riots have also broken out in prisons, with clashes reported between inmates and guards in Lakan prison in the northern province of Gilan recently.\n Commercial strikes resumed Saturday in key cities across the Kurdish region, including Saqqez, Amini’s hometown and the birthplace of the protests, Bukan and Sanandaj.\n The government has responded with a brutal crackdown, arresting activists and protest organizers, reprimanding Iranian celebrities for voicing support, even confiscating their passports, and using live ammunition, tear gas and sound bombs to disperse crowds, leading to deaths.\n In a video widely distributed Saturday, plainclothes Basij, a paramilitary volunteer group, are seen forcing a woman into a car and firing bullets into the air amid a protest in Gohardasht, in northern Iran.\n Widespread internet outages have also made it difficult for protesters to communicate with the outside world, while Iranian authorities have detained at least 40 journalists since the unrest began, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.","dc:creator":"Associated Press","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/e6/91/23d4b2a74d21a8647e56f64c2594/iran-repression-explainer-56316.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Protesters chant slogans during a protest over the death of a woman who was detained by the morality police, in downtown Tehran, Iran, on Sept. 21, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/e6/91/23d4b2a74d21a8647e56f64c2594/iran-repression-explainer-56316.jpg"}}]},"content":"Protests have swept the country after public outrage over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.","contentSnippet":"Protests have swept the country after public outrage over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/15/blaze-shots-prison-iran-protests-00061983","isoDate":"2022-10-15T20:35:25.000Z"},{"creator":"Irfan Khan","title":"Photos: Biden in town to tout infrastructure, makes stop at Tacos 1986","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-13/photos-biden-in-town-to-tout-infrastructure-makes-stop-at-tacos-1986","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 21:20:02 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>The president is in town. </p>","content:encodedSnippet":"The president is in town.","dc:creator":"Irfan Khan","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2958e60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1500x1000!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2Fdd%2F30f4e1bf4ea68952bc11e4e7be8f%2F1200397-me-1013-biden-nation-infrastructure-012-ik.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Los Angeles, CA - October 13: Construction crew listens to President Joe Biden address at the construction site for the future terminus of the Metro D (Purple) Line near the West Los Angeles VA Campus on Thursday, Oct. 13, 2022 in Los Angeles, CA.

The courthouse was a hive of supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, one of whom cursed Fanone in the courtroom, another of whom shouted at him about a conspiracy theory as he stepped away from the building.

He fully expects things to get nuttier still when the book officially launches on Oct. 11. But at least for a second, he appeared to appreciate the absurdity.</p> <p>Fanone pulled out his phone and took a selfie with the sign-bearing woman in the background, mugging for the camera.<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"“This is my reality,” said Michael Fanone.\n The bearded, tattooed ex-cop and I were walking to his pickup truck from federal court in D.C., where he’d just watched the sentencing of a member of the mob that beat him with a Blue Lives Matter flagpole, tased him repeatedly at the base of his skull, and nearly killed him on Jan. 6, 2021. The courthouse was a hive of supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, one of whom cursed Fanone in the courtroom, another of whom shouted at him about a conspiracy theory as he stepped away from the building. As we made our way down Pennsylvania Avenue, a man followed us, videotaping from his phone the entire time.\n Fanone, a ubiquitous TV presence since suffering a traumatic brain injury and a heart attack as a result of the assault, is accustomed to the snarling randos. They’ve shown up at his house and the homes of his mom, dad and ex-wife; they’ve made the onetime Donald Trump voter and self-described “redneck cop” afraid of what might happen to him in the isolated rural hunting redoubt that used to be his “safe place” away from the life of an urban vice officer. But when his take-no-prisoners memoir about his experience lands next week, the main targets of his scorn won’t be the random extremists ranting on sidewalks and raving on Telegram. Instead, he’s taking swings at the bigwigs who Fanone says have sought to sweep Jan. 6 under the rug.\n \n  \n The average score-settling memoir is apt to devolve into a he-said/she-said news cycle. Some of the conversations depicted in Fanone’s Hold the Line\",\"_id\":\"00000183-b2da-d824-a1d7-b7faf6370000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Hold the Line have a key difference: The author made surreptitious recordings of his interactions with the likes of House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, national Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes, and leaders of Fanone’s own local, among others. Other conversations, with people such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, weren’t recorded but are recounted in cringey detail.\n \n Thus we see McCarthy, finally taking a meeting with Fanone, fellow Jan. 6 hero Harry Dunn, and the mother of late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, lamely try to run out the clock on their conversation. We see Graham snap at Gladys Sicknick that “we’re going to end the meeting right now” if she keeps speaking ill of Trump. And we see Yoes telling Fanone that he’s waiting for direction from the local lodge about Jan. 6 advocacy — and the leader of that lodge telling Fanone that “I’m hesitant to start putting out information one way or the other about January 6” because of political divisions among membership.\n \n  \n There are also cameos by Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson, and Rep. Andrew Clyde, the man who referred to Jan. 6 as a “normal tourist visit” and later drew flak for refusing to shake Fanone’s hand.\n In toto, the interactions add up to a bunch of influential people telling Fanone that, although they may personally support him, they won’t do anything public to speak up against the significant portion of the population who think the insurrection was somehow fake.\n \n  \n “I approached those interactions in the same way that I approached doing an undercover drug buy or participating in any other narcotics operation,” Fanone tells me. “I’d casually make the drive to the Hill, relax myself” using breathing exercises designed to lower blood pressure and calm nerves. “And then the minute I parked my car and got out, it was like, you just turn a switch on.

2020, the people behind the Lincoln Project told a big, seductive myth about themselves. The former GOP operatives gone rogue — who created some of the 2020 cycle’s most vicious, viral ads against Donald Trump — considered themselves an unlikely defense against an existential threat to democracy, a black-ops squad fighting an autocrat with an even blacker soul. “There’s nothing noble about us. But we’re useful,” co-founder Stuart Stevens says at one point in “The Lincoln Project,” the new Showtime documentary series that chronicles the super PAC’s meteoric rise and partial fall. “And if you really believe this is a fight for democracy … you need every useful sonofabitch you can get on your side.”</p> <p>Trump did indeed lose, and while it’s impossible to draw a straight line between viral videos and actual votes, the Lincoln Project was more than willing to take some credit. The series acknowledges what the group did accomplish in 2020: getting under Trump’s skin, raising $90 million in donations, offering regular doses of catharsis to the Trump-hating half of the country. But all of that effort only went so far. Trump still got 74 million votes; he still looms in 2022 and 2024; Trump knockoffs abound in this year’s midterm elections. And one scene in the series, a few episodes earlier, offers a compelling theory of why.</p> <p>It takes place a handful of days before the 2020 election, when a top Lincoln Project staffer named Sarah Lenti gets on a Zoom call with her devoutly religious mother, trying to persuade her to vote against Trump. Sarah brings a pro-life colleague onto the call to help, but her mother isn’t having it. “I’m not crazy about him either, but no one is beyond redemption,” she says. And when Sarah explodes in frustration — “Trump is the antithesis of everything that a Godly man should be!” — her mother stays calm. “You are so angry, and you hate him so much. That is what you’re running on instead of running on issues,” she tells her daughter. “I feel like I have a better chance in the pro-life arena with Donald Trump as president and a conservative White House.”</p> <p>The thing is, she’s right — Trump begat <i>Dobbs</i>, which killed<i> Roe </i>— and her logic underscores the limits of the Lincoln Project’s grand ambitions and sweeping rhetoric. “Today, the dividing line in American politics is not between conservatives and liberals. It’s between those who believe in democracy and those who are killing it,” intones the voice-over on one Lincoln Project ad from 2020, but that’s not entirely true. Yes, some of Trump’s 2020 votes were cast by QAnon conspiracy theorists and Capitol stormers and people so steeped in the Trumpworld media bubble that they didn’t know truth from fiction. But some were cast by issue-driven voters who made what they saw as a practical calculation. It’s the same reason so many members of Congress who are less conspiracy-steeped than Marjorie Taylor Greene have stood by Trump, and the reason all of the fact-checking and social-media ranting and skillfully-crafted propaganda will only go so far. A substantial number of voters see who Trump is. They’ve baked it into their worldview. And they’re going to vote for him anyway.</p> <p>Worrying about the future of democracy is a luxury, after all — something you can dwell on when you’re not driven by religious mission or worried about the source of your next paycheck. That’s a dividing line in American politics, too. And as “The Lincoln Project” shows us, political consultants can forget which side of the divide they’re on. As the series follows the leaders of the Super PAC, on Zoom and at their headquarters in the ski resort town of Park City, Utah, we see glorious vistas, an impressive array of Patagonia jackets, and a series of home interiors worthy of spreads in <i>Dwell</i>. But the Lincoln Project founders also remember the days, as they were building their careers, when they made moral calculations of their own.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/76/c7/93d4346541f2bb25bf2aa3d4bb69/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1240188508\"> <br> <p>In truth, the mindset of an ends-driven Trump voter isn’t so different from the mindset of a political operative: a mix of high-minded principle and ruthless practicality. “You can rationalize working with and for candidates … that you agree with in most part, even though you find some of those things objectionable,” Lincoln Project co-founder Ron Steslow tells the filmmakers. Stevens recalls, with a twinge of regret, how he played the race card in campaigns, decades before Trump did it so effectively. “You’re able to convince yourself that the danger of the other side is greater than the flaws of the side that you’re for,” Stevens says. “We played too much on the dark side, but I think pretty much everybody does.”</p> <p>“The Lincoln Project” offers a rare window into this world of idealism and self-denial; its staffers aren’t publicity-shy, and co-directors Fisher Stevens and Karim Amer get access to meetings, planning sessions, conspiratorial phone calls and lengthy bouts of philosophizing. (If the documentary runs a little too long, it’s probably because the monologues are intoxicating, like patriotic candy sprinkled with f-bombs.) The story morphs at some point into internecine drama — clashing egos, secret deals, ugly accusations, a stunning sexual harassment claim — that’s juicy enough to rival HBO’s fictional series “Succession,” on which Fisher Stevens is also an actor.</p> <p>And the series suggests one reason those battles over money and power seem inevitable: Success in this arena has made some people very, very rich. Some Lincoln Project founders seem at least mildly conflicted that the work that brought them so much material wealth also laid the foundation for Trump’s rise. “Is making money out of an outrage machine helping democracy or is it hurting it? And after 30 years, does it wear on your soul? Fuck, yeah,” co-founder Mike Madrid says as he paints what looks like a fresco in his Sacramento home.</p> <p>But wealth does more than just weigh on these people’s consciences. It creates a blind spot, a disconnect between the heady thinking of the political elite and the way many voters actually behave. Many accounts of Red State America — including Farah Stockman’s recent book <i>American Made</i>, about Indiana workers displaced when their bearing factory moves to Mexico — show how macro-level political and economic decisions, abstractions for people with graduate degrees, can be real-life catastrophes for workers on the frontlines. And people will vote for their own survival before they vote for the nation’s.</p> <p>The people who choose to vote for Trump are taking a calculated risk — assuming that, whatever democratic norms are broken on the way toward a given policy goal, the country will be fine. Lenti’s mother offers a couple of potential reasons why. For one, partly thanks to decades of negative ads produced by countless consultants, she’s cynical about every politician; in that Zoom call, she explains that she doesn’t trust Joe Biden either. (“I wouldn’t want my daughter to date either of ’em, to be perfectly honest,” is how she puts it.) At the same time, she’s willing to believe the best in people, even Donald Trump. “Let’s understand that you know, he can change, too,” she tells her daughter. It’s a generous outlook, though the facts suggest otherwise, and the documentary doesn’t capture what she thought about January 6. But facts don’t stop us from telling stories to ourselves.

No other lawmaker has objected to the plans, a senior State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions.</p> <p>“It is important that any organizational changes actually improve U.S. efforts to compete with China,” Suzanne Wrasse, a spokesperson for the Risch-led minority wing of the Senate committee said in a statement. “As currently presented to the committee, the China House proposal appears to be a bureaucratic power grab, and Sen. Risch won’t relent in his efforts to ensure the proper oversight exists and that China House serves its intended purposes.

James Risch’s office shared the Idaho Republican’s objections with POLITICO on Thursday, several weeks after the department submitted to the House and Senate foreign affairs committees a notification of its plans for China House.\n Creating the unit — essentially a departmental reorganization — to date had been largely uncontroversial. No other lawmaker has objected to the plans, a senior State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions.\n “It is important that any organizational changes actually improve U.S. efforts to compete with China,” Suzanne Wrasse, a spokesperson for the Risch-led minority wing of the Senate committee said in a statement. “As currently presented to the committee, the China House proposal appears to be a bureaucratic power grab, and Sen. Risch won’t relent in his efforts to ensure the proper oversight exists and that China House serves its intended purposes. Until this happens, the China House will not move forward.”\n Risch’s spokesperson did not detail what exactly about the State Department’s proposal he believes constitutes a power grab or would undermine oversight.\n \n \n The developments underscore how, despite bipartisan consensus in Washington that the communist Chinese government poses a long-term threat to U.S. global dominance, cross-party agreement for exactly how to respond can sometimes be hard to get.\n “Our partners in Congress have consistently made the point that they want to do all they can to see to it that the department is equipped to take on this challenge,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. “To that end, we need to be able to move forward as expeditiously as possible with China House to integrate and coordinate our department-wide approach. Given the stakes, we cannot afford a delay.”\n State Department officials have on multiple occasions briefed Risch’s team about China House, people familiar with the issue said. The State Department could, technically, ignore such objections from Capitol Hill and go ahead with its plans. But that breaks with the Biden administration’s preferences and risks political backlash, so the department is unlikely to move forward without Risch’s blessing.\n Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described China House as “a department-wide integrated team that will coordinate and implement our policy across issues and regions, working with Congress as needed.”\n The initiative appears similar to the CIA’s China Mission Center. But there have been questions about whether elements of China House will be redundant given that other State Department units already deal with China. \n Public information about the exact size and scope of China House has been sparse, and it could be many months before the team is fully operational, even if Risch were to sign off quickly.\n Risch has styled himself as a hawk on China issues. He’s given speeches and introduced several bills in recent years that have, among other things, offered more support to Taiwan as the island hopes to fend off a future Chinese invasion.\n \n His block on China House drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers.\n Andrei Vasilescu, a spokesperson for the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s majority wing, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), said that although Senate Republicans “talk tough” on China’s government, “they undermine efforts to bolster the diplomatic resources needed to tackle the China challenge.”\n On Wednesday, President Joe Biden’s administration unveiled its National Security Strategy, which, as expected, cast China as America’s premier long-term geopolitical competitor.","dc:creator":"Nahal Toosi","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/04/1c/e1cb308d4c0abf2287f9effb177f/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1232596498"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Sen.

HPD, as it’s known in the psychiatric sciences, resides in the “Cluster B” garden of personality disorders and is associated with narcissism, attention-seeking behaviors and manipulation. HPDers tend to be charming and lively, often verging into flirtatiousness and excitability. Although the medical literature is silent on the subject of excessive procreation and HPD — Musk has birthed nine children in collaboration with four different uteruses (his wife’s, his girlfriend’s, a surrogate’s, and a senior employee’s) — the tycoon’s breeding tendencies are consistent with the erratic and volatile conduct of those who suffer with the disorder.\n This month, Musk dialed in additional attention to himself. Presumably, there haven’t been enough headlines about his on-again, off-again purchase of Twitter, his alleged romantic interludes, his dope smoking on Joe Rogan, his Tesla overpromising and all the other publicity stunts to stoke his sense of self-importance, so he’s drafted himself as a citizen-diplomat to end the Russian war on Ukraine. What better venue to promote his plan than on Twitter, where on Oct. 3 he proposed a 43-word peace plan that essentially sounded as if it had been scripted by Vladimir Putin, an HPD case if ever there was one, while sitting at his long table.\n Musk’s diplomatic foray earned him condemnation from Ukrainian and European leaders, as did a newsletter item by political consultant Ian Bremmer, alleging that Musk had told Bremmer that he had discussed terms of negotiation with Putin, a charge Musk denies, as does the Kremlin. Until Musk’s next act of grandstanding, pundits and comedians will be asking two questions: Have Musk’s HPD symptoms grown out of control? And, should citizens meddle in foreign policy?\n Oddly, nobody accused Musk of conducting his own foreign policy in late February when he tweeted the news that he had activated his Starlink satellite internet service over Ukraine. His peace plan, as naïve and toadying as it might be, killed nobody, whereas Starlink’s activation likely sent thousands of Russian soldiers to their graves by giving the Ukrainian military a decided advantage over its Russian invaders. By allowing reliable battlefield communications and the spotting and destruction of Russian targets, it has changed the course of the war. As Andrew S. Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace put it to me today, Starlink is “a massive force multiplier that gives them a true edge over the Russian where this war is actually being decided. It far outweighs the significance of any of Musk’s public utterances.”\n The governmental masters of foreign policy have always exhibited mixed feelings about citizen diplomacy. Officially, the U.S. government wants its citizens to act like diplomats. On this State Department page, the Foggy Bottom poohbahs exhort us all to conduct ourselves as citizen diplomats in our international interactions and to use travel and social media to advocate for our country. But our government also keeps on the books the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from corresponding with foreign governments over disputes with the United States unless officially authorized.\n Musk appears to have brushed up against — if not violated — the law if he did talk peace to Putin, as the United States has declared itself on Ukraine’s side. Luckily for Musk, the government almost never enforces the act. Even if Musk did engage in Loganspeak to Putin, his violation would put him in plentiful company. Sens. George McGovern and John Sparkman were accused of violating the act in the 1970s when they contacted the Cuban government. Jesse Jackson caught Logan Act hell several times in his career. Richard Nixon did, too, when it was learned that he told South Vietnam to spurn peace negotiations during his 1968 campaign for president, as did Jimmy Carter when he met with Syria’s Bashar al-Assad in 2008. Some also invoked the Logan Act after it was revealed that while working on the Trump presidential transition, Michael Flynn gave Russia foreign policy advice.\n The question of whether U.S. citizens should conduct foreign policy with U.S. adversaries has been mooted by the fact that the government consistently fails to enforce the act. The debate might slosh and lap around cable news for a couple of nights, the State Department might bare its hairy chest and growl at Musk, but nobody is going investigate him for breaking the law for issuing a peace tweet and allegedly talking about the war with Putin.\n What we can expect in the future from Musk, of course, will be more of the same — more assistance for Ukraine, more attempts at mediating the conflict and most of all, more spectacle. The mental scrapbook where he logs his publicity stunts contains an infinite number of blank pages, and he’s only started to stow his many narcissistic HPD memories. Like Donald Trump before him, he’s not happy unless we’re talking about him. And like Trump, he answers to nobody and can do whatever he wants. On Earth, in space, and maybe soon on Mars.\n ******\n Disclosure: Andrew S. Weiss is a friend.

Catherine Cortez Masto finally edged in front in a new Nevada survey this week.\n But that poll, from Suffolk University and USA Today, wasn't necessarily good news for Democrats' most vulnerable Senate incumbent.\n The toplines showed Cortez Masto, who is seeking a second term, leading GOP nominee Adam Laxalt, 46 percent to 44 percent. That's still better than trailing, but it's also well within the survey's margin of error, and Cortez Masto's vote share is well under the 50 percent threshold that's considered dry land for incumbents.\n That axiom of politics — incumbents under 50 percent are in big trouble — may not be absolute in Cortez Masto's case.\n Whether Cortez Masto can overcome Laxalt given her low poll numbers isn't just an academic argument. Republicans need to net one seat, and given that they trail in the polls in Pennsylvania, almost every realistic path to a GOP Senate majority begins with flipping Nevada.\n Here's what the polls said in Nevada and beyond about the battle to control the Senate this week:\n \n 1.\n Arizona\n MARK KELLY (D) vs. Blake Masters (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Kelly +4.5 (Last week: Kelly +4.1)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +2.7\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n Arizona saw two new polls this week with diverging results — though Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is the leader in both.\n The first poll, from the Phoenix-based firm OH Predictive Insights, made waves: It showed Kelly with a yawning, 13-point lead over Republican Blake Masters, 46 percent to 33 percent. Kelly's large advantage was mostly thanks to Libertarian Marc Victor, who was at 15 percent in the poll, though he has barely registered in other public surveys. (RealClearPolitics' average, referenced above, doesn't include this poll.)\n The other, commissioned from the Georgia-based InsiderAdvantage by KSAZ-TV in Phoenix, staked Kelly to a 4-point lead over Masters, 46 percent to 42 percent, with Victor at just 5 percent.\n Both surveys show Kelly at just 46 percent, treacherous territory for an incumbent. although Masters seems ill-equipped to take advantage. A majority of likely voters in the OH Predictive Insights poll, 51 percent, had an unfavorable opinion of the Republican.\n 2.\n Colorado\n MICHAEL BENNET (D) vs. Joe O'Dea (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Bennet +7.7 (Last week: Bennet +8.3)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +13.5\n A Marist College poll released this week gave Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet a 6-point lead over Republican Joe O'Dea — which narrowed the average slightly, but still showed Bennet at a healthier 49 percent vote share.\n 3.\n Florida\n MARCO RUBIO (R) vs. Val Demings (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Rubio +4.7 (Last week: Rubio +4)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +3.9\nEventual margin: Trump +3.3\n No new polls came out this week in Florida, where recovery continues along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Ian.\n 4.\n Georgia\n RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D) vs. Herschel Walker (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Warnock +3.3 (Last week: Warnock +3.8)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Trump +0.4\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n Six new polls were released this week, though only four of them were conducted entirely after news stories earlier this month about Republican Herschel Walker's ex-girlfriend, who accused the candidate of paying for an abortion 13 years ago.\n Warnock led all six surveys, though by varying margins, from just a 1-point edge in a poll from the Republican-friendly firm Trafalgar Group, to a 12-point blowout in a WXIA-TV/SurveyUSA poll. But, by and large, most polls still give Warnock a low-single-digit lead on the margin — and still shy of the 50-percent threshold needed to clinch victory without a December runoff.\n In all, Walker's numbers have ticked down slightly over the past two weeks. (All of the polls were conducted prior to Friday night's debate between the two men, the only scheduled meeting before the election.)\n \n \n 5.\n Nevada\n CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D) vs. Adam Laxalt (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Laxalt +1.7 (Last week: Laxalt +2.1)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +6\nEventual margin: Biden +2.7\n The Suffolk University/USA Today poll was the only new survey this week in Nevada.\n And while Cortez Masto was at just 46 percent, that's close to the 47.1 percent she earned in 2016, when she defeated then-Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.) to win an open seat.\n There are three third-party or independent candidates on the ballot this fall — in addition to Nevada's infamous \"None of these candidates\" option — so the prevailing candidate could win without a majority of the vote in a close race.\n 6.\n New Hampshire\n MAGGIE HASSAN (D) vs. Don Bolduc (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic \nRCP polling average: Hassan +5.8 (Last week: Hassan +6.6)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +7.2\n The only new survey in New Hampshire this week — conducted for AARP by a bipartisan pair of major polling firms — gave Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan a 7-point lead over Republican Don Bolduc, 52 percent to 45 percent.\n 7.\n North Carolina\n Ted Budd (R) vs. Cheri Beasley (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Budd +1.5 (Last week: Budd +1.5)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +1.9\nEventual margin: Trump +1.3\n No new polls this week in North Carolina, which continues to loom on the periphery of the Senate battlefield.\n \n \n 8.\n Ohio\n J.D. Vance (R) vs. Tim Ryan (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Vance +0.7 (Last week: Vance +1.2)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +0.6\nEventual margin: Trump +8\n Republican J.D. Vance continues to post slight leads in Ohio polls, including three new surveys this week, each showing Vance ahead of Democrat Tim Ryan by 1-to-3 points.\n Two of the polls were from Republican firms: Trafalgar Group and Cygnal, which conducts surveys for GOP candidates and outside groups.\n 9.\n Pennsylvania\n Mehmet Oz (R) vs. John Fetterman (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Fetterman +3.4 (Last week: Fetterman +4.3)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +7.1\nEventual margin: Biden +1.2\n Republican Mehmet Oz still hasn't caught Democrat John Fetterman, though the only new poll this week, from Trafalgar Group for the right-wing website Daily Wire, showed Fetterman with just a 2-point lead, 47 percent to 45 percent.\n 10.\n Wisconsin\n RON JOHNSON (R) vs. Mandela Barnes (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Johnson +2.8 (Last week: Johnson +3)\n2020 RCP polling average 24 days before the election: Biden +5.5\nEventual margin: Biden +0.7\n The Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday showing GOP Sen. Ron Johnson opening a 6-point lead over Democrat Mandela Barnes rocked the toss-up race: It was Johnson's biggest lead in any poll this year.\n There was one poll with more positive signs for Barnes: a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted mostly over the same time frame showed Johnson only ahead by 1 point. But even that is a sign of how the race has changed since the early days after the primary, when Barnes was ahead in survey after survey.","dc:creator":"Steven Shepard","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/84/e5/ad8d7c264d279ef5cca30a617509/leadimage.Shepherd.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Francis Chung/E&E News/POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Republicans need to net one seat, and almost every realistic path to a GOP Senate majority begins with flipping the one held by Sen.

The whole Trump experience would live in national memory as a collective trip to Las Vegas, exhilarating and shameful in equal measure. Now, mouth dry and head throbbing, it was time to fly back home to work, family, sobriety.</p> <p>For all this bombast, Trump seemed destined to share the fate of most one-term presidents, leaving a faint imprint on history.</p> <p>This week, as the Jan. 6 special committee holds its hearing before the midterm elections, is a good moment to take stock of Trump’s astonishing achievement since November 2020. In historical terms, Trump is a larger figure than ever.</p> <p>Far from loosening, his claim on national attention is as urgent as ever. Far from fading into irrelevance, Trump is now positioned to be among the most consequential presidents of his era. This is largely on the strength of what looks to be the most consequential ex-presidency in American history.</p> <p>The usual journalistic crutch when assessing political legacies is “for better or worse,” but in this case it is only for worse. Trump’s historic significance flows from how effectively he has made people doubt what was previously beyond doubt — that American democracy is on the level — and how brilliantly he has illuminated just how much this generation of Americans looks at one another with mutual contempt and mutual incomprehension.</p> <p>Here is the great paradox of the Jan. 6 panel. Its inquiry has systematically dismantled Trump’s deceptions and denialism surrounding the 2020 election. At the same time, it has helped build Trump into something much larger than he appeared two years ago. He is a political leader too serious to forget.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6313718849112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>Based on the old saying that you are winning if they are talking about you no matter what they say is good or bad — can anyone doubt that Trump believes this? — it is clear that Trump’s ex-presidency has been a success. Not many people today talk about Warren G. Harding or Calvin Coolidge. But people will be talking about Donald Trump 100 years from now, and debating how a country found itself so frayed and self-doubting.</p> <p>How many American presidents in 240 years have helped push the country to a place where its very governability was called into question?

The whole Trump experience would live in national memory as a collective trip to Las Vegas, exhilarating and shameful in equal measure. Now, mouth dry and head throbbing, it was time to fly back home to work, family, sobriety.\n For all this bombast, Trump seemed destined to share the fate of most one-term presidents, leaving a faint imprint on history.\n This week, as the Jan. 6 special committee holds its hearing before the midterm elections, is a good moment to take stock of Trump’s astonishing achievement since November 2020. In historical terms, Trump is a larger figure than ever.\n Far from loosening, his claim on national attention is as urgent as ever. Far from fading into irrelevance, Trump is now positioned to be among the most consequential presidents of his era. This is largely on the strength of what looks to be the most consequential ex-presidency in American history.\n The usual journalistic crutch when assessing political legacies is “for better or worse,” but in this case it is only for worse. Trump’s historic significance flows from how effectively he has made people doubt what was previously beyond doubt — that American democracy is on the level — and how brilliantly he has illuminated just how much this generation of Americans looks at one another with mutual contempt and mutual incomprehension.\n Here is the great paradox of the Jan. 6 panel. Its inquiry has systematically dismantled Trump’s deceptions and denialism surrounding the 2020 election. At the same time, it has helped build Trump into something much larger than he appeared two years ago. He is a political leader too serious to forget.\n \n \n Based on the old saying that you are winning if they are talking about you no matter what they say is good or bad — can anyone doubt that Trump believes this? — it is clear that Trump’s ex-presidency has been a success. Not many people today talk about Warren G. Harding or Calvin Coolidge. But people will be talking about Donald Trump 100 years from now, and debating how a country found itself so frayed and self-doubting.\n How many American presidents in 240 years have helped push the country to a place where its very governability was called into question? Of those very few, Trump is the only one to have done it through cult of personality and manufactured issues.\n There have been a few ex-presidents who chose to remain on the leadership stage rather than assume senior statesman status. John Quincy Adams went to the U.S. House as a leader in the anti-slavery movement. William Howard Taft spent nine years as chief justice of the United States. But what other ex-president was regarded as “a clear and present danger to our electoral system and to democratic institutions … a continuing threat,” as Democratic panel member Jamie Raskin put it?\n The paradox of the Jan. 6 committee — simultaneously deflating and inflating Trump — is one more expression of the defining phenomenon of the Trump Years: the contempt paradox.\n This paradox is the root of his appeal. He thrills his supporters because he says and does things that outrage establishment sensibilities. Contempt is the natural response to these outrages. But that contempt in turn generates even more contempt — the lifeblood of the Trump movement — from his supporters.\n One suspects even Trump is surprised by just how much energy could be produced by the contempt cycle, and how long it would last. For seven years, since Trump first vaulted into serious presidential contention in 2015, there has been a tension in how his opponents view him: buffoon or tyrant?\n \n \n Is he an adolescent at large who craves publicity and applause more than genuine power, and spends hours a day watching cable TV and spouting words that he doesn’t actually believe? Or is he someone who brings conscious method to his demagoguery, and is willing to shred any political or constitutional constraint that gets in his way?\n The two interpretations, in fact, were never mutually exclusive, even as they pointed the mind in different directions. What the Jan. 6 panel accomplished was to assemble a vast array of evidence for the second interpretation.

This is not the work of a buffoon.\n It is the work of a leader who can, without an election mandate or any formal constitutional power, set a national agenda and count as the second most powerful person in the country, coming in just behind the leader who defeated him and now holds the White House.\n A new history of Donald Trump by journalists Peter Baker and Susan B. Glasser (a POLITICO alumna) is titled, The Divider. They don’t intend that title as a compliment. But it is worth remembering that it is a description that applies to most consequential presidents.\n “Great presidents are unifiers mostly in retrospect,” the great liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. told me in 1997, as Bill Clinton was preparing for a second term by promising to bridge partisan divides and unify the country. “The greatest presidents have started by dividing the country on important questions, as a way of uniting the country at a new level of understanding.”\n Trump has accomplished one-half of this task.

His swaggering standing and aggressive political posture, according to more than 30 recent interviews and hundreds more over the past several years with aides and ex-aides, strategists and lobbyists, operatives and activists, and current and former elected officials from both parties, reflects a pattern of behavior his allies and supporters chalk up to growing confidence and his critics and opponents see as an increasingly authoritarian bent. But there is nothing in the entirety of DeSantis’ record, most of these people agree, quite like the action he took against Warren.</p> <p>“It’s an abuse of power,” said Kathy Castor, the Democrat in Congress who represents Tampa and some of its suburbs. “It’s anti-democratic.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/cc/69/6102cd47451f8ba636227710e3f4/spot2-1000px.gif\"> <br> <br> <p>“This poses a unique threat to democracy,” Warren told me last week when we met in his South Tampa home. He’s suing DeSantis in federal court in Tallahassee to get his job back — more importantly, though, he insists, to push back against the frightening precedent he believes his dismissal would set. “It poses an existential threat to elections,” Warren said, “if this is allowed to stand.”</p> <p>“He’s thinking it’s smart politics,” said a former DeSantis aide. “I think,” this person added, “this might be one time where he may have overstepped.”</p> <p>It sits, after all, at the outer edge of the evolution of DeSantis in his still only decadelong electoral life. Since 2012, when he ran successfully for Congress from a conservative Northeast Florida district, he’s been a Tea Party backbencher turned upstart, Trump-endorsed (some say Trump-made) gubernatorial candidate turned somewhat center-tacking, pre-pandemic novice executive who over the past 2½ years has become every bit an emboldened, Covid-goaded, base-focused, heavy-handed, hard-charging conservative VIP. For those, though, that have been watching him all along, there is a through-line that’s clear.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fe/51/0d711330432bbc5396099ee226cc/221006-simonetti-politico-02.jpeg\"> <br> <p>“Raw ambition,” said a former adviser.</p> <p>“If the politics of the Republican Party rewarded a New England moderate, or a chamber of commerce Jeb Bush, he would be either one of those,” said David Jolly, the former Republican congressman from the Tampa Bay area who is now an independent. “But he’s chasing where the electoral rewards are, and as a country, as a culture, Covid divided us. And he had to choose sides.” And did.</p> <p>This visceral striving, in the estimation of politicos here and everywhere else, is pointed at a singular goal. By governing the way he’s governed, by running for reelection the way that he has, DeSantis is all but already running for president and has been for a while. Using vast, varied, politically critical Florida as both a training ground and proving ground, the ever-calculating DeSantis has systematically picked what the most revved-up on the right deem as the right fights. He’s called Anthony Fauci “that little elf,” saying “somebody” needs to “chuck him across the Potomac,” and he’s called President Joe Biden “quasi-senile” and “doddering.” Targeting the “corporate media,” “the biomedical security state” and “woke” teachers, professors, agents of justice and private business bosses, he has signed bills that essentially heat-seek to the nation’s most fraught fault lines — from masks and vaccines to critical race theory and “election integrity” to sanctuary cities and LGBTQ rights.

He promised millions of dollars of fines against <i>the Special Olympics</i> because organizers of an event in Orlando wanted to require proof of vaccination. He stripped Disney, the corporate tentpole of the state’s tourist economy, of long-standing tax breaks because the company dared to voice its opposition to the DeSantis-signed bill barring the teaching of gender identity and sexual orientation in early elementary grades. “I’d rather be anti-woke than pro-business,” DeSantis said not long ago during a private meeting — as succinct a mission statement as he’s ever offered of what he thinks appeals at this point to his party’s grassroots.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/ff/d3/2692c9c14671b744ebbff4e7e210/secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>All indications are that it is working to his political favor. In the past two-plus years, he’s raised what is approaching some $200 million. On his campaign website he’s selling taunting baubles such as “Freedom Over Fauci” flip-flops and golf balls that come in a package that crows that “Florida’s Governor Has a Pair.” Polls have reliably predicted he is going to win another term. And that was before President Joe Biden, however enfeebled DeSantis might consider him to be, praised his response to the devastation of Hurricane Ian — “a checkmate moment for Charlie Crist,” as a Florida-based Democratic strategist put it to me, “unfortunately.” In Florida, for the first time ever, registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats. In my conversations of late with professional Democrats and party activists and officials, I heard them refer to Republicans or independents who might have voted for DeSantis in 2018 — but this time won’t, because of any or all of what he’s said or done. Next to nobody, though, is confident there are enough of these people to make a meaningful difference in November. Casey DeSantis, the governor’s wife, a former Jacksonville-market TV show host who by all accounts is at least as politically ambitious as he is, this week cut a straight-to-camera ad about her husband during her battle with breast cancer that landed like both a Crist kill shot and a kickoff to his expected run in 2024.</p> <p>Ron DeSantis is running up the score. But close observers sense in episodes like the ouster of Warren a looming vulnerability as well — what they see, they say, as potentially his most potent opponent. “When every time you swing the bat you hit a home run, you become so caught up and sold on your own abilities that you just keep swinging and never think you’re going to miss,” said John Morgan, the Florida-based mega-attorney and mainly Democratic donor who has been at times nonetheless pro-DeSantis. “It’s emblematic of a view of, ‘I’m like a king, I can do whatever I want, and I’m so popular that nothing’s going to happen to me,’” the former adviser explained. “He has to resist becoming the protagonist in his own Greek tragedy,” said Mac Stipanovich, the one-time Republican operative and political fixture in Tallahassee who, due to Trump, quit the GOP and registered as a Democrat. “Ron DeSantis’ greatest foe right now isn’t Charlie Crist or Donald Trump,” he told me. “It’s hubris.”<br></p> <br> <p>Here on Aug. 4 at the sheriff’s office, at an event billed as a press conference that felt more like a partisan rally in an election year, DeSantis confidently announced the suspension of Warren — “effective immediately,” he said. Sheriffs from adjoining counties dubbed the governor “the greatest governor.” Ashley Moody, the Republican state attorney general, said she was “very, very grateful” for DeSantis’ “strong, attentive, detail-oriented leadership.” And Susan Lopez, the county judge whom he had appointed last year and now already was tapping as Warren’s replacement, thanked DeSantis “for placing his trust in me.”</p> <p>“I <i>have</i> to do this,” the governor said in answering one of the few questions he took from the assemblage of reporters toward the tail end of the nearly 50 minutes.</p> <p>“I understand you have these processes, but quite frankly,” he said, “I don’t think the people of Hillsborough County want to have an agenda that is basically ‘woke,’ where you’re deciding that your view of social justice means certain laws shouldn’t be enforced.”</p> <p>He was asked if he had talked to Warren before making his decision.</p> <p> “No,” he said.</p> <p>“He was the only one who was making those types of declarations. He was the only one signing his name to letters that basically said,” DeSantis said, using words that to his detractors sounded almost unwittingly self-identifying, “‘To hell with the people of Florida, I’m gonna do what I want …’”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4f/0c/b144ba9d49149815d0f5a58876b2/221006-simonetti-politico-10.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>“I didn’t support</b> Governor DeSantis in 2018. But after he won, I had hopes that he would be a good governor,” Warren said last week in his living room here.</p> <p>Warren, 45, grew up in Gainesville, the home of the University of Florida, before going to college at Brandeis near Boston and then Columbia Law in New York. He clerked for a federal judge in San Francisco and then was a Washington-based federal prosecutor with a focus on financial fraud. His wife is an attorney, too, and they have two daughters, 11 and 8, the oldest of whom plays Little League softball. He is an assistant coach for the team. Warren’s status as Hillsborough’s state attorney made him a face of the area’s political shift: His victory in 2016, when he edged out a longtime Republican incumbent, was a signal of Florida’s fourth-most-populous county’s movement from persistently red to more and more blue.</p> <p>In Hillsborough in 2018, DeSantis lost in the primary to establishment candidate Adam Putnam, and he lost, too, in the general. He lost here to Andrew Gillum by 9 points when he won in a state with a population of more than 21 million people by some scant 32,000 votes. But he was elected governor. And it didn’t seem to matter to him by how much. He was keen on wielding power.</p> <p>“I had my transition folks give me a list of all the powers of the governor — the constitutional powers, statutory powers, customary powers. What can I do on my own? What did I need the legislature for?” <a href=\"https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/06/21/desantis-offers-insight-into-how-he-approaches-politics-in-boys-state-speech/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he said earlier this year in a speech in Tallahassee at a Boys State convention&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/06/21/desantis-offers-insight-into-how-he-approaches-politics-in-boys-state-speech/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58850000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58850001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">he said earlier this year in a speech in Tallahassee at a Boys State convention</a>. “What would the courts have to check?” he continued. “You’ve got to be cognizant of where all these pressure points are.” He wanted to know what he could do.

Starting in earnest in April 2020, all of a month into Covid, DeSantis was contrarian and combative in using the weight and the clout of the state — lifting lockdowns, resisting school closures, eliminating mandates of masks and vaccines. Covid surges came and went, and people got sick, and some of them died. He was labeled “DeathSantis” by the left, and he was rewarded by the right, but parents across the political spectrum were at the very least quietly and grudgingly glad that in Florida their kids didn’t have to go to school on a screen. “We were right,” DeSantis has taken to saying, “and they wrong.”</p> <p>“What I hear from others around the country,” said Christian Ziegler, the vice chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, “is that they are shocked at how much he has won.”</p> <p>“I think he was emboldened by his decision-making during Covid,” said Tallahassee lobbyist Nick Iarossi, “and it’s just given him more confidence.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/f1/3d/3688b8c740f1bb793f4846737df5/spot3-1000px.gif\"> <br> <br> <p>But DeSantis didn’t just keep kids in school.

Ever since, on the anniversary of the loss, instead of going to the office, Warren typically volunteers at a soup kitchen to try to keep his mind off the grief. “A part of me is broken that will never be fixed,” <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/hillsborough/2020/11/08/how-did-andrew-warren-become-the-face-of-criminal-justice-in-tampa/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he once told the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> reporter Dan Sullivan&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/news/hillsborough/2020/11/08/how-did-andrew-warren-become-the-face-of-criminal-justice-in-tampa/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58860006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58860007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">he once told the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> reporter Dan Sullivan</a>.</p> <p>This year was different.

He tried to make sense of what it seemed to be saying.</p> <p>“I walked out of the grand jury,” he said, “I started walking up to my office, and I ended up meeting with my chief of staff, and we were in there for maybe two minutes.” Larry Keefe, DeSantis’ “public safety czar,” and an armed major from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office showed up at Warren’s door.</p> <p>“Larry introduced himself and handed me the order of suspension and said, ‘You need to leave the building.’ I asked if I could read it. He said, ‘No.’ I said, “Well, I haven’t had time to read it.’ He said, basically, ‘I don’t care. You need to leave,’” Warren told me now in his living room. “They told me to grab my stuff and leave — and, look, I have tremendous respect for law enforcement. I know not to sit there and argue with him at that moment. That wasn’t the time to have the fight about the legality of this. So, when the major said, ‘Andrew, you need to go,’ I went, ‘OK.’ I grabbed my things.

They were in federal court in Tallahassee a little more than a month later. They argued he should get his job back. Now.</p> <p>The governor of Florida, according to the Constitution of the state, “may suspend from office any state officer … for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony.” But this governor, said Warren’s attorney, Jean-Jacques Cabou, of Phoenix, suspended this state officer not because of what he <i>did</i> but because of what he <i>said</i>. He has prosecutorial discretion. He has the right to “protected speech.”</p> <p>“We are here because the governor issued an executive order that violated the First Amendment,” Cabou told Judge Robert Hinkle, a Bill Clinton nominee. “It also violated the Florida Constitution.”</p> <p>“Andrew Warren has no First Amendment right to say that he is not going to do his job,” said the main attorney representing DeSantis, Florida Solicitor General Henry Whitaker. “What we have here is a state attorney saying he’s not going to do his job.”</p> <p>In court records, prosecutors, judges, attorney generals and current and former law enforcement officials wrote in a brief that what DeSantis did to Warren constituted “executive overreach.” Legal scholars called it “a disturbing attack on democracy.”</p> <p>“Who gets to decide?” Hinkle said in court — the voters or DeSantis? — “and what was the real reason for the removal?” He denied Warren’s motion for a preliminary injunction — for fear, he suggested, that such a stopgap could unsettle the state attorney’s office even more if the decision didn’t stick in the end — but he made clear this vital matter needed to be settled posthaste. “It’s in the public’s interest,” said the judge, “to get to it just as quickly as we can.”</p> <p>He scheduled a trial for Nov. 29 — lightning-fast for courts but still not until three weeks after the election.</p> <p>In the short term, it’s hard to see how this hurts DeSantis.</p> <p>“The court case is irrelevant,” said Ziegler, the state GOP vice chair. “No one,” he said, “is changing their mind based on what the decision of the court is. That all occurred the moment the governor took action.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/32/b6/b24ea26744bc92d9ca1d6d864a7d/gettyimages-1242561442.jpeg\"> <br> <p>It’s hardly just Republicans who think so. Ione Townsend, the chair of the Hillsborough County Democratic Party, told me she knows “three or four people” who she said voted for DeSantis in 2018 but won’t this year because of this — because of the action he took against Warren. She also said they didn’t want to talk about it publicly. I heard a lot of this from a lot of people.</p> <p>“They absolutely exist,” she said, as if she were speaking about some scarce species.</p> <p>But enough of them? To make a difference come November? Townsend doubted it.</p> <p>“We’re too polarized. There are people who come hell or high water they’re going to vote Republican or they’re going to vote Democrat. No matter what. Because we’re in our silos. There are too many Fox News watchers who believe Democrats are pedophiles and eat babies,” she said. “It’s really discouraging.”</p> <p>“When something like this happens, you can for a moment lose your faith in politics,” Warren told me. “But I’ve been encouraged and had my faith restored by not just all the people who’ve rushed to my defense but people who have told me, ‘I didn’t vote for you, but I know this is wrong.’ … I’ve had people tell me, ‘I won’t vote for the governor again because of this.’”</p> <p>“Supporters, former voters, for DeSantis? Who are not anymore? Because of this?” I said.</p> <p>“Correct.”</p> <p> But again — how many?</p> <p>“I don’t know,” he said.</p> <p>It sounded at least to me like a tacit recognition that for every Republican or independent who is outraged by these power plays by DeSantis there probably are at least as many voters who are cheering him on or just don’t know or care. If there is, then, true political peril, it more realistically plays out over a longer arc of time.</p> <p>“If Warren comes back as state attorney in any way, shape or form, I think that’s a loss,” a former DeSantis aide told me. “Like, Charlie Crist couldn’t take him down … Covid couldn’t take him down … but Andrew Warren took him down?” the aide said. “Andrew Warren can’t be his first loss.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/63/58/d3ec24af41b28816b36bfe4bdbb4/spot4-1000px.gif\"> <br> <br> <p><br>“I don’t know that we’ll find out this year, or when we’ll find out, but has he gone, or will he go, too far?” Mac Stipanovich said. “He’s developing blinkers where he’s not seeing the board, in my judgment. Now, it hasn’t cost him anything so far, he keeps being rewarded, and so he keeps up the behavior that produces those rewards. But I think he’s missing things that could come back to bite him.”</p> <p>It is in the end, of course, not about the Warren case as such, or even its eventual upshot. It’s about the precedent.</p> <p>“If Andrew Warren could be suspended for what he did,” Stipanovich said, “then <i>any</i> public official could be suspended for almost <i>anything</i> that they said.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a2/ea/63553d7d413cacc7ecfbcd83a1d8/221006-simonetti-politico-26.jpeg\"> <br> <p>“There’s so much more at stake than my job. This is about making sure that elections have meaning — that we don’t have situations where the governor, from either party, can without justification just remove an elected official and replace that person with whoever he wants,” Warren told me. “If the voters decide that they don’t want me to be the state attorney anymore, I can live with that,” he said. “But I just refuse to accept that the governor can just on a whim suspend an elected official and remove someone and replace them with whoever he wants. That’s not how our democracy works.”</p> <p>Maybe it’s not how it has worked. Maybe it’s not how it should work. But how it actually does work is always in the balance.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/09/ee/af9e930f4b33817edfede8fcbe59/221006-simonetti-politico-21.jpeg\"> <br> <p>After we finished talking at his house, Warren changed into shorts and a T-shirt and drove over to the nearby Little League fields, where he tossed balls to his 11-year-old as she practiced her swing. He told her to focus. He told her to keep at it.</p> <p>“Good cut,” he said.</p> <p>“Head down,” he said.<br></p> <br> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"TAMPA — The morning of the first Thursday of August inside the headquarters of the Hillsborough County sheriff, backed by a battalion of uniformed officers of the law and cheered on by a laughing, clapping crowd, the Republican governor of Florida likened the twice-elected local Democratic state attorney to the spread of disease.\n Citing primarily a pair of joint statements Andrew Warren signed along with scores of other prosecutors that criticized the criminalization of abortion and health care for transgender people, Ron DeSantis matter-of-factly called “obviously warranted” his suspension and “eventual removal.”\n “We are not going to allow this pathogen,” he said, “... of ignoring the law — we are not going to let that get a foothold here.”\n \n  \n DeSantis, 44, is one of America’s preeminent and most powerful governors, an overwhelming favorite over Charlie Crist to be reelected next month, and the most likely 2024 GOP presidential nominee not named Donald Trump. His swaggering standing and aggressive political posture, according to more than 30 recent interviews and hundreds more over the past several years with aides and ex-aides, strategists and lobbyists, operatives and activists, and current and former elected officials from both parties, reflects a pattern of behavior his allies and supporters chalk up to growing confidence and his critics and opponents see as an increasingly authoritarian bent. But there is nothing in the entirety of DeSantis’ record, most of these people agree, quite like the action he took against Warren.\n “It’s an abuse of power,” said Kathy Castor, the Democrat in Congress who represents Tampa and some of its suburbs. “It’s anti-democratic.”\n \n  \n  \n“This poses a unique threat to democracy,” Warren told me last week when we met in his South Tampa home. He’s suing DeSantis in federal court in Tallahassee to get his job back — more importantly, though, he insists, to push back against the frightening precedent he believes his dismissal would set. “It poses an existential threat to elections,” Warren said, “if this is allowed to stand.”\n “He’s thinking it’s smart politics,” said a former DeSantis aide. “I think,” this person added, “this might be one time where he may have overstepped.”\n It sits, after all, at the outer edge of the evolution of DeSantis in his still only decadelong electoral life. Since 2012, when he ran successfully for Congress from a conservative Northeast Florida district, he’s been a Tea Party backbencher turned upstart, Trump-endorsed (some say Trump-made) gubernatorial candidate turned somewhat center-tacking, pre-pandemic novice executive who over the past 2½ years has become every bit an emboldened, Covid-goaded, base-focused, heavy-handed, hard-charging conservative VIP. For those, though, that have been watching him all along, there is a through-line that’s clear.\n \n  \n “Raw ambition,” said a former adviser.\n “If the politics of the Republican Party rewarded a New England moderate, or a chamber of commerce Jeb Bush, he would be either one of those,” said David Jolly, the former Republican congressman from the Tampa Bay area who is now an independent. “But he’s chasing where the electoral rewards are, and as a country, as a culture, Covid divided us. And he had to choose sides.” And did.\n This visceral striving, in the estimation of politicos here and everywhere else, is pointed at a singular goal. By governing the way he’s governed, by running for reelection the way that he has, DeSantis is all but already running for president and has been for a while. Using vast, varied, politically critical Florida as both a training ground and proving ground, the ever-calculating DeSantis has systematically picked what the most revved-up on the right deem as the right fights. He’s called Anthony Fauci “that little elf,” saying “somebody” needs to “chuck him across the Potomac,” and he’s called President Joe Biden “quasi-senile” and “doddering.” Targeting the “corporate media,” “the biomedical security state” and “woke” teachers, professors, agents of justice and private business bosses, he has signed bills that essentially heat-seek to the nation’s most fraught fault lines — from masks and vaccines to critical race theory and “election integrity” to sanctuary cities and LGBTQ rights. He attacked a bar in Miami because of its hosting of drag shows. He promised millions of dollars of fines against the Special Olympics because organizers of an event in Orlando wanted to require proof of vaccination. He stripped Disney, the corporate tentpole of the state’s tourist economy, of long-standing tax breaks because the company dared to voice its opposition to the DeSantis-signed bill barring the teaching of gender identity and sexual orientation in early elementary grades. “I’d rather be anti-woke than pro-business,” DeSantis said not long ago during a private meeting — as succinct a mission statement as he’s ever offered of what he thinks appeals at this point to his party’s grassroots.\n \n  \n All indications are that it is working to his political favor. In the past two-plus years, he’s raised what is approaching some $200 million. On his campaign website he’s selling taunting baubles such as “Freedom Over Fauci” flip-flops and golf balls that come in a package that crows that “Florida’s Governor Has a Pair.” Polls have reliably predicted he is going to win another term. And that was before President Joe Biden, however enfeebled DeSantis might consider him to be, praised his response to the devastation of Hurricane Ian — “a checkmate moment for Charlie Crist,” as a Florida-based Democratic strategist put it to me, “unfortunately.” In Florida, for the first time ever, registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats. In my conversations of late with professional Democrats and party activists and officials, I heard them refer to Republicans or independents who might have voted for DeSantis in 2018 — but this time won’t, because of any or all of what he’s said or done. Next to nobody, though, is confident there are enough of these people to make a meaningful difference in November. Casey DeSantis, the governor’s wife, a former Jacksonville-market TV show host who by all accounts is at least as politically ambitious as he is, this week cut a straight-to-camera ad about her husband during her battle with breast cancer that landed like both a Crist kill shot and a kickoff to his expected run in 2024.\n Ron DeSantis is running up the score. But close observers sense in episodes like the ouster of Warren a looming vulnerability as well — what they see, they say, as potentially his most potent opponent. “When every time you swing the bat you hit a home run, you become so caught up and sold on your own abilities that you just keep swinging and never think you’re going to miss,” said John Morgan, the Florida-based mega-attorney and mainly Democratic donor who has been at times nonetheless pro-DeSantis. “It’s emblematic of a view of, ‘I’m like a king, I can do whatever I want, and I’m so popular that nothing’s going to happen to me,’” the former adviser explained. “He has to resist becoming the protagonist in his own Greek tragedy,” said Mac Stipanovich, the one-time Republican operative and political fixture in Tallahassee who, due to Trump, quit the GOP and registered as a Democrat. “Ron DeSantis’ greatest foe right now isn’t Charlie Crist or Donald Trump,” he told me. “It’s hubris.”\n \n Here on Aug. 4 at the sheriff’s office, at an event billed as a press conference that felt more like a partisan rally in an election year, DeSantis confidently announced the suspension of Warren — “effective immediately,” he said. Sheriffs from adjoining counties dubbed the governor “the greatest governor.” Ashley Moody, the Republican state attorney general, said she was “very, very grateful” for DeSantis’ “strong, attentive, detail-oriented leadership.” And Susan Lopez, the county judge whom he had appointed last year and now already was tapping as Warren’s replacement, thanked DeSantis “for placing his trust in me.”\n “I have to do this,” the governor said in answering one of the few questions he took from the assemblage of reporters toward the tail end of the nearly 50 minutes.\n “I understand you have these processes, but quite frankly,” he said, “I don’t think the people of Hillsborough County want to have an agenda that is basically ‘woke,’ where you’re deciding that your view of social justice means certain laws shouldn’t be enforced.”\n He was asked if he had talked to Warren before making his decision.\n  “No,” he said.\n “He was the only one who was making those types of declarations. He was the only one signing his name to letters that basically said,” DeSantis said, using words that to his detractors sounded almost unwittingly self-identifying, “‘To hell with the people of Florida, I’m gonna do what I want …’”\n \n  \n  \n“I didn’t support Governor DeSantis in 2018. But after he won, I had hopes that he would be a good governor,” Warren said last week in his living room here.\n Warren, 45, grew up in Gainesville, the home of the University of Florida, before going to college at Brandeis near Boston and then Columbia Law in New York. He clerked for a federal judge in San Francisco and then was a Washington-based federal prosecutor with a focus on financial fraud. His wife is an attorney, too, and they have two daughters, 11 and 8, the oldest of whom plays Little League softball. He is an assistant coach for the team. Warren’s status as Hillsborough’s state attorney made him a face of the area’s political shift: His victory in 2016, when he edged out a longtime Republican incumbent, was a signal of Florida’s fourth-most-populous county’s movement from persistently red to more and more blue.\n In Hillsborough in 2018, DeSantis lost in the primary to establishment candidate Adam Putnam, and he lost, too, in the general. He lost here to Andrew Gillum by 9 points when he won in a state with a population of more than 21 million people by some scant 32,000 votes. But he was elected governor. And it didn’t seem to matter to him by how much. He was keen on wielding power.\n “I had my transition folks give me a list of all the powers of the governor — the constitutional powers, statutory powers, customary powers. What can I do on my own? What did I need the legislature for?” he said earlier this year in a speech in Tallahassee at a Boys State convention. “What would the courts have to check?” he continued. “You’ve got to be cognizant of where all these pressure points are.” He wanted to know what he could do. He also, and relatedly, wanted to advance his own political aims. “It is the governor’s desire to fundraise and maintain a high political profile at all times — inside and outside of Florida,” a top adviser wrote in a memo to his chief of staff not even three weeks into his term, Tampa Bay Times\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/09/12/ron-desantis-political-team-planned-25k-golf-games-250k-intimate-gatherings-memos-say/\",\"_id\":\"00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58850002\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58850003\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">according to reporting by the Tampa Bay Times.\n At least initially, though, the manner with which DeSantis chose to advance those aims in retrospect was almost shockingly … moderate? Looking back, he doesn’t even sound like the same guy, evincing an attitude of almost live-and-let-live.\n It caught even a lot of Democrats by surprise. “I agreed with some of the things that he did,” Warren told me now, listing DeSantis’ pardon of the so-called Groveland Four in a longstanding case of racial injustice, his prioritization of hundreds of millions of dollars of funding for Everglades restoration and his effort to boost teacher pay in Florida’s public schools. DeSantis teamed with Morgan, the attorney and Democratic donor, to help enable the state’s legalization of medical marijuana. “Who am I to judge?” the new governor said. “I want people to be able to have their suffering relieved.” He went so far as to veto a bill in the legislature that wanted to nix local bans of plastic straws.\n “The governor said, ‘Look, if you don’t want a straw ban in place, then elect county commissioners or city councilmen who aren’t going to pass a straw ban. This isn’t something the state should be doing,’” Warren told me.\n \n  \n “Contrast that,” he said, pivoting and somewhat perplexed, “with the governor who has said, ‘We’re going to dictate to localities about how they handle Covid.’”\n The delineation of a pre-Covid and post-Covid DeSantis is a tad too tidy — he’s received continued plaudits from environmentalists, for instance, and the pay raises for teachers haven’t stopped —but the shift in vibes and approach since Covid and his resulting (depending on one’s perspective) celebrity or notoriety are hard to ignore. Provocations like the STOP W.O.K.E. Act, the “Parental Rights in Education” bill that critics took to calling “Don’t Say Gay”, the outrage- and headline-generating, Florida taxpayer-paid migrant flight from Texas to the liberal Northeast haven of Martha’s Vineyard — they’re of a piece with his new, more muscular, more sneering, pandemic-spurred stance. Starting in earnest in April 2020, all of a month into Covid, DeSantis was contrarian and combative in using the weight and the clout of the state — lifting lockdowns, resisting school closures, eliminating mandates of masks and vaccines. Covid surges came and went, and people got sick, and some of them died. He was labeled “DeathSantis” by the left, and he was rewarded by the right, but parents across the political spectrum were at the very least quietly and grudgingly glad that in Florida their kids didn’t have to go to school on a screen. “We were right,” DeSantis has taken to saying, “and they wrong.”\n “What I hear from others around the country,” said Christian Ziegler, the vice chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, “is that they are shocked at how much he has won.”\n “I think he was emboldened by his decision-making during Covid,” said Tallahassee lobbyist Nick Iarossi, “and it’s just given him more confidence.”\n \n  \n  \nBut DeSantis didn’t just keep kids in school. He turned Covid into his name-making crusade. Specifically in Hillsborough County a pro-Trump Pentecostal pastor violated stay-at-home orders by continuing to hold services at his Tampa megachurch. Deputies arrested him. Warren’s office started to prosecute him. And then DeSantis quickly eased the rules for churches. Warren went on CNN to call the decision “spineless” and “weak.”\n DeSantis clearly saw political opportunity. “Like Pavlov’s dogs,” Stipanovich said. “The bell rings, he gets fed — some positive feedback in terms of his popularity or press in the right-wing media silo, and one thing leads to another — ding, ding, ding — until that’s all he does.”\n In response in part to the riots in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, DeSantis, for example, signed an “anti-rioting” bill — “an unapologetic stand for the rule of law” following “civil unrest throughout the United States over the last two years,” in his and his office’s words. Warren, who was reelected in 2020 by more votes just in Hillsborough County than DeSantis had won by in the whole state in 2018, was appalled. “It tears a couple corners off the Constitution,” he said in a statement, adding that the “misguided” legislation “directly undermines First Amendment freedoms by criminalizing peaceful protests.”\n In June 2021, Warren, with more than 70 other prosecutors around the country, signed the joint statement from Fair and Just Prosecution about gender-affirming care. “As elected prosecutors and law enforcement leaders, we condemn the ongoing efforts to criminalize transgender people,” the statement began.\n Then this past summer, after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, he was one of even more prosecutors — serving in New York, California and Massachusetts, but also Ohio, Mississippi and Texas — to sign another joint statement from the organization “promoting a justice system grounded in fairness, equity, compassion and fiscal responsibility.” Some of the key language: “… we decline to use our offices’ resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide or support abortions,” it said. “Criminalizing and prosecuting individuals who seek or provide abortion care makes a mockery of justice; prosecutors should not be part of that,” it concluded.\n \n  \n It did not go unnoticed by DeSantis in Tallahassee. And all of it set the stage for early August here in Tampa. “MAJOR announcement,” DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw teased on Twitter. “Prepare for the liberal media meltdown of the year.”\n Warren usually doesn’t work on August 4. He and his wife have their two daughters. But their first child was a son named Zack. On August 4, 2009, Alexandra Coler Warren got into a car accident. She was eight months pregnant. The baby didn’t survive. Ever since, on the anniversary of the loss, instead of going to the office, Warren typically volunteers at a soup kitchen to try to keep his mind off the grief. “A part of me is broken that will never be fixed,” Tampa Bay Times reporter Dan Sullivan\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/hillsborough/2020/11/08/how-did-andrew-warren-become-the-face-of-criminal-justice-in-tampa/\",\"_id\":\"00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58860006\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58860007\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">he once told the Tampa Bay Times reporter Dan Sullivan.\n This year was different. His office had exonerated a man who had been convicted of a murder in 1983, and a grand jury was ready to issue a new indictment, and so Warren wanted to oversee the process.\n He noticed on his phone a strange email. Suspension. He tried to make sense of what it seemed to be saying.\n “I walked out of the grand jury,” he said, “I started walking up to my office, and I ended up meeting with my chief of staff, and we were in there for maybe two minutes.” Larry Keefe, DeSantis’ “public safety czar,” and an armed major from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office showed up at Warren’s door.\n “Larry introduced himself and handed me the order of suspension and said, ‘You need to leave the building.’ I asked if I could read it. He said, ‘No.’ I said, “Well, I haven’t had time to read it.’ He said, basically, ‘I don’t care. You need to leave,’” Warren told me now in his living room. “They told me to grab my stuff and leave — and, look, I have tremendous respect for law enforcement. I know not to sit there and argue with him at that moment. That wasn’t the time to have the fight about the legality of this. So, when the major said, ‘Andrew, you need to go,’ I went, ‘OK.’ I grabbed my things. And he walked me out.”\n He didn’t even sit down until later that night to read in full Executive Order Number 22-176.\n “WHEREAS, Article IV of the Florida Constitution vests the State’s supreme executive power in the Governor …”\n \n  \n  \nDeSantis takes decisive action, enthusiasm on the right, outrage on the left — it’s become the predictable rhythm of his administration as well as the fuel for his national ascent. Harder to follow — but no less important — are the legal challenges that also have become a not just familiar but fundamental drumbeat of his Tallahassee tenure. Vaccines and voting, redistricting and abortion, “Stop W.O.K.E.” and “Don’t Say Gay,” Martha’s Vineyard and the free-speech rights of University of Florida professors — What would the courts have to check? — and now atop the active list of where all these pressure points are sits Warren v. DeSantis.\n The attorneys for the suspended state attorney filed their suit against the governor in the middle of August. They were in federal court in Tallahassee a little more than a month later. They argued he should get his job back. Now.\n The governor of Florida, according to the Constitution of the state, “may suspend from office any state officer … for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony.” But this governor, said Warren’s attorney, Jean-Jacques Cabou, of Phoenix, suspended this state officer not because of what he did but because of what he said. He has prosecutorial discretion. He has the right to “protected speech.”\n “We are here because the governor issued an executive order that violated the First Amendment,” Cabou told Judge Robert Hinkle, a Bill Clinton nominee. “It also violated the Florida Constitution.”\n “Andrew Warren has no First Amendment right to say that he is not going to do his job,” said the main attorney representing DeSantis, Florida Solicitor General Henry Whitaker. “What we have here is a state attorney saying he’s not going to do his job.”\n In court records, prosecutors, judges, attorney generals and current and former law enforcement officials wrote in a brief that what DeSantis did to Warren constituted “executive overreach.” Legal scholars called it “a disturbing attack on democracy.”\n “Who gets to decide?” Hinkle said in court — the voters or DeSantis? — “and what was the real reason for the removal?” He denied Warren’s motion for a preliminary injunction — for fear, he suggested, that such a stopgap could unsettle the state attorney’s office even more if the decision didn’t stick in the end — but he made clear this vital matter needed to be settled posthaste. “It’s in the public’s interest,” said the judge, “to get to it just as quickly as we can.”\n He scheduled a trial for Nov. 29 — lightning-fast for courts but still not until three weeks after the election.\n In the short term, it’s hard to see how this hurts DeSantis.\n “The court case is irrelevant,” said Ziegler, the state GOP vice chair. “No one,” he said, “is changing their mind based on what the decision of the court is. That all occurred the moment the governor took action.”\n \n  \n It’s hardly just Republicans who think so. Ione Townsend, the chair of the Hillsborough County Democratic Party, told me she knows “three or four people” who she said voted for DeSantis in 2018 but won’t this year because of this — because of the action he took against Warren. She also said they didn’t want to talk about it publicly. I heard a lot of this from a lot of people.\n “They absolutely exist,” she said, as if she were speaking about some scarce species.\n But enough of them? To make a difference come November? Townsend doubted it.\n “We’re too polarized. There are people who come hell or high water they’re going to vote Republican or they’re going to vote Democrat. No matter what. Because we’re in our silos. There are too many Fox News watchers who believe Democrats are pedophiles and eat babies,” she said. “It’s really discouraging.”\n “When something like this happens, you can for a moment lose your faith in politics,” Warren told me. “But I’ve been encouraged and had my faith restored by not just all the people who’ve rushed to my defense but people who have told me, ‘I didn’t vote for you, but I know this is wrong.’ … I’ve had people tell me, ‘I won’t vote for the governor again because of this.’”\n “Supporters, former voters, for DeSantis? Who are not anymore? Because of this?” I said.\n “Correct.”\n  But again — how many?\n “I don’t know,” he said.\n It sounded at least to me like a tacit recognition that for every Republican or independent who is outraged by these power plays by DeSantis there probably are at least as many voters who are cheering him on or just don’t know or care. If there is, then, true political peril, it more realistically plays out over a longer arc of time.\n “If Warren comes back as state attorney in any way, shape or form, I think that’s a loss,” a former DeSantis aide told me. “Like, Charlie Crist couldn’t take him down … Covid couldn’t take him down … but Andrew Warren took him down?” the aide said. “Andrew Warren can’t be his first loss.”\n \n  \n  \n“I don’t know that we’ll find out this year, or when we’ll find out, but has he gone, or will he go, too far?” Mac Stipanovich said. “He’s developing blinkers where he’s not seeing the board, in my judgment. Now, it hasn’t cost him anything so far, he keeps being rewarded, and so he keeps up the behavior that produces those rewards. But I think he’s missing things that could come back to bite him.”\n It is in the end, of course, not about the Warren case as such, or even its eventual upshot. It’s about the precedent.\n “If Andrew Warren could be suspended for what he did,” Stipanovich said, “then any public official could be suspended for almost anything that they said.”\n \n  \n “There’s so much more at stake than my job. This is about making sure that elections have meaning — that we don’t have situations where the governor, from either party, can without justification just remove an elected official and replace that person with whoever he wants,” Warren told me. “If the voters decide that they don’t want me to be the state attorney anymore, I can live with that,” he said. “But I just refuse to accept that the governor can just on a whim suspend an elected official and remove someone and replace them with whoever he wants. That’s not how our democracy works.”\n Maybe it’s not how it has worked. Maybe it’s not how it should work. But how it actually does work is always in the balance.\n \n  \n After we finished talking at his house, Warren changed into shorts and a T-shirt and drove over to the nearby Little League fields, where he tossed balls to his 11-year-old as she practiced her swing. He told her to focus. He told her to keep at it.\n “Good cut,” he said.\n “Head down,” he said.","dc:creator":"Michael Kruse","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/2f/e6/344d28a34150a2c57aab3030056a/desantis-lede-static.jpg"},"media:title":[{"_":"Illustrations by Doug Chayka for POLITICO","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/2f/e6/344d28a34150a2c57aab3030056a/desantis-lede-static.jpg"}}]},"content":"The Florida governor’s increasingly aggressive gambits make some wonder if he’s headed for a fall.","contentSnippet":"The Florida governor’s increasingly aggressive gambits make some wonder if he’s headed for a fall.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/14/desantis-greatest-foe-its-hubris-00061211","isoDate":"2022-10-14T08:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    The Way Parents Talk About Halloween Candy Is A Harmful, Toxic Mess\n\n","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stop-talking-about-halloween-candy-in-front-of-your-kids_l_63457679e4b0e376dc061124","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 05:45:03 -0400","content:encoded":"\n\n    If you want your kids to have a healthy relationship with food and their bodies, you may need to tone down your negativity about this Halloween tradition.\n\n","content:encodedSnippet":"If you want your kids to have a healthy relationship with food and their bodies, you may need to tone down your negativity about this Halloween tradition.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/63472e5b27000033002a4453.jpeg?cache=ye0cv2beoj&ops=224_126"},"comments":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stop-talking-about-halloween-candy-in-front-of-your-kids_l_63457679e4b0e376dc061124#comments","content":"\n\n    If you want your kids to have a healthy relationship with food and their bodies, you may need to tone down your negativity about this Halloween tradition.\n\n","contentSnippet":"If you want your kids to have a healthy relationship with food and their bodies, you may need to tone down your negativity about this Halloween tradition.","guid":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stop-talking-about-halloween-candy-in-front-of-your-kids_l_63457679e4b0e376dc061124","isoDate":"2022-10-13T09:45:03.000Z"},{"title":"A 'tectonic shift' in global wealth that will take years to recover from","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/investing/premarket-trading-stocks/index.html","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 14:09:08 GMT","content":"Markets plunged on Thursday morning after red-hot inflation data raised fears on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve would continue hiking interest rates aggressively.

But as their list of potential pickups shrinks, they're staring down a 2023 that may start with another 50-50 chamber: At the moment average polling forecasts exactly that, and POLITICO currently rates control of the chamber a toss-up.\n Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is pulling ahead against his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, according to the latest polls, while Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman's advantage over GOP foe Mehmet Oz has shrunk. And Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) is in essentially a dead heat against GOP challenger Adam Laxalt, who has taken a slight lead in recent polls.\n The tightening races, and fear of a narrow GOP takeover, are leading to some finger-pointing about the top Senate Democratic super PAC’s performance, particularly in prime potential pick-up states.\n Asked about the possibility of another Senate locked at 50-50, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) sighed.\n “Lord … obviously we would prefer it to having less. But we’ll feel like it’s the myth of Sisyphus or something,” he said, referring to the Greek mythological tale of a man doomed to push the same stone around. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, he added, will feel like “I’ve been trying to roll a boulder up the hill, and it’s rolled back on top of me.”\n In a statement to POLITICO, Schumer said: “This 50/50 Senate was one of the most productive the Senate has ever seen, so if that’s the case again next Congress we’ll aspire for the same.”\n \n The New York Democrat indeed managed to secure bipartisan wins on infrastructure, gun safety and microchips on top of two major party-line victories. And he’s transferred from his war chest $1 million each to Barnes and Fetterman. But some party operatives see Senate Majority PAC, the caucus’ main outside group, as contributing to its candidates’ recent stumbles.\n The super PAC has gotten outspent by its GOP counterpart, the Mitch McConnell-affiliated Senate Leadership Fund, down the home stretch. That's negated some Democratic fundraising advantages and raised eyebrows within the party about Senate Majority PAC's strategy. Some Democrats have also complained that the group hasn’t gone for the jugular enough.\n “I think the current polling speaks for itself,” said Irene Lin, a Democratic strategist who managed Wisconsin Senate hopeful Tom Nelson’s campaign during the state’s 2022 primary. Lin added that the Senate Democratic super PAC was not solely to blame for Barnes not having adequate air cover, but contended that its ads “clearly didn’t penetrate message-wise.”\n She recounted hearing from Barnes supporters \"seeing ad after ad against Mandela on crime and his taxes, and begging for a response from Dems, and saying they didn’t see any,\" observing that Johnson “started as the second most unpopular senator in America, and his approvals have gone up!”\n Senate Majority PAC spokesperson Veronica Yoo said in a statement: \"We have 23 days left to elect John Fetterman and Mandela Barnes, and defend our Democratic Senate majority — that’s what we’re focusing on and we encourage our fellow Democrats to do the same.”\n In Pennsylvania, Democrats’ best pick-up opportunity, a person with knowledge of the inner workings of the Fetterman campaign said there has been “widespread disappointment” and “perplexity” about Senate Majority PAC’s efforts in the state. A second person similarly situated described “frustration” while a third person close to Fetterman's camp said “we felt a little bit exposed in September and were really holding our breath, and things feel better on the ground now.”\n \n \n Fetterman adviser Rebecca Katz said in a statement that “they’ve got smart people and we’ve got smart people. We’re all focused on winning.”\n Doc Sweitzer, a Pennsylvania Democratic media consultant, said Senate Majority PAC initially failed to keep its foot on the gas after Oz won May's primary.\n “If you're fighting anybody, you can't let them up off the ground.

The Senate GOP super PAC's spending in both states, meanwhile, has stayed largely the same.\n POLITICO currently lists Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as Senate toss-ups. If Cortez Masto loses in Nevada and Fetterman takes Pennsylvania, but party control of all other tossups remains the same, it’s a 50-50 Senate again.\n In Georgia, the race between Sen. Raphael Warnock and former football star Herschel Walker remains close, even after the anti-abortion Walker's struggles to explain a report he paid for an abortion. An Emerson College poll released this week found Warnock with 48 percent support and Walker at 46 percent.\n \n \n If neither senator breaks 50 percent on Election Day, the race will go to another run-off in December — a repeat of the 2020 election that yielded the current 50-50 Senate.\n And in Wisconsin, the latest poll from Marquette Law School released Wednesday has 52 percent of likely voters supporting Johnson, with 46 percent for Barnes. In the battleground states of Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republicans recently slashed ad buys, Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) are leading the polls.\n “Democrats have put Republicans on defense across the Senate map — our incumbents are well positioned for victory and we have multiple pickup opportunities that remain strongly in play,” said David Bergstein, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “We're focused on doing the work we need to protect and expand Democrats' Senate majority, and every other Democrat who wants to win should do the same.\"\n Another evenly divided Senate would continue leaving Democrats no margin for error, particularly on confirmations of President Joe Biden's nominees.

Instead, 25 days later we continue to get a piecemeal release of records.”\n Text messages between Keefe and Uthmeier on Sept. 5 also indicate that officials in Texas were aware of Florida’s program and knew the flights were coming.\n “TX is aware of Dash, FYI,” Uthmeier wrote on Sept. 5. “No worries here.”\n \n \n “Texas is aware and good with Dash?” Keefe responds. “Please confirm.”\n “Call when convenient,” Uthmeier responded.\n It’s unclear who or what “dash” is and questions to DeSantis’ office for clarification were not returned.\n Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has said he was not involved in DeSantis’ flights from his state to Martha’s Vineyard. But his administration has bused thousands of migrants from the southern border to blue strongholds, including New York City and Chicago. Abbott has also bused dozens of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’ Washington, D.C. residence. His office did not respond to requests for comment about the Texas messages indicating Texas was “aware” of some version of the Florida plans.\n While DeSantis has only executed one transport, his administration on Sept., 20 appeared to be organizing another flight of migrants, this time to President Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware, which was first reported by the Miami Herald.\n Records at the time showed a flight operated by the same vendor as the Martha’s Vineyard flights was headed to Nashville, then New Jersey, which set off immigration groups in those cities to rush to the airport to provide any services the migrants might need. Flight records at the time showed a flight operated by the same vendor as the Martha’s Vineyard flights were headed to Delaware.\n That flight, though, was canceled, stranding migrants that had been recruited for the flight stranded in Texas. The Miami Herald reported that a woman identified as “Perla” was the one who showed up at a hotel in San Antonio to recruit them for the flights, and ultimately later abruptly informed them of its cancellation. The New York Times identified “Perla” as Perla Huerta, a military veteran who spent two decades in the U.S. Army.\n “Perla'' also shows up in screenshots of What’s App messages that were sent to Keefe included in the most recent trove of released documents.\n “They will hate me today, but this opportunity no one would have given them,” read one message, written in Spanish, in response to a message that directly referenced “Perla.”\n In another message, at least one migrant seemed to express gratitude for being part of the program, saying they feel like they were put in a “bed of gold.”\n Keefe was hired by DeSantis in Sept. 2021 to serve as Florida’s first-ever public safety czar, a position DeSantis immediately framed as focusing on illegal immigration.\n Keefe previously was a named partner at an Okaloosa County law firm that is among the biggest in the region and on multiple occasions represented Vertol Systems, the vendor the DeSantis administration has so far paid $1.5 million tied to the migrant flight program.\n Gary Fineout contributed to this story.","dc:creator":"Matt

I feel more calm,” she said, as she banked the plane east, making a big circle over the airport. She wore a black and green Jennifer-Ruth Green for Congress polo, a jean skirt, and black and white Chuck Taylor All-Star low tops.<b> </b>She was unwinding from a long day on the campaign trail, with no destination in particular — a rare moment for a hard-charging candidate.</p> <p>Flying is key to Green’s still-evolving political brand. In one ad, she stands in front of a plane, wearing a green civilian flight suit with Civil Air Patrol and Tuskegee Airmen badges sewn on. “I’m not just a pilot,” she says, “or a combat veteran. I’m Jennifer-Ruth Green.” In another ad, she poses in front of a fighter jet with the at-risk kids she mentors in her faith-based, non-profit organization, MissionAero, aimed at introducing youth to careers in the aerospace industry.</p> <p>The sun dipped in the sky. Green looked out of the pilot-side window and pointed to the steel mills that dotted the landscape of this corner of Northwest Indiana, farmland, and the Chicago skyline beyond on the western border of her district’s boundaries. The district includes U.S. Steel’s Gary Works, the largest steel mill in the nation, situated in Gary, a hollowed-out Rust Belt city. Economic refugees who have fled Illinois seeking Indiana’s friendlier tax climate have made this district more competitive in recent cycles, she said.</p> <p>“It’s such an incredibly diverse district,” said Green, who identifies as Black and Asian. “The majority of the district is blue-collar workers who take care of their bills and take care of their families — the middle 80 percent of the country. You don’t have granola bars or tree huggers. Everybody sits in this happy middle.”</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/21/96/15c3f3e545138ed02f2ef25c6a1f/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>The political mood on the ground might not be quite as cheerful. There’s an unexpected amount of drama for a district that hasn’t voted for a Republican in 92 years. Green, 40, is locked in one of the nation’s most competitive congressional races against freshman Democratic incumbent Rep.

Of the 26 Black women in Congress, all are Democrats. Of the Republicans running in the 47 most vulnerable Democratic districts, 38 percent are military veterans, according to the Cook Political Report. Thirty-four percent are women. Twenty-three percent are non-white. Seventy percent are at least one of those things. Green is <i>all three</i>, just one of two candidates on the ballot this November to hold such a distinction.

Later, she would pick up Spanish, French and Tagalog.</p> <p>When she was in kindergarten, her mother went back into the medical field, and so her father watched her after school. “We’d come home and we’d have two hours and it would be either 30 minutes of rest, 30 minutes of piano practice, 30 minutes of chores, 30 minutes of just reading,” Green said. “And then after that, we could all have dinner” — but while giving a 5-minute brief of whatever they had just read.

Her military evaluations praised her for evaluating 24 Iraqi intel course syllabi, something that expedited “curriculum development by months” and “professionalized agent training.” She “personally advised [the] Iraqi equivalent of [the] FBI Academy Director,” according to military records obtained by POLITICO.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/95/79/96fff2f94efb98f520f1e8fa2f5f/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>Green’s mostly stellar military record took an unexpected hit in early 2010, according to military records. In an evaluation of her performance spanning from March 15, 2009 to Dec. 15, 2009, she received a “does not meet standards” rating in leadership skills, professional qualities, and judgment and decisions. The evaluation centered on “two instances of lacking judgment while deployed; handling your weapon and wandering away while at a [forward operating base].”</p> <p>In the first case, she was given a letter of counseling for loading her weapon inside a military facility. The second more serious incident occurred in September, according to her military records, when she and a small group of officers visited the national training center. She left the group to climb into a cramped guard tower where Green says an Iraqi serviceman sexually assaulted her by grabbing her breast and exposing himself.</p> <p>She said she was advised not to report the assault by a staff sergeant, who was also a military equal opportunity representative. He told her that “if American leadership complained to Iraqi leadership, they would continue to see women as liabilities and limit their ability to serve … .”</p> <p>The poor evaluation, which was performed by someone who was not in Iraq with Green, affected her ability to rise in the ranks and in 2012 she was removed from active duty as part of a larger force reduction, according to her records. Green has appealed the evaluation, citing supporting letters from her superiors stationed in Iraq. Her direct supervisor, a senior agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, wrote in her appeal that she “did an outstanding job in her duties; I did not question her leadership, judgment or professional skills.”</p> <p>In 2017, she joined the Indiana Air National Guard. She now serves as a lieutenant colonel and commander and chief information officer. She has received consistently high evaluations.</p> <p>“I’m a survivor of sexual trauma in the military, and I am being forced to discuss it publicly for the first time because Congressman Mrvan or his supporters obtained — either illegally or by egregious error — military records describing my sexual assault as well as performance reviews, and peddled those records to the media with the intent smear me and my military career,” she wrote in a statement to POLITICO. “The performance review being pushed to discredit my leadership is false.” (Green has not contested the authenticity of the documents, which were obtained by a public records request and provided to POLITICO by a person outside the Mrvan campaign.)</p> <p>“After reporting my assault against the advice of officials in my command, my career was intentionally derailed. I appealed the findings with the military and the issue is settled. I have unquestionably progressed as a military member, promoting to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and successfully completed a command tour,” Green wrote in her statement to POLITICO. “As I have always, I will move forward and succeed despite obstacles such as this thrown in my path.”</p> <p>A Department of the Air Force spokesperson said: “We remain committed to building a culture of respect, where sexual assault and harassment are not tolerated in any form and we will do this by supporting victims and prosecuting offenders through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.”<br></p> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Jennifer-Ruth Green Watches the State of the Union</h3> <p><b>G</b>reen settled in to watch the State of the Union in February 2020 on her couch. She watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tear up the pages of the president’s address.</p> <p>“It was a visceral gut reaction. I just felt sick to my stomach,” Green said. Not long after, the political novice decided to run for Congress.</p> <p>“The third most powerful person in the country, knew that for her to have applause, and to have people write a headline about her was more important than making sure that our adversaries didn’t see instability, just led me to believe that there’s a great failure there,” she said.</p> <p>I asked her if what happened a year later on Jan. 6 was perhaps more egregious in terms of demonstrating instability to our enemies.</p> <p>“I would say they would feel that it would be a source of instability as well,” Green said, though with notably less enthusiasm.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/1e/64/d0227b8f4e46a32db63c34de9ebe/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary4.jpg\"> <br> <p>Green entered early into what would become a crowded primary field.</p> <p>In May, Green won her seven-way primary by figuratively hugging Donald Trump, and criticizing her most prominent opponent, Blair Milo, for not attending the 2016 Republican Convention. Milo, the former mayor of LaPorte and a Navy veteran, was the only person in the field who had previously won elected office. In one ad she called Milo a “Never-Trump Liberal,” criticizing her for having reservations about attending the GOP convention in 2016. Now, Green is distancing herself from Trump. “President Trump was just very, very vocal in his style of leadership,” Green says now. “And his personality was not something that I want to emulate.”</p> <p>Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, former ambassador to the United Nations and potential presidential 2024 candidate, arrived in town recently to fundraise for Green, netting her another $20,000 or so as she continues to outraise her Democratic challenger. A few weeks earlier, Green pumped discounted gas alongside former Vice President Mike Pence. The last Republican who ran in this district spent only $14,000 and lost by 16 points. Green racked up more than that in one event, a signal that she is a different kind of GOP candidate.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Jennifer-Ruth Green in Brazil</h3> <p><b>“I</b>’m going to pray for dinner,” Green said, a bacon, cheese and potato omelette and Coke before her at Mi Tierra, a Mexican restaurant at the airport in Griffith. “Dear Lord, thank you very much for this food. Thank you very much for the safety. God, I ask that this food would be blessed to our bodies and help us get back safely to our homes tonight.”</p> <p>Green’s favorite character is Barnabas, a “minister of missionaries,” she says, who helped the Apostle Paul spread the Gospel. She was inspired to get her pilot’s instructor certification in 2015 while on a mission trip in Brazil, where there was a need for pilots to fly into the Amazon.</p> <p>Green sees herself as a political missionary, a cultural translator who can bridge the divide between Republicans and minority communities on issues like the social safety net.</p> <p>“I think when we talk about welfare programs, we just can’t have people who get a job and then all of a sudden you’re cut off entirely,” Green said. “That’s just not an incentive and it’s more debilitating than it is helpful.” On this issue, Green presents herself as a moderate Republican — making her a better fit for a Democratic district.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3f/94/c4cfafa04c0bbf039ee7d02f1d02/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p>Mia Love, the former Black Utah Republican congresswoman, said Green’s hopes to lead such an effort could meet resistance if elected. “What she thinks and what the reality she is going to find are vastly different, because there are people that are in Washington who have seniority and committees that will lead on those issues, when in reality, she might be the right messenger,” Love said.</p> <p>I asked Green what she makes of Christian nationalism, the newly ascendant ideology in the Republican Party. “I think sometimes when we talk about the Christian nationalism movement, we forget that concept of love,” Green said. “It doesn’t allow us to have the opportunity to respect other people or other people’s decisions. And so I do respect the fact that we were founded as a Christian nation, but Christianity is all about loving people.

I feel more calm,” she said, as she banked the plane east, making a big circle over the airport. She wore a black and green Jennifer-Ruth Green for Congress polo, a jean skirt, and black and white Chuck Taylor All-Star low tops. She was unwinding from a long day on the campaign trail, with no destination in particular — a rare moment for a hard-charging candidate.\n Flying is key to Green’s still-evolving political brand. In one ad, she stands in front of a plane, wearing a green civilian flight suit with Civil Air Patrol and Tuskegee Airmen badges sewn on. “I’m not just a pilot,” she says, “or a combat veteran. I’m Jennifer-Ruth Green.” In another ad, she poses in front of a fighter jet with the at-risk kids she mentors in her faith-based, non-profit organization, MissionAero, aimed at introducing youth to careers in the aerospace industry.\n The sun dipped in the sky. Green looked out of the pilot-side window and pointed to the steel mills that dotted the landscape of this corner of Northwest Indiana, farmland, and the Chicago skyline beyond on the western border of her district’s boundaries. The district includes U.S. Steel’s Gary Works, the largest steel mill in the nation, situated in Gary, a hollowed-out Rust Belt city. Economic refugees who have fled Illinois seeking Indiana’s friendlier tax climate have made this district more competitive in recent cycles, she said.\n “It’s such an incredibly diverse district,” said Green, who identifies as Black and Asian. “The majority of the district is blue-collar workers who take care of their bills and take care of their families — the middle 80 percent of the country. You don’t have granola bars or tree huggers. Everybody sits in this happy middle.”\n   \n The political mood on the ground might not be quite as cheerful. There’s an unexpected amount of drama for a district that hasn’t voted for a Republican in 92 years. Green, 40, is locked in one of the nation’s most competitive congressional races against freshman Democratic incumbent Rep. Frank Mrvan. POLITICO rates the race as leaning Democratic. But Green has made it competitive by posting record fundraising numbers — she raised $1.3 million in the third quarter, which positions her to likely outraise Mrvan for the second straight quarter. It’s not just her unique story that has made her a formidable challenger, but the ways and places in which she tells it: She’s become something of a regular on Fox News, a Black messenger who is a useful soldier in the culture wars for Republicans.\n “I wholeheartedly disagree that every system is inherently racist,” she said of critical race theory on Fox & Friends in July, “because if it were, I would not have had the opportunity of becoming a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and the Indiana National Guard … And so I’m exhibit A, and a rejection of the notion that CRT is a thought process that is worth continuing to provide to our K-12 children.”\n Green stands out even in a year when a historic group of 133 Black women are vying for spots in the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the 26 Black women in Congress, all are Democrats. Of the Republicans running in the 47 most vulnerable Democratic districts, 38 percent are military veterans, according to the Cook Political Report. Thirty-four percent are women. Twenty-three percent are non-white. Seventy percent are at least one of those things. Green is all three, just one of two candidates on the ballot this November to hold such a distinction. (Anna Paulina Luna, a fellow Air Force vet, who is Hispanic, is running in Florida’s 13th District.)\n Green recognizes the rarity of being a Black woman and conservative — something she recalls having an awareness of early in life. “There was a point I remember thinking that it was us, the Powells and the Rices who were the only Black Republicans in the country,” she said, referring to the two former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. When she announced her congressional bid last year, many friends and students who take flight lessons from her expressed “consternation” about her party affiliation.\n \n  \n She does not sound like a Powell or Rice, though. She has decried what she calls “woke madness” and equated abortion to eugenics against Black people, tweeting that “more Black babies are aborted than born in New York City.” In the wake of Dobbs, her position on abortion is going to make it harder for her to close the gap on Mrvan. Hoosier and national Democrats have hammered her anti-abortion rights stance, and her campaign privately fears the court’s decision could keep the district out of reach for Republicans.\n Now, starting her descent back to the Griffith airfield, Green refocused on the flight plan. “Take off and landing are the most accident-prone times,” she said.\n A month out until the election, Green is readying for her political landing. The Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund has booked $2.85 million in ads through Election Day. The Democratic House Majority PAC, meanwhile, has spent or booked a total of $2.56 million to attack Green. Green’s been in a war zone before.\n “Like butter,” she said, as she eased the plane down in the summer heat.\n Jennifer-Ruth Green Reports for Duty\n A self-described “military brat” in a family of six, Green grew up in Long Beach, California and Sacramento where her father, an Air Force senior master sergeant, was stationed.\n Her father studied Russian, and her mother, a native of the Philippines who spoke Tagalog, wanted their children to learn another language but couldn’t find a Russian school in the area, Green said. “So four of us went to Japanese school” — every Saturday, from second to 10th grade. Later, she would pick up Spanish, French and Tagalog.\n When she was in kindergarten, her mother went back into the medical field, and so her father watched her after school. “We’d come home and we’d have two hours and it would be either 30 minutes of rest, 30 minutes of piano practice, 30 minutes of chores, 30 minutes of just reading,” Green said. “And then after that, we could all have dinner” — but while giving a 5-minute brief of whatever they had just read. Whoever won pocketed a dollar bill.\n Green attended the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in 2005 as one of just 15 Black female cadets in a class of 919. Her intention was to become a pilot but she didn’t pass her flight training, according to military records, and transferred into special investigations, which “identifies, investigates and neutralizes criminal, terrorist and espionage threats.” By 2009, she was a captain stationed in Iraq, part of a unit responsible for turning over the provisional government to the Iraqis. “It was a treacherous time,” she said.\n Her job, in part, was to conduct site visits at the national training center, Iraq’s FBI equivalent, evaluating their facilities and law enforcement curriculum. Her military evaluations praised her for evaluating 24 Iraqi intel course syllabi, something that expedited “curriculum development by months” and “professionalized agent training.” She “personally advised [the] Iraqi equivalent of [the] FBI Academy Director,” according to military records obtained by POLITICO.\n \n  \n Green’s mostly stellar military record took an unexpected hit in early 2010, according to military records. In an evaluation of her performance spanning from March 15, 2009 to Dec. 15, 2009, she received a “does not meet standards” rating in leadership skills, professional qualities, and judgment and decisions. The evaluation centered on “two instances of lacking judgment while deployed; handling your weapon and wandering away while at a [forward operating base].”\n In the first case, she was given a letter of counseling for loading her weapon inside a military facility. The second more serious incident occurred in September, according to her military records, when she and a small group of officers visited the national training center. She left the group to climb into a cramped guard tower where Green says an Iraqi serviceman sexually assaulted her by grabbing her breast and exposing himself.\n She said she was advised not to report the assault by a staff sergeant, who was also a military equal opportunity representative. He told her that “if American leadership complained to Iraqi leadership, they would continue to see women as liabilities and limit their ability to serve … .”\n The poor evaluation, which was performed by someone who was not in Iraq with Green, affected her ability to rise in the ranks and in 2012 she was removed from active duty as part of a larger force reduction, according to her records. Green has appealed the evaluation, citing supporting letters from her superiors stationed in Iraq. Her direct supervisor, a senior agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, wrote in her appeal that she “did an outstanding job in her duties; I did not question her leadership, judgment or professional skills.”\n In 2017, she joined the Indiana Air National Guard. She now serves as a lieutenant colonel and commander and chief information officer. She has received consistently high evaluations.\n “I’m a survivor of sexual trauma in the military, and I am being forced to discuss it publicly for the first time because Congressman Mrvan or his supporters obtained — either illegally or by egregious error — military records describing my sexual assault as well as performance reviews, and peddled those records to the media with the intent smear me and my military career,” she wrote in a statement to POLITICO. “The performance review being pushed to discredit my leadership is false.” (Green has not contested the authenticity of the documents, which were obtained by a public records request and provided to POLITICO by a person outside the Mrvan campaign.)\n “After reporting my assault against the advice of officials in my command, my career was intentionally derailed. I appealed the findings with the military and the issue is settled. I have unquestionably progressed as a military member, promoting to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and successfully completed a command tour,” Green wrote in her statement to POLITICO. “As I have always, I will move forward and succeed despite obstacles such as this thrown in my path.”\n A Department of the Air Force spokesperson said: “We remain committed to building a culture of respect, where sexual assault and harassment are not tolerated in any form and we will do this by supporting victims and prosecuting offenders through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.”\n \n Jennifer-Ruth Green Watches the State of the Union\n Green settled in to watch the State of the Union in February 2020 on her couch. She watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tear up the pages of the president’s address.\n “It was a visceral gut reaction. I just felt sick to my stomach,” Green said. Not long after, the political novice decided to run for Congress.\n “The third most powerful person in the country, knew that for her to have applause, and to have people write a headline about her was more important than making sure that our adversaries didn’t see instability, just led me to believe that there’s a great failure there,” she said.\n I asked her if what happened a year later on Jan. 6 was perhaps more egregious in terms of demonstrating instability to our enemies.\n “I would say they would feel that it would be a source of instability as well,” Green said, though with notably less enthusiasm.\n \n  \n Green entered early into what would become a crowded primary field.\n In May, Green won her seven-way primary by figuratively hugging Donald Trump, and criticizing her most prominent opponent, Blair Milo, for not attending the 2016 Republican Convention. Milo, the former mayor of LaPorte and a Navy veteran, was the only person in the field who had previously won elected office. In one ad she called Milo a “Never-Trump Liberal,” criticizing her for having reservations about attending the GOP convention in 2016. Now, Green is distancing herself from Trump. “President Trump was just very, very vocal in his style of leadership,” Green says now. “And his personality was not something that I want to emulate.”\n Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, former ambassador to the United Nations and potential presidential 2024 candidate, arrived in town recently to fundraise for Green, netting her another $20,000 or so as she continues to outraise her Democratic challenger. A few weeks earlier, Green pumped discounted gas alongside former Vice President Mike Pence. The last Republican who ran in this district spent only $14,000 and lost by 16 points. Green racked up more than that in one event, a signal that she is a different kind of GOP candidate.\n Jennifer-Ruth Green in Brazil\n “I’m going to pray for dinner,” Green said, a bacon, cheese and potato omelette and Coke before her at Mi Tierra, a Mexican restaurant at the airport in Griffith. “Dear Lord, thank you very much for this food. Thank you very much for the safety. God, I ask that this food would be blessed to our bodies and help us get back safely to our homes tonight.”\n Green’s favorite character is Barnabas, a “minister of missionaries,” she says, who helped the Apostle Paul spread the Gospel. She was inspired to get her pilot’s instructor certification in 2015 while on a mission trip in Brazil, where there was a need for pilots to fly into the Amazon.\n Green sees herself as a political missionary, a cultural translator who can bridge the divide between Republicans and minority communities on issues like the social safety net.\n “I think when we talk about welfare programs, we just can’t have people who get a job and then all of a sudden you’re cut off entirely,” Green said. “That’s just not an incentive and it’s more debilitating than it is helpful.” On this issue, Green presents herself as a moderate Republican — making her a better fit for a Democratic district.\n \n  \n Mia Love, the former Black Utah Republican congresswoman, said Green’s hopes to lead such an effort could meet resistance if elected. “What she thinks and what the reality she is going to find are vastly different, because there are people that are in Washington who have seniority and committees that will lead on those issues, when in reality, she might be the right messenger,” Love said.\n I asked Green what she makes of Christian nationalism, the newly ascendant ideology in the Republican Party. “I think sometimes when we talk about the Christian nationalism movement, we forget that concept of love,” Green said. “It doesn’t allow us to have the opportunity to respect other people or other people’s decisions. And so I do respect the fact that we were founded as a Christian nation, but Christianity is all about loving people. And so I want to bring that back.”\n Jennifer-Ruth Green Plays Defense\n Down the homestretch of the race, Democrats are trying to paint Green as an extremist on abortion, running an ad highlighting her no-exceptions stance — “Not even if a woman’s life is at risk. Not even if she is raped. Not even if the victim is a 10-year-old little girl,” the narrator says. The ad refers to the horrific and headline-grabbing case of an Ohio native forced to cross the state line to receive an abortion in Indiana after the Dobbs ruling. It’s a case that imbued the Indiana’s legislative session — the first one convened in a special session following the court’s overturning of Roe — with a tense emotional energy.\n On this day, Indiana’s new abortion law, among the most restrictive in the nation — with narrow exceptions for rape and incest through 10 weeks — took effect. “I support the legislation,” Green said. “I’m pro-life and I believe that people can disagree on this issue. At the national level, the federal level, I would wholeheartedly support a 15-week ban, late-term abortion ban with exceptions of life of the mother, rape and incest.” In other words, she endorses Lindsey Graham’s abortion ban proposal, which comes as she’s getting hammered in this traditionally Democratic district over her anti-abortion stance.\n \n  \n And what did she make of the 10-year-old’s case? “That’s a really difficult situation. I feel very bad for victims of sexual assault,” Green said. “My heart grieves for that. And I think, you know, Indiana has exceptions for those kinds of cases.”\n Green isn’t conceding political defeat and insists all the pressure is on her opponent Mrvan.\n “The military has taught me that I value good ideas,” Green said. “So I don’t care where they come from. And at the end of the day, if they just say, ‘Jennifer is a thoughtful leader of character,’ then I’ll be happy with that.”","dc:creator":"Adam Wren","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/39/46/7aa2ffc34ecba29646683b134d5b/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary2.jpg"},"media:title":[{"_":"Jennifer-Ruth Green stands on top of her airplane for a portrait at the Griffith-Merrillville Airport in Griffith, Ind. on Sept. 15, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/39/46/7aa2ffc34ecba29646683b134d5b/mag.Wren.JenniferRuthGreen-Secondary2.jpg"}}]},"content":"This Black conservative woman has a shot to flip a seat in Indiana that has voted Democratic for nearly a century.","contentSnippet":"This Black conservative woman has a shot to flip a seat in Indiana that has voted Democratic for nearly a century.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/07/shes-black-and-conservative-in-a-democratic-district-is-she-about-to-take-off-politically-00060703","isoDate":"2022-10-07T12:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"Utility begins loading fuel at new Georgia nuclear plant","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/utility-begins-loading-fuel-georgia-140034748.html","pubDate":"2022-10-14T14:00:34Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2J1NWqN6rqCg45XMcZNtbg--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/aec76f51e8f4f2857468dfa269777e74","width":"130"}},"guid":"utility-begins-loading-fuel-georgia-140034748.html","isoDate":"2022-10-14T14:00:34.000Z"},{"title":"What to do with your old phones, gadgets and other e-waste","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/tech/e-waste-tips/index.html","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 12:40:04 GMT","content":"In the past two months, Apple, Google and Samsung have all unveiled their newest smartphones and other devices with the goal of getting consumers to upgrade ahead of the holidays.

Will It Backfire?","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/14/republicans-laws-think-tanks-00061763","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 03:30:00 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a0/e6/754e36ab4aa596ac55432adc896e/gettyimages-464381378.jpg\"> <br> <p>When the president of the Brookings Institution stepped down last summer amid a federal probe into whether he had illegally lobbied on behalf of Qatar, the news elicited a certain schadenfreude among think-tankers to the right of the august Washington research outfit.</p> <p>But now, three months after the Qatar controversy rocked Brookings, the uproar has sparked a new wave of Congressional scrutiny and proposed legislation — driven largely but not exclusively by conservatives — that could ultimately complicate life at the same right-leaning institutions where people giggled at John Allen’s dramatic fall from grace.</p> <p>That’s because the Capitol Hill reaction to the allegations about Allen and Qatar has been a spate of calls to have the government mandate various sorts of disclosures by think tanks dealing with the often uncomfortable question of where they get their funding and whether they tailor their supposedly research-based conclusions to the tastes of the folks writing the checks.</p> <p>“Congress, the executive branch, and the American people deserve to know who’s influencing research and public policy in our country,” is how Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a co-sponsor of the most stringent recent proposal, put it.</p> <p>Yet while the proximate controversy, and the subject of Grassley’s bill, involve money from foreign sources, the logic of the criticism is that think tanks have an outsize effect on public policy and the public is therefore entitled to know who’s calling the shots. It’s a logic that doesn’t necessarily stop at the water’s edge.</p> <p>Consider the highest-profile left-wing critic of Brookings, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose broadsides against nefarious foreign funders often elide into broadsides against nefarious domestic donors: “Special interest money slithers through Washington like a snake, and for years I’ve been sounding the alarm about corporations and foreign governments secretly using think tanks to lobby,” Warren said in a statement. Her own bill, which predates the Allen tumult, would require think tanks to disclose donors — not just foreign ones — that pay for lobbying materials, among other things.</p> <p>For all the joy that conservative pols have taken at Brookings’ latest turn in the barrel, conversations with people around the industry reveal an irony: Any potential new wave of government-mandated disclosure rules, especially those that go beyond foreign money, would actually represent a bigger cultural change at right-wing organizations, some of which historically have tended to see donations as a form of free speech. Establishmentarian center-left outfits like Brookings already share significant pieces of that information — thanks in part, it should be noted, to previous funding imbroglios, and their reliance on corporate dollars. (The Heritage Foundation, by contrast, says less than two percent of its income comes from corporate sources.)<br></p> <br> <p>The last spate of transparency efforts, which followed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/us/politics/think-tanks-research-and-corporate-lobbying.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665695046732,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665695046732,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/us/politics/think-tanks-research-and-corporate-lobbying.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-d329-d425-a58b-d7e9503d000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;blockbuster set&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-d329-d425-a58b-d7e9503d000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">blockbuster set</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1665695060207,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1665695060207,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-d329-d231-abc3-d7fb848e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>New York Times</i> reports&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-d329-d231-abc3-d7fb848e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>New York Times</i> reports</a> in 2014 and 2016 about donor influence at think tanks, was embraced “way more on the left than the right,” one longtime conservative think tank figure tells me. (To be clear, this veteran of fundraising told me, that’s because it was centrist and liberal outfits that had been caught out.) While a visitor to Brookings’ website can today peruse annual reports that identify top donors, the American Enterprise Institute says it doesn’t provide that information as a matter of course.</p> <p>“It’s going to be a harder, bigger disruptor for center-right think tanks,” even though more of them say they don’t take foreign government money, says Enrique Mendizabal, who leads On Think Tanks, a research outfit that researches the think tank business.</p> <p>It’s also notable that none of the proposals that have been publicized since the tumult at Brookings would have done much about Allen, whose allegedly fishy work for Qatar was done before he took over Brookings and would theoretically be covered by the Foreign Agent Registration Act. (He’s denied improper behavior and hasn’t been charged with any wrongdoing.)</p> <p>What the scrutiny of Allen did do, though, was re-focus attention on the organization’s broader history with the emirate.

These think tanks are creating problems for themselves by claiming to be so influential. It’s as if Congress has no agency — they’re saying we need to be protected from these influential organizations that we’re powerless against and that use foreign money.”<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"When the president of the Brookings Institution stepped down last summer amid a federal probe into whether he had illegally lobbied on behalf of Qatar, the news elicited a certain schadenfreude among think-tankers to the right of the august Washington research outfit.\n But now, three months after the Qatar controversy rocked Brookings, the uproar has sparked a new wave of Congressional scrutiny and proposed legislation — driven largely but not exclusively by conservatives — that could ultimately complicate life at the same right-leaning institutions where people giggled at John Allen’s dramatic fall from grace.\n That’s because the Capitol Hill reaction to the allegations about Allen and Qatar has been a spate of calls to have the government mandate various sorts of disclosures by think tanks dealing with the often uncomfortable question of where they get their funding and whether they tailor their supposedly research-based conclusions to the tastes of the folks writing the checks.\n “Congress, the executive branch, and the American people deserve to know who’s influencing research and public policy in our country,” is how Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a co-sponsor of the most stringent recent proposal, put it.\n Yet while the proximate controversy, and the subject of Grassley’s bill, involve money from foreign sources, the logic of the criticism is that think tanks have an outsize effect on public policy and the public is therefore entitled to know who’s calling the shots. It’s a logic that doesn’t necessarily stop at the water’s edge.\n Consider the highest-profile left-wing critic of Brookings, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose broadsides against nefarious foreign funders often elide into broadsides against nefarious domestic donors: “Special interest money slithers through Washington like a snake, and for years I’ve been sounding the alarm about corporations and foreign governments secretly using think tanks to lobby,” Warren said in a statement. Her own bill, which predates the Allen tumult, would require think tanks to disclose donors — not just foreign ones — that pay for lobbying materials, among other things.\n For all the joy that conservative pols have taken at Brookings’ latest turn in the barrel, conversations with people around the industry reveal an irony: Any potential new wave of government-mandated disclosure rules, especially those that go beyond foreign money, would actually represent a bigger cultural change at right-wing organizations, some of which historically have tended to see donations as a form of free speech. Establishmentarian center-left outfits like Brookings already share significant pieces of that information — thanks in part, it should be noted, to previous funding imbroglios, and their reliance on corporate dollars. (The Heritage Foundation, by contrast, says less than two percent of its income comes from corporate sources.)\n \n The last spate of transparency efforts, which followed a blockbuster set of New York Times reports\",\"_id\":\"00000183-d329-d231-abc3-d7fb848e0000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">New York Times reports in 2014 and 2016 about donor influence at think tanks, was embraced “way more on the left than the right,” one longtime conservative think tank figure tells me. (To be clear, this veteran of fundraising told me, that’s because it was centrist and liberal outfits that had been caught out.) While a visitor to Brookings’ website can today peruse annual reports that identify top donors, the American Enterprise Institute says it doesn’t provide that information as a matter of course.\n “It’s going to be a harder, bigger disruptor for center-right think tanks,” even though more of them say they don’t take foreign government money, says Enrique Mendizabal, who leads On Think Tanks, a research outfit that researches the think tank business.\n It’s also notable that none of the proposals that have been publicized since the tumult at Brookings would have done much about Allen, whose allegedly fishy work for Qatar was done before he took over Brookings and would theoretically be covered by the Foreign Agent Registration Act. (He’s denied improper behavior and hasn’t been charged with any wrongdoing.)\n What the scrutiny of Allen did do, though, was re-focus attention on the organization’s broader history with the emirate. In June, I reported on a 2007 contract with the Qatari government establishing a Brookings outpost in Doha while handing its autocratic regime an unusual and unattractive degree of contractual prerogatives over an independent organization. The previously unreported contract has been cited by members of Congress supporting new disclosure rules and demanding federal investigations. (In a final irony, it was during Allen’s tenure that Brookings actually disaffiliated from its Doha center and began eschewing funding from non-democratic governments.)\n That Qatar deal wound up in angry public letters by Warren as well as a quartet of GOP senators, and in the most stringent of the bills introduced following Allen’s departure, the Think Tank Transparency Act, sponsored by Grassley and Michigan GOP Rep. Jack Bergman.\n Not only does their measure require the quick disclosure of all funding from foreign sources, including private citizens, it also orders think tanks to share the contracts so that the public would know, as in the case of Brookings’ Doha center, whether management had agreed to submit a budget and program agenda to a government ministry. And it says any briefings for Congress or the executive branch funded by the foreign donation be labeled as such. The prospect of having to announce the support of the government of Qatar or Norway on every paper prepared for a federal policymaker is something that fills a lot of think-tankers with dread.\n Under the bill, the rules apply to nonprofits that spent at least 20 percent of resources influencing public policy, which is how it avoids looping in art museums or cancer-research facilities or other nonprofits. Technically, there’s no legal definition of “think tank.”\n Another measure, the Fighting Foreign Influence Act, with bipartisan sponsorship that includes Democratic Reps. Jared Golden (Maine) and Katie Porter (Calif.) as well as the far-right Republican Rep. Paul Gosar (Ariz.), would require think tanks to declare any funding from foreign governments and political parties, which would then be published by the Treasury Department.\n “None of this would have happened if not for John Allen,” says Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and a longstanding critic of think tanks as a place where foreign entities can skirt FARA rules and have a real impact on American policy and public opinion.

Only two senators physically attended, and a big question hung over the proceedings: Will Biden's party have two more months to approve his judges — or two more years?\n For more than 20 months now, Democrats have OK'd their judicial nominees with almost no obstacles and kept pace with President Donald Trump’s big confirmation numbers, despite holding the narrowest Senate majority possible. But as they confront the potential loss of unified government control and prepare for legislative gridlock to resume between the House and Senate next year, continued sway over Biden's nominations may be Democrats' most tangible asset should they hang on to the upper chamber. \n And it’s not hard to distill the political stakes of holding on to the Senate's confirmation power, given recent history.\n “We have something like 80 federal vacancies — more coming. To leave those judicial seats vacant is to really challenge the Republican message in this campaign that they’re all for law and order,\" Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in an interview Wednesday. \"You can't have law and order with an empty bench and no judge.\"\n If Republicans win the Senate, Mitch McConnell would become majority leader and might slow confirmations to a trickle, just as he did under President Barack Obama. But if Majority Leader Chuck Schumer holds on, two more years of a Democratic chamber would essentially guarantee that Biden can keep pace with Trump’s judicial totals and bend some circuit and district courts back to the left, not to mention fill a Supreme Court vacancy if one opens up. \n \n \n McConnell is already sending a warning signal. \n \"For the last two years, the Democrat-run Senate has been more of a rubber stamp than an equal partner on judicial nominations,\" the minority leader said in a statement for this story. \"I expect that to change if Republicans are in the majority next year.\"\n With the longest evenly divided Senate still going, Biden and Schumer have already set a torrid judicial appointment pace, basically tying Trump and McConnell’s first two years controlling the machinery at 84 total lifetime judicial confirmations, albeit one less Supreme Court justice. Biden was leading Trump's clip handily until this week, in fact; Senate Democrats signed off on confirming more than a dozen of Trump's lifetime judicial appointments right before the 2018 midterms.\n Next month's election results will determine whether Biden and Schumer can finish their work or whether McConnell is able to return to his strategy from Obama's latter years in office, dramatically slowing Biden’s confirmation rate and setting the table for a potential GOP presidential win in 2024.\n “The stakes are so critical. There’s no exaggerating how important they are, because President Biden needs to continue nominating distinguished and diverse judicial appointees,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “He will be greatly hamstrung if Republicans are obstructing.”\n Republicans are mostly circumspect about how they might treat Biden’s nominees with the battle for the Senate so hotly contested. Earlier this year the No. 3 GOP leader, Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, said of future vacancies: “My goal is to take the majority. We’ll take a look at that. We need to get the majority.”\n Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who would probably chair the Judiciary panel if the GOP wins the Senate, said in a statement that \"under a Republican majority, nominees will receive more thorough scrutiny than they have been for the last two years.” Grassley declined even a hearing for Obama's Supreme Court nominee, now-Attorney General Merrick Garland, in 2016.\n \n \n As majority leader in 2015 and 2016, McConnell confirmed just 20 of Obama’s district and appellate court nominees while leaving Garland off the bench. That’s by far the lowest two-year confirmation total since Jimmy Carter was president, according to the Congressional Research Service. \",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45622\",\"_id\":\"00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf59360000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf59360001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">according to the Congressional Research Service. \n Confirming judicial nominees would “be very difficult” in a Republican Senate, said Sen.

Donald Trump, in the words of Vice Chair Liz Cheney, had a “premeditated plan to declare the election was fraudulent and stolen before Election Day”; he knew he had lost and fed his base endless lies about it; he welcomed a siege of the Capitol and did nothing to stop it. And because, in Cheney’s words, the “cause of Jan. 6th was one man… his state of mind, his intent, his motivations…,” his testimony was required.\n With that, the committee unanimously voted to subpoena the former president, ensuring the day’s headline news.\n It is almost surely a symbolic act. The odds that Trump will enthusiastically appear to make his case is roughly equivalent to Herschel Walker’s admittance into Mensa, and the committee’s writ will expire by year’s end, long before a court fight over the subpoena would be resolved.

Huddled with his team in the impeachment managers’ holding room after the Senate trial proceedings had finished on Friday evening, the Maryland Democrat was stunned at the revelations: A moderate House Republican whom Raskin had never met was claiming to have firsthand evidence that Trump had sided with the mob on Jan. 6.</p> <p>It was Feb. 12, 2021, and Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington had told CNN that Kevin McCarthy had confided he had spoken with the president during the insurrection. McCarthy, she said, told her Trump had flatly refused McCarthy’s plea for help despite knowing how chaotic and horrific the Capitol attack had been. In her notes, she had scribbled down one particularly damning utterance from the former president. “Well, Kevin,” McCarthy had recounted Trump as saying, “I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”</p> <p>Raskin, the lead manager in Trump’s second impeachment, gaped at the quote. “How can anybody hear this news and not convict him?!” he exclaimed.</p> <p>The story’s revelations only got more staggering. Other Republicans had also confirmed hearing about the McCarthy-Trump exchange. One even told CNN that Trump, despite his claims of innocence, was “not a blameless observer. He was rooting for them.”</p> <p>But Herrera Beutler had stuck out her neck furthest of all by describing Trump’s selfish nonchalance that day. “That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn’t care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry,” she told CNN. “We should never stand for that, for any reason, under any party flag.”</p> <p><i>Who was this woman?</i> Raskin wanted to know. She had been among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. But his familiarity with her began and ended there. Whatever her story, Raskin knew one thing: This other Jaime was about to become his best friend.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/bd/05/89c56e624e14b33c077e7f518892/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.jhb.jpg\"> <br> <p>The story was dynamite, Raskin thought, and could blow up the last of the Trump team’s slipshod defense. Just a few hours earlier, the president’s counsel Michael van der Veen had argued — weakly — that Trump tried to protect his vice president from the hordes of rioters calling for his head. “I’m sure Mr. Trump very much is concerned and was concerned for the safety and well-being of Mr. Pence and everybody else that was over here,” he had said. It was a flimsy conjecture that everyone knew was a lie — and here was the proof.</p> <p>“We should try to reach out to this Jaime Herrera Beutler and get her notes,” Raskin told the managers in their prep room.</p> <p>“I know Jaime really well,” Diana DeGette of Colorado piped up, offering to be the go-between.</p> <p>“Try her and see if other House Republicans know about this call too,” Raskin instructed.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler’s revelations complicated an already frenzied Friday night. The managers had been caught flat-footed. When Trump’s lawyers had rested their case after just a couple of hours, setting up closing arguments for Saturday morning. The managers hadn’t expected to give their closing statements until Sunday or Monday and hadn’t yet written a word of them. Even before the CNN story landed, they were staring down another all-nighter in a week where they had barely slept.</p> <p>Raskin instructed anyone who wasn’t responsible for delivering final arguments to go home and get some rest. But as the managers started collecting their belongings, one of them, Eric Swalwell, posed a question to the room.</p> <p>“Hasn’t this CNN story changed things?” the California Democrat asked, pointing out that in much of that afternoon’s Q&amp;A session, GOP senators had asked what Trump knew and didn’t know about the violence. The report, he argued, was an opportunity to give them answers in real time.</p> <p>“Shouldn’t we be calling for witnesses now?” Swalwell asked.</p> <p>Raskin paused. Swalwell had a point. But it was too massive a change in strategy to make a hasty decision.</p> <p>“We aren’t going to talk about witnesses now,” he said. “I’ll be in touch.”</p> <p>For weeks, Raskin had engaged in a top secret search for a firsthand witness from the president’s inner circle who could add something valuable to the narrative. His team had even privately sparred with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s team about leaving open the possibility of calling for new testimony — a move that ran counter to the New York Democrat’s eagerness for a quick trial so the party could move on to confirming President Joe Biden’s nominees. When none of their leads volunteered to come forward, Raskin had shrugged it off, projecting confidence that witnesses weren’t necessary to win. But Herrera Beutler’s account was making him rethink his decision. <i>How could they refuse to have her explain her bombshell story?</i></p> <p>In the year-and-a-half-long saga of the two impeachments of Donald Trump, few moments better exemplify the susceptibility of impeachment to the political whims of Congress as the last, frantic 24 hours of Trump’s second trial. The absence of key firsthand accounts had created a major roadblock to conviction in Trump’s first impeachment. House Democrats had chosen to avoid pursuing witnesses to get the politically fraught effort over with as soon as possible, but that had cost them support among several moderate House and Senate Republicans who privately had been open to conviction. In the end, that first failed effort boosted the president’s popularity, emboldening rather than constraining him. But more than 250 interviews with key players in both parties would reveal that the same political calculations made on both sides of the aisle that ended up hobbling the first impeachment would also cripple the second. Republicans who had stuck their necks out to impeach Trump after Jan. 6 would hide in fear of political retaliation rather than help the managers in their effort to convict the former president. And Raskin and his team would learn to their dismay that their own party could prove equally obstructionist when it suited their political purposes.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9a/e6/d3e2f4a8434d87cae4ff85ad89b5/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.doors.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9c/ec/1382e1a4405f8257bbf6c2ac5c9f/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-01.png\"> <br> <p><b>About an hour later, </b>DeGette poked her head back in the room with a double whammy of bad news. Herrera Beutler’s cell had gone straight to voicemail. DeGette had sent a text asking to talk, but the Washington Republican still hadn’t responded. And DeGette’s efforts to find other Republicans aware of the McCarthy-Trump conversation had also come up short. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) of Michigan, one of the 10 GOP impeachers, told her that only Herrera Beutler had heard McCarthy’s tale, though the GOP leader had indeed conveyed the account to multiple people. That limited the number of people who could confirm the report to one, she conveyed to the team.</p> <p>At 9:30 p.m., just as Raskin and the rest of the managers were about to head home, signs of life from Herrera Beutler gave them new hope. She texted DeGette that she was on the West Coast with her children but would be in touch soon, inquiring about the managers’ timeline. DeGette told her they would resume the trial at 10 a.m. the next morning and to call her ASAP, indicating that they’d be interested in seeing her notes about McCarthy’s call. <i>Maybe she’ll cooperate after all</i>, Raskin thought as he departed the Capitol.</p> <p>Raskin was up late that night, waiting for smoke signals from Herrera Beutler, when team attorney Barry Berke called with more encouraging news. Swalwell had texted Congressman Greg Pence (R-Ind.) that night to inquire if his brother, the former vice president, would be willing to sit for a deposition. Pence had responded by texting back a shrug emoji — which as Swalwell read it, wasn’t saying no. Swalwell had then reached out to Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), another of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, who had also been in close contact with Pence world throughout the trial and whose wife was a former Pence staffer. Kinzinger told him that the vice president’s team was furious at Trump’s lawyers for suggesting the president had cared about Pence’s safety on Jan. 6 when he hadn’t checked on him once during the riot. He suggested the vice president might actually allow his team to testify to set the record straight and advised Swalwell to contact Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, who had been with him through the riot. Kinzinger gave Swalwell Short’s cell phone number, and Swalwell fired off a text.</p> <p>“We would like to receive your testimony about January 6 in any manner you were comfortable,” Swalwell wrote, after introducing himself to Short. The managers, he continued, would be willing to conduct a deposition behind closed doors, eschew cameras, and even stick to subjects Short was comfortable with. Anything to get his cooperation.</p> <p>“We are also able to provide a subpoena if that makes it easier to do so,” Swalwell offered. “Anything you can add would be helpful . . .We have to know soon as this may wrap tomorrow if we don’t have a witness.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/d0/70/00b6badf4915900a41ceea556bcc/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.pence.jpg\"> <br> <p>Then, Swalwell called Berke to give him an update.</p> <p>As Berke recounted Swalwell’s efforts to Raskin, he added that he had also enlisted the managers’ new ally Charles Cooper to help. Right before the trial, the prominent conservative attorney had done them an unexpected favor, penning an op-ed in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> stating the impeachment trial was entirely constitutional — directly contradicting the talking point most Senate Republicans had been rallying around. Berke thought maybe Cooper would assist them in convincing Short to testify. Cooper said he’d reach out to his Pence contacts and report back.</p> <p>As he hung up the phone, Raskin could hardly believe their developing good fortune: The former vice president’s inner circle might be willing to refute Trump’s case! But what about Herrera</p> <p>Beutler? He looked at the clock. It was after 11 p.m. — 8 p.m. on the West Coast — and his team still hadn’t heard back from her. He picked up the phone to try her himself, but her mailbox was full. Desperate, Raskin left a message on her office’s general line, even though it was well after hours on Friday. He crossed his fingers that some staffer would get the message by morning and call him back. In his frustration, Raskin dialed Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) — the No. 3 House Republican who’d been secretly advising him on impeachment for weeks — to vent.</p> <p>“We’re trying our hardest to get in touch with Jaime Herrera Beutler,” he said.</p> <p>“Yeah, she seems to have gone into hiding,” Cheney replied.</p> <p>“I’m trying to get in touch with her,” Raskin said again.</p> <p>“I think she knows that,” Cheney said drily.</p> <p>A few hours later, when Raskin phoned Herrera Beutler again, she had cleared out her crowded voice mailbox. He tried to make himself sound as friendly and welcoming as possible. “We haven’t met yet, but I am a fellow Jamie and I’m eager to talk to you about impeachment,” he said. “Sorry these are arduous circumstances. Please call me back when you can.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c0/ae/26defaf64992a5193581c5d173e9/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.meeting%20section%20breadk.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/d2/f7cc66fb4b71a19d030bcd884d6d/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-03.png\"> <br> <p><b>The Signal chain on Raskin’s phone </b>started exploding around 7:40 the next morning. His managers were unequivocal: They wanted witnesses. Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) sent a link to a <i>New York Daily News</i> story headlined: “Schumer says Senate will call witnesses for Trump’s trial — if impeachment managers want them.” The Senate majority leader is clearly putting this decision solely on us, he wrote. If we don’t call witnesses, we’re going to get massacred for pulling punches if we fail to convict.</p> <p>Swalwell chimed in to agree. Without tipping his hand about his late-night effort to woo Marc Short, he suggested they subpoena the former vice president, his former chief, and even the Secret Service agents who had been with Trump on Jan. 6. If those witnesses challenged their summons in court, Swalwell wrote, “we can ultimately say that we’ve tried.”</p> <p>The rest of the managers piled on. “Can someone explain to me the rationale for not trying to call witnesses?” manager Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) asked in clear frustration. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) joined in, writing that while it may be “uncomfortable for the Senate” to extend the trial, the managers had a duty to take this case all the way.</p> <p>A senior staffer from the impeachment team pushed back and began highlighting all the complications with such a last-minute call.<br></p> <br> <p>The people Swalwell recommended — including Short and Pence — “are likely to be hostile to us,” the staffer wrote. Plus, if they objected and took the matter to court, the legal battle could drag out for weeks or even months, the aide said, echoing — ironically — the same argument Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had made to justify sidestepping court fights for witnesses during Trump’s first impeachment, and which GOP leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later adopted during the trial.</p> <p>As Raskin’s security detail drove him the seven miles of North Capitol Street from his house to Capitol Hill, he quietly digested the frenzied messages dancing across his phone. Herrera Beutler still hadn’t called him back, and in less than two hours he was expected to launch into his closing arguments. But Raskin knew his team was right. The managers had only put one night of effort into securing testimony that could seal the former president’s fate, hardly enough to warrant giving up. Didn’t they have a duty to present the fullest story possible about what Trump had done — if not to secure a conviction, then at least for the history books?<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2c/92/478eee9a4c2daf04a8eb9e28bc5e/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.raskinshadow.jpg\"> <br> <p>When Raskin walked into the managers’ trial anteroom, Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) was staring out the window, whispering the last lines of his closing speech to himself in careful rehearsal. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) was also practicing for what was supposed to be the final moments of the trial. In the center of the room, Raskin’s staff was fighting over what to do. He joined them, knowing the final call would be his to make.</p> <p>The pro-witness camp, led by Berke, argued witnesses could be a powerful tool in convincing the nation — particularly Republican voters — of Trump’s misdeeds. The right witnesses might even change the minds of some GOP senators, he said, earning them enough votes for a conviction. Berke reminded them that Pence’s team had indicated through intermediaries that they might comply with a Senate subpoena. And they had two well-connected Republicans running interference: Cooper was reaching out to Pence’s team as they spoke, and Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had also promised the night before to make a personal appeal to the former vice president and his team, particularly Short.</p> <p>“Let’s start with Herrera Beutler and then see if others like Marc Short feel compelled to testify as well,” Berke proposed. “We have to try. If we don’t, the American people will never forgive us.”</p> <p>But team attorneys Joshua Matz and Aaron Hiller thought upending the trial with a witness Hail Mary was insane. “Once you open the door to witnesses, you destroy the momentum we’ve built — and we’ve already done a bang-up job,” Hiller argued. Plus, it was common knowledge that Pence wanted to run for president in 2024. What if he uses the opportunity to grandstand and curry favor with the base? What if he surprised them by saying the president did nothing wrong?</p> <p>“You want to call witnesses? Which witnesses? We don’t know!” Matz vented, laying out the possible dangers of going down that path. “Are they coming? We don’t know. What will they say? We also don’t know! How long will it take to get their testimony? Also unclear.”<br></p> <br> <p>By Saturday morning, the idea of extending the trial to demand new testimony had caught on. Progressives, including former federal prosecutor-turned-senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, had taken to Twitter to insist Raskin’s team depose McCarthy and the Secret Service. It was becoming clear that if the managers made a play for witnesses, they would have the votes. Raskin nervously checked the time. In less than an hour, everyone — Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Schumer, Biden and the entire watching nation — was expecting him to walk onto the floor and argue that the managers had proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt and then end the trial. But there was nothing stopping him from calling for witnesses instead. The move, Raskin knew, was high-risk but potentially even higher reward. Republican senators had been signaling their keen interest in learning more of what Trump had said and done during those critical hours when the Capitol was under siege. Here was an opportunity to find out.</p> <p>Raskin knew that Democratic Party leaders wouldn’t be happy. They were eager to put impeachment behind them and move on to passing Biden’s agenda. But Raskin had always eschewed the political calculations that habitually guided those in leadership. For him, this wasn’t about political messaging, or the next election, or even how the trial would impact Biden’s planned policy agenda. This was about convincing most Americans that Trump should never hold office again. The lawyer in Raskin cringed at the idea of jumping into the unknown. If they overplayed their hand and things backfired, he knew he would be blamed for having led the managers’ case astray. But the idealist in him, the one who had pleaded so hard with his party’s superiors to chase every investigative lead to hold Trump accountable, could feel the lure of going all in. He just needed one more gut check.</p> <p>Raskin picked up his phone and dialed Cheney, peppering her with a final volley of queries. Would Herrera Beutler be a reliable witness? Were there others who might follow her lead? What did she think about calling witnesses in general? Cheney agreed with the move. Herrera Beutler, she assured Raskin, was an honorable woman who would tell the truth under oath. She would not grandstand. And better yet, she would make a compelling witness. That was all Raskin needed to hear: If Cheney trusted her, then he would as well.</p> <p>Just before 9:40 a.m., with the start of the trial 20 minutes away and still no word from Herrera Beutler, Raskin called the bustling anteroom to attention. Managers and staff dutifully gathered around a coffee table in the center of the room, filling an embroidered couch and chairs set up in a big circle. Once the room quieted, Raskin turned to his lead attorney, whom he knew was the most pro-witness of the bunch.</p> <p>“Barry, what do you think we should do?” he asked.</p> <p>“We don’t have a choice,” Berke responded. “We have to call witnesses.”</p> <p>“Yes, you’re right,” Raskin declared.<br></p> <br> <p>A ripple of excitement spread through the team as managers seconded the decision with sighs of relief and cheers of Absolutely! and Yes! Immediately everyone jumped up to recalibrate their plans. In one corner, Matz, Berke and Hiller began frantically rewriting Raskin’s opening statement for the day. How would Trump’s attorneys react? And how will we respond to that response? No one knew.</p> <p>“Just write something fast!” one attorney shouted as they began scribbling a makeshift script.</p> <p>The other managers, meanwhile, began to plan their next steps. DeGette volunteered to try again to get ahold of Herrera Beutler, whom she’d been trying to reach all morning. Others began plotting when and how they could depose her if she agreed to testify. Would she come back to town today? If not, was a video interview possible? As a staffer informed Schumer’s team of their last-minute change in plans, Raskin made the most important phone call of all. In a dramatic departure from the first impeachment, Pelosi had let Raskin make the day-to-day decisions for the trial, as she promised she would. But this was a big enough shift that the speaker deserved a heads-up, Raskin reasoned. He gave her a chance to object, but he did not ask her permission.</p> <p>“We’ve got to go for this,” he told her. “We’ve got an opening.”</p> <p>“I trust your judgment,” she told Raskin. “It’s up to you.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6a/04/7bdada894be3ab93e9b316022f3a/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.phone.jpg\"> <br> <p>At 10 a.m., a Senate aide appeared at the door. It was time to start. As Raskin headed to the floor, he made a quick call to his Republican friend Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) for the first of what would become a series of last-minute sales pitches to unearth possible witnesses. As one of the 10 who had voted to impeach, Raskin figured Katko knew about this McCarthy tale that Herrera Beutler and the CNN story had exposed.</p> <p>“Are you willing to testify?” Raskin asked Katko as he walked into the chamber.</p> <p>Katko said no. He had heard personally from McCarthy about his Jan. 6 call with Trump, but the New York Republican didn’t mention that and played dumb.</p> <p>“I don’t have any relevant information,” he said. “You need Jaime. She’s all you need.”</p> <p>Katko would later insist for this book that he offered to testify if subpoenaed and he disputes that he told Raskin that Herrera Beutler “is all you need.” Both statements run contrary to the recollections of five members of the managers’ team who were closely following the mad dash for GOP witnesses that day.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a0/3f/ff6309b747ea928ae0b50b78c12c/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.home.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9c/ec/1382e1a4405f8257bbf6c2ac5c9f/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-01.png\"> <br> <p><b>Jaime Herrera Beutler’s cell phone</b> started ringing just after 7 a.m. Pacific time. On the other line, calling from Washington, D.C., one of her aides was in a panic. Raskin had just marched to the Senate floor and shocked the nation by making a pitch to call witnesses as part of a trial — including her. The motion had actually passed, 55 to 45, with almost no debate.</p> <p>“Oh my gosh, you’re being talked about in the middle of this!” the aide told her.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler was dumbfounded. She knew the managers had been trying to get in touch overnight. But neither Raskin nor DeGette had bothered to tell her that they planned to call her as a witness the next morning. A little heads-up would have been nice. Herrera Beutler was with her family that President’s Day weekend, hoping to get some time off the grid after the chaos following the CNN story the day before. She had not even been watching the trial.</p> <p>She flipped the television on. And sure enough, there, in the well of the Senate, Raskin was standing at the podium and citing the statement Herrera Beutler had instructed her staff to release the previous evening as reason to call witnesses. The Senate had no choice but to hear straight from her about “the president’s willful dereliction of duty,” he said.</p> <p>“Awesome,” she said sarcastically.</p> <p>Just a year before, Herrera Beutler had voted against Trump’s first impeachment, citing Democrats’ process fouls she felt could not be overlooked. She had even voted to reelect Trump in 2020 after refusing to back him in 2016. But Herrera Beutler had been deeply disturbed by what happened on Jan. 6. After evacuating in an astronaut-like escape hood from the balcony of the House chamber, where lawmakers had been trapped longest, she barricaded herself in the office of a fellow female Republican. When Trump went on television to praise his followers as “very special” people, she had lost her usual cool. She was so upset, in fact, that she had decided to record a video in her office around nine o’clock that night. In it she implored the nation to come together and reject fear, albeit without naming Trump specifically. Americans, she argued, had died for this democracy, and those rioters were making a sham of those sacrifices. “I had never thought I’d see this day. I felt like we were under siege!” she said. “Every American should be heartbroken. That’s how I felt.”</p> <p>While Herrera Beutler believed Trump had engaged in an impeachable dereliction of duty, she instructed her team to learn exactly what happened at the White House on Jan. 6 before deciding to condemn him. And she pumped her own contacts for info, particularly one well-connected friend: Kevin McCarthy. </p> <p>The details McCarthy disclosed about his call with Trump on the afternoon of the 6th<sup> </sup>had been the deciding factor in Herrera Beutler’s vote. It was clear to her Trump was not only responsible for the violence but had reveled in it. If that didn’t rise to the level of impeachment, she believed, nothing did.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/96/68/270f59824bc1819b89ad7da7f349/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.trumpgrid.jpg\"> <br> <p>Herrera Beutler had known that her vote would jeopardize her standing with Trump supporters in her GOP district. It was why she made a point of being upfront with constituents and explaining her thinking in interviews with local reporters and in town halls, including the details of her talk with McCarthy. So it came as a bit of a surprise when Liz Cheney called her a few days into the impeachment trial with an unusual request: A CNN reporter had heard about McCarthy’s call with Trump and was trying to confirm it, Cheney told her.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler rarely engaged with the national press, but she agreed to be interviewed. The details of McCarthy’s call might prove critical to establishing Trump’s thoughts and motivations. When the story had posted, Herrera Beutler braced for an angry call from McCarthy — but by late Friday night, she still hadn’t heard from him. Instead, it was the Democrats who were leaving frantic messages.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler had a pretty good idea of what they wanted. What good investigator wouldn’t want more information on the McCarthy-Trump phone call? But she felt it was not her story to tell; it was McCarthy’s. What’s more, she knew that there were others who could tell a similar tale. Halfway through the trial, before the CNN story shot Herrera Beutler into the spotlight, she had texted the other GOP impeachers to ask if McCarthy had ever shared the story of his Trump call with any of them. Multiple members on the chain — a support group of sorts they had dubbed “the band of brothers” — responded that he had.<br></p> <br> <p>After the story broke, Herrera Beutler had instructed her team to issue a press release detailing the McCarthy-Trump call. They closed it with a line encouraging anyone who knew anything to step forward, hoping McCarthy would get the message. “To the patriots who were standing next to the former president as these conversations were happening, or even to the former vice president: If you have something to add here, now would be the time,” it read.</p> <p>She then turned her attention back to her family. But on Saturday morning, thanks to Raskin’s surprise move on the Senate floor, her hopes of having a calm weekend flew out the window.</p> <p>Herrera Beutler considered her options. She could decline to testify and take the easy way out —or she could do the brave thing and agree to tell her story. It was a choice that would come with consequences either way, she thought. But she had come this far already. After bucking her own party with a vote to impeach, what more was a deposition in the Senate?</p> <p>Find me a lawyer, she told her team. She needed professional advice before she took the plunge.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/0e/6a/07893a58441d809c9f43cb5a9a19/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.walking.jpg\"> <br> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/d2/f7cc66fb4b71a19d030bcd884d6d/section-breaks-bade-trump-impeach-03.png\"> <br> <p><b>As soon as the motion to call</b> witnesses passed, Schumer called for an emergency recess and Raskin and his team retreated to their holding room. They were awash with adrenaline, but also struck with terror. They had succeeded in upending the trial completely — and they had no idea what to do next.</p> <p>Huddled in a corner with Berke and Matz, Raskin began furiously calling sympathetic Republicans to see if any would come forward. He dialed Herrera Beutler again. Still no answer. He left a message. Then he tried Katko again. That too went to voicemail. Steve Womack of Arkansas, a sympathetic GOP lawmaker repulsed by Trump, did pick up the phone. Did he know about the Herrera Beutler story? Did he know anything else that could help them? Raskin asked. Or did he know anyone who did know something — anything? Womack said he did not. Ditto with Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), another House Republican who had voted to impeach and sounded physically pained when Raskin introduced himself and asked for assistance.</p> <p>“You should talk to Pence’s people,” Meijer told Raskin, sighing loudly.</p> <p>Upton, the friendly Michigander who had indicated that other moderates would not be able to corroborate Herrera Beutler’s story, wasn’t much help either. When asked if he would be willing to be deposed, Upton declined apologetically and simply wished them luck. He, like Katko, still said nothing about how other moderates had heard the same story from McCarthy as Herrera Beutler.</p> <p>Outside, Washington was in an ecstatic fervor over Raskin’s surprise move. The city had expected Trump’s second impeachment trial to end that afternoon — but now, it seemed, there was a chance the Senate would be in it for the long haul, and possibly hearing firsthand evidence about Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. Progressive Democrats cheered the managers on, encouraging them not to leave a single stone unturned. Trump supporters panicked, decrying Raskin’s move as a sneak attack and threatening revenge.</p> <p>Inside the managers’ room, as Swalwell tried to call Greg Pence, Berke phoned Cooper to see if he’d had any luck finagling permission for Marc Short to testify. Raskin, standing next to him, watched on tenterhooks — and saw his counsel’s face sink. Berke then passed the phone over so Raskin could hear the bad news for himself. Cooper had spoken to Pence’s attorney Richard Cullen: They were not going to cooperate voluntarily. In fact, Pence’s team planned to fight the subpoenas if they were summoned, Cooper said, and had refused to give a preview of what Short might say if called. That meant the managers would have little indication of whether his story was even worth pursuing.</p> <p>“Don’t fuck this up by calling witnesses you might not get,” Cooper told Raskin candidly. “You have a good case right now…If I were you, I don’t think I’d want to risk the record you have... How does it get better? It sure as hell can get worse.”</p> <p>Cooper’s words gave Raskin pause. The influential conservative lawyer was a partisan, but in that moment he was also their ally — and to date, he had been straight with them. If he thought they should drop this effort, maybe they should listen.</p> <p>“Well, that came up . . . Short,” Raskin joked awkwardly, making the obvious pun with the elusive witness’s surname.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Swalwell came back relaying his own deadend: Greg Pence hadn’t even answered his phone.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/38/41/d0ff5cf04e0f86a962ef66a984a2/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.coons.jpg\"> <br> <p>In the midst of the commotion, Senator Chris Coons walked through the door. The stocky lawyer from Delaware with a purposeful demeanor was a committed Democratic moderate known around the building as Biden’s closest ally in the Senate. Though he had just voted for witnesses, Coons couldn’t understand the logic of the managers’ gambit. And he was worried about the trial dragging out and hurting the new president. In fact, Trump’s defense lawyers, furious and blindsided by Raskin’s witness move, had vowed just before the vote that if Raskin called even one witness, they would seek to depose at least one hundred of their own, including Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris. That meant possibly hours of floor debate about which witnesses were relevant — and possibly days or weeks of testimony that could overshadow Biden’s presidency until late February or March. It was a threat that met its mark, as senators on the floor, including other Democrats who had just backed Raskin’s witness strategy, fretted about having to endure elongated proceedings. What’s more, Several Republicans had indicated to Coons that they were ready to convict the president — but if the trial spun out of control, there was no telling what might happen.</p> <p>With those frustrations in mind, Coons had marched into Schumer’s office and demanded to know what the hell was going on. Schumer had permitted the vote, but he also was befuddled by Raskin’s move. He told Coons he didn’t know what Raskin’s game plan was.<s> </s>The Democratic leader was skeptical the ploy would work anyway. If running for their lives on Jan. 6 wasn’t enough to persuade Republicans to convict Trump, then it was hard to believe any other witness would, Schumer reasoned. Coons, who held a similar mindset, offered to go talk to Raskin’s team himself to shut the entire thing down. When Schumer gave him the nod, the senator headed to find the managers.</p> <p>“I know when a jury is ready to vote, and this jury is ready to vote,” Coons declared when he entered the managers’ room.</p> <p>As the team gathered around him, Coons argued that Republicans had already made up their minds and that calling witnesses was a waste of time. Democrats, he argued, had bigger fish to fry: Biden still needed the Senate to confirm most of his Cabinet, and he had a legislative agenda to get onto the floor.</p> <p>“Dragging this out will not be good for the American project or for the American people. We’re trying to do a lot,” he said, choosing terms that sounded to the managers like they came straight from the White House. Coons floated a possible compromise: Have Herrera Beutler make a written affidavit detailing her story, Coons instructed. Then, let the defense get a statement from McCarthy and be done with it.</p> <p>“I’m not taking that deal,” Raskin said flatly, stunned that Coons, as a fellow lawyer, would expect any prosecutor to entertain such unsavory terms. “No way are we allowing McCarthy to deny Herrera Beutler’s story without cross-examining him.”</p> <p>But Coons was adamant. “You’re going to lose Republican votes,” he warned them. “Everyone here wants to go home. They have flights for Valentine’s Day. Some of them are already missing their flights.”</p> <p>Berke jumped in, telling Coons the managers hoped to depose Herrera Beutler and McCarthy by video conference that very day. “Listen, Senator, we hear you on the delay,” he said. “But I have to tell you this is going to go quickly ... And we can do closing arguments tomorrow.”</p> <p>Coons was incredulous at Berke’s naïveté. “That’s nuts!” he shot back. McCarthy would never agree to testify before retaining counsel, he retorted. If they were lucky — and that was a big if — it would take days to depose the GOP leader, not hours.</p> <p>“I encourage you all to just do affidavits,” Coons said sternly. “Do it today and reach a swift resolution.”</p> <p>As he turned to leave, Coons added one more thing. “And just to be clear,” he said over his shoulder, “I’m here speaking only for myself.”</p> <p>When the door closed behind him, the room broke into collective outrage.<br></p> <br> <p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Cicilline said, turning to Neguse. “We are impeaching a president of the United States for inciting a violent insurrection against the government, and these motherfuckers want to go home for Valentine’s Day? Really?”</p> <p>He wasn’t the only one who felt that way. The managers viewed their jobs as one of the most serious things they would ever do in their lives. And yet their own party was pressuring them so they could go enjoy the long weekend. How shortsighted. How repugnant. And how disrespectful.</p> <p>But for Raskin, Coons’ warnings began to revive the doubts that had plagued him earlier that morning. They had succeeded in getting the Senate to agree to witnesses in concept — but the truth was, they still didn’t have any witnesses in hand. Moreover, everyone in the room agreed that Coons wasn’t actually speaking for himself. He might deny it, but his words were as good as a warning from Biden. Despite the uneasiness caused by Coons’ words, the managers continued to forge ahead.</p> <p>Berke, Plaskett and Swalwell began working on questions for a potential cross-examination of McCarthy about his Trump call. Others, including Raskin, debated whether McCarthy would be willing to commit perjury under oath to protect Trump — or if he’d deny the Herrera Beutler story altogether, pitching the trial into an unresolvable he-said-she-said spat that would give Republicans another excuse to acquit.</p> <p>Raskin called Cheney again to get her take. “If we call McCarthy, will he be honest?” Raskin asked.</p> <p>On the other end of the line, Cheney thought about all the times McCarthy had flip-flopped, vowing to do one thing — then doing the exact opposite.</p> <p>“I don’t know,” she admitted.</p> <p>It was a deflating turn of events for the managers, who still weren’t ready to throw in the towel. They started brainstorming backup plans. “Maybe we give up on McCarthy and Short, and just subpoena Herrera Beutler,” one of them suggested. “Or we could subpoena just her notes to buy some time,” another offered.</p> <p>“We should delay the final vote at all costs so we can get the votes to convict,” Lieu declared. “And buy time to see if we can get in touch with anyone willing to tell their story.”</p> <p>Berke, seizing on the managers’ energy, offered an even more aggressive suggestion: So what if no one was offering to testify? Let’s call their bluff and ask the Senate to subpoena these witnesses anyway, he proposed. If acquittal was the alternative, what did they have to lose?<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e3/11/ac3afac14a56bc567ca58821dec3/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.witness.jpg\"> <br> <p>But Raskin wasn’t so sure he agreed. During Trump’s first impeachment trial, impeachment attorneys had argued that the courts would settle any disputes over Trump’s claims to privilege or immunity within a matter of weeks due to the serious nature of a Senate trial. The fact that Trump was no longer in the Oval Office — and could no longer make such claims — should have made their subpoenas even less vulnerable to lengthy court challenges. Yet in the heat of the moment, those same impeachment lawyers on Raskin’s team started losing their earlier confidence about the speed of judicial review. They began to ask themselves: What if these impeachment subpoenas turned out to be no different from their fight over former White House counsel Don McGahn, which was still crawling through the courts almost two years later?</p> <p>Further complicating that calculus was the Trump team’s vow to call a hundred witnesses. Technically, the threat was hollow. The Senate — not Trump’s lawyers and not the managers — had the ultimate authority to approve which subpoenas to issue by a simple majority vote. That meant Trump’s team could try to summon Pelosi or Harris or whomever they wanted, but as long as Senate Democrats stuck together, their efforts would fail. Nonetheless, the House managers began to worry. The time it would take to hold such partisan witness votes might undercut the impact of their presentations, some argued.</p> <p>“This isn’t working,” Matz pushed back on Berke. “We do have something to lose: time, momentum, credibility and persuasion.”</p> <p>As they deliberated, Schumer’s counsel, Mark Patterson, arrived with another possible deal to end the trial without witnesses. He’d been trying to negotiate a way out with the Trump team through McConnell’s counsel Andrew Ferguson, who also wanted to bring the trial to a swift end. They had all come to an agreement that “we are prepared to accept,” Patterson told Berke: the Trump team would allow Herrera Beutler’s statement to be entered into the record without any sort of retort from McCarthy — so long as the managers promised not to call a single witness.</p> <p>Patterson indicated that he thought the managers should take the deal.<br></p> <br> <p>Raskin was still wrestling with the decision when Coons appeared a second time at the doorway to hammer home his end-the-trial message. Republican senators were organizing to hamstring the managers’ witness plans, he declared. Two dozen of them had already decided they were in lockstep with Trump’s lawyer’s threat: If the managers called even one witness, they would force votes to call Pelosi, Harris and dozens more.</p> <p>“Everybody wants to go home,” the Delaware senator said impatiently. “Everybody is pissed, and this trial will unzip if even a single vote on a witness occurs.”</p> <p>The managers recoiled at Coons’ accusing tone.</p> <p>“We also answer to the American people, Senator!” Stacey Plaskett exploded.</p> <p>Coons took a deep breath. “Look, you have somewhere between 54 to 56 votes to convict, but you are losing a vote per hour,” Coons said, his annoyance escalating. “You have to make a decision. You’ve got to do it within the hour. Nobody’s mind is really open at this point.”</p> <p>With that, Coons disappeared again, and a pall fell over the room. The president’s unofficial interlocutor might as well have just clipped their wings — and the managers were plummeting back to reality. The Delaware senator’s warning that they might be losing the room to jury fatigue — just like Schiff’s team had during Trump’s first impeachment — petrified them. They’d been adamant that they would do their utmost to secure as many Republican votes as they could; now the suggestion that they could be undermining their own efforts by simply trying to unearth the truth was shocking — and crushing.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6f/63/2a2043c14e47b1caaa082060c14c/mag.Bade.TrumpImpeach.ender.jpg\"> <br> <p>The managers couldn’t believe they had found themselves in such a position. They had been chosen by the Speaker of the House to bring charges against a president who had incited an attack against a co-equal branch of government that had resulted in death and destruction and could have cost lawmakers’ lives. Calling witnesses to prosecute that outrage should have transcended any partisan roadblocks or practical inconveniences. It hadn’t. Even Senate Democrats — the people who were supposed to be their allies — were putting intense pressure on them to wrap up so they could move on to other things. Could they not appreciate that this was Congress’s last chance to oust Trump from American politics for good?</p> <p>Raskin knew his decision went beyond the tribulations of one political party. Trump was already on the rebound, with polls showing Republican voters once again rallying around him and GOP lawmakers growing more comfortable with re-embracing him. If there were ever a moment to stop that trend, or reverse it, the moment was now. Raskin had one shot at a captive audience in the Senate, as well as the millions of potential voters watching across the nation.</p> <p>Raskin might have been willing to risk all the political complexities of plowing forward —including the wrath of his own party — but for one glaring problem: In the two hours since the Senate vote, not a single witness had stepped forward. He had no idea that Herrera Beutler’s staffers, at that exact moment, were frantically reaching out to lawyers, hoping to consult one before she agreed to testify. She had even sought assistance from Pelosi’s House counsel Doug Letter, though Letter said he could not help her because he was working with the managers. He never conveyed her interest to Raskin.</p> <p>As the managers looked to him to make a decision, Raskin felt his hands were tied. He had always known it would be a longshot to get a Republican to testify against Trump. Still, he had hoped the gravity of the moment would compel at least one of them to step into the spotlight and put the good of the republic before the pull of their party.

Reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins&nbsp;Publishers.</i><br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Jamie Raskin’s eyes bulged as he skimmed the CNN story on his phone. Huddled with his team in the impeachment managers’ holding room after the Senate trial proceedings had finished on Friday evening, the Maryland Democrat was stunned at the revelations: A moderate House Republican whom Raskin had never met was claiming to have firsthand evidence that Trump had sided with the mob on Jan. 6.\n It was Feb. 12, 2021, and Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington had told CNN that Kevin McCarthy had confided he had spoken with the president during the insurrection. McCarthy, she said, told her Trump had flatly refused McCarthy’s plea for help despite knowing how chaotic and horrific the Capitol attack had been. In her notes, she had scribbled down one particularly damning utterance from the former president. “Well, Kevin,” McCarthy had recounted Trump as saying, “I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”\n Raskin, the lead manager in Trump’s second impeachment, gaped at the quote. “How can anybody hear this news and not convict him?!” he exclaimed.\n The story’s revelations only got more staggering. Other Republicans had also confirmed hearing about the McCarthy-Trump exchange. One even told CNN that Trump, despite his claims of innocence, was “not a blameless observer. He was rooting for them.”\n But Herrera Beutler had stuck out her neck furthest of all by describing Trump’s selfish nonchalance that day. “That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn’t care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry,” she told CNN. “We should never stand for that, for any reason, under any party flag.”\n Who was this woman? Raskin wanted to know. She had been among the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. But his familiarity with her began and ended there. Whatever her story, Raskin knew one thing: This other Jaime was about to become his best friend.\n \n  \n The story was dynamite, Raskin thought, and could blow up the last of the Trump team’s slipshod defense. Just a few hours earlier, the president’s counsel Michael van der Veen had argued — weakly — that Trump tried to protect his vice president from the hordes of rioters calling for his head. “I’m sure Mr. Trump very much is concerned and was concerned for the safety and well-being of Mr. Pence and everybody else that was over here,” he had said. It was a flimsy conjecture that everyone knew was a lie — and here was the proof.\n “We should try to reach out to this Jaime Herrera Beutler and get her notes,” Raskin told the managers in their prep room.\n “I know Jaime really well,” Diana DeGette of Colorado piped up, offering to be the go-between.\n “Try her and see if other House Republicans know about this call too,” Raskin instructed.\n Herrera Beutler’s revelations complicated an already frenzied Friday night. The managers had been caught flat-footed. When Trump’s lawyers had rested their case after just a couple of hours, setting up closing arguments for Saturday morning. The managers hadn’t expected to give their closing statements until Sunday or Monday and hadn’t yet written a word of them. Even before the CNN story landed, they were staring down another all-nighter in a week where they had barely slept.\n Raskin instructed anyone who wasn’t responsible for delivering final arguments to go home and get some rest. But as the managers started collecting their belongings, one of them, Eric Swalwell, posed a question to the room.\n “Hasn’t this CNN story changed things?” the California Democrat asked, pointing out that in much of that afternoon’s Q&A session, GOP senators had asked what Trump knew and didn’t know about the violence. The report, he argued, was an opportunity to give them answers in real time.\n “Shouldn’t we be calling for witnesses now?” Swalwell asked.\n Raskin paused. Swalwell had a point. But it was too massive a change in strategy to make a hasty decision.\n “We aren’t going to talk about witnesses now,” he said. “I’ll be in touch.”\n For weeks, Raskin had engaged in a top secret search for a firsthand witness from the president’s inner circle who could add something valuable to the narrative. His team had even privately sparred with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s team about leaving open the possibility of calling for new testimony — a move that ran counter to the New York Democrat’s eagerness for a quick trial so the party could move on to confirming President Joe Biden’s nominees. When none of their leads volunteered to come forward, Raskin had shrugged it off, projecting confidence that witnesses weren’t necessary to win. But Herrera Beutler’s account was making him rethink his decision. How could they refuse to have her explain her bombshell story?\n In the year-and-a-half-long saga of the two impeachments of Donald Trump, few moments better exemplify the susceptibility of impeachment to the political whims of Congress as the last, frantic 24 hours of Trump’s second trial. The absence of key firsthand accounts had created a major roadblock to conviction in Trump’s first impeachment. House Democrats had chosen to avoid pursuing witnesses to get the politically fraught effort over with as soon as possible, but that had cost them support among several moderate House and Senate Republicans who privately had been open to conviction. In the end, that first failed effort boosted the president’s popularity, emboldening rather than constraining him. But more than 250 interviews with key players in both parties would reveal that the same political calculations made on both sides of the aisle that ended up hobbling the first impeachment would also cripple the second. Republicans who had stuck their necks out to impeach Trump after Jan. 6 would hide in fear of political retaliation rather than help the managers in their effort to convict the former president. And Raskin and his team would learn to their dismay that their own party could prove equally obstructionist when it suited their political purposes.\n \n  \n   \n About an hour later, DeGette poked her head back in the room with a double whammy of bad news. Herrera Beutler’s cell had gone straight to voicemail. DeGette had sent a text asking to talk, but the Washington Republican still hadn’t responded. And DeGette’s efforts to find other Republicans aware of the McCarthy-Trump conversation had also come up short. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) of Michigan, one of the 10 GOP impeachers, told her that only Herrera Beutler had heard McCarthy’s tale, though the GOP leader had indeed conveyed the account to multiple people. That limited the number of people who could confirm the report to one, she conveyed to the team.\n At 9:30 p.m., just as Raskin and the rest of the managers were about to head home, signs of life from Herrera Beutler gave them new hope. She texted DeGette that she was on the West Coast with her children but would be in touch soon, inquiring about the managers’ timeline. DeGette told her they would resume the trial at 10 a.m. the next morning and to call her ASAP, indicating that they’d be interested in seeing her notes about McCarthy’s call. Maybe she’ll cooperate after all, Raskin thought as he departed the Capitol.\n Raskin was up late that night, waiting for smoke signals from Herrera Beutler, when team attorney Barry Berke called with more encouraging news. Swalwell had texted Congressman Greg Pence (R-Ind.) that night to inquire if his brother, the former vice president, would be willing to sit for a deposition. Pence had responded by texting back a shrug emoji — which as Swalwell read it, wasn’t saying no. Swalwell had then reached out to Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), another of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, who had also been in close contact with Pence world throughout the trial and whose wife was a former Pence staffer. Kinzinger told him that the vice president’s team was furious at Trump’s lawyers for suggesting the president had cared about Pence’s safety on Jan. 6 when he hadn’t checked on him once during the riot. He suggested the vice president might actually allow his team to testify to set the record straight and advised Swalwell to contact Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, who had been with him through the riot. Kinzinger gave Swalwell Short’s cell phone number, and Swalwell fired off a text.\n “We would like to receive your testimony about January 6 in any manner you were comfortable,” Swalwell wrote, after introducing himself to Short. The managers, he continued, would be willing to conduct a deposition behind closed doors, eschew cameras, and even stick to subjects Short was comfortable with. Anything to get his cooperation.\n “We are also able to provide a subpoena if that makes it easier to do so,” Swalwell offered. “Anything you can add would be helpful . . .We have to know soon as this may wrap tomorrow if we don’t have a witness.”\n \n  \n Then, Swalwell called Berke to give him an update.\n As Berke recounted Swalwell’s efforts to Raskin, he added that he had also enlisted the managers’ new ally Charles Cooper to help. Right before the trial, the prominent conservative attorney had done them an unexpected favor, penning an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal stating the impeachment trial was entirely constitutional — directly contradicting the talking point most Senate Republicans had been rallying around. Berke thought maybe Cooper would assist them in convincing Short to testify. Cooper said he’d reach out to his Pence contacts and report back.\n As he hung up the phone, Raskin could hardly believe their developing good fortune: The former vice president’s inner circle might be willing to refute Trump’s case! But what about Herrera\n Beutler? He looked at the clock. It was after 11 p.m. — 8 p.m. on the West Coast — and his team still hadn’t heard back from her. He picked up the phone to try her himself, but her mailbox was full. Desperate, Raskin left a message on her office’s general line, even though it was well after hours on Friday. He crossed his fingers that some staffer would get the message by morning and call him back. In his frustration, Raskin dialed Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) — the No. 3 House Republican who’d been secretly advising him on impeachment for weeks — to vent.\n “We’re trying our hardest to get in touch with Jaime Herrera Beutler,” he said.\n “Yeah, she seems to have gone into hiding,” Cheney replied.\n “I’m trying to get in touch with her,” Raskin said again.\n “I think she knows that,” Cheney said drily.\n A few hours later, when Raskin phoned Herrera Beutler again, she had cleared out her crowded voice mailbox. He tried to make himself sound as friendly and welcoming as possible. “We haven’t met yet, but I am a fellow Jamie and I’m eager to talk to you about impeachment,” he said. “Sorry these are arduous circumstances. Please call me back when you can.”\n \n  \n   \n The Signal chain on Raskin’s phone started exploding around 7:40 the next morning. His managers were unequivocal: They wanted witnesses. Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) sent a link to a New York Daily News story headlined: “Schumer says Senate will call witnesses for Trump’s trial — if impeachment managers want them.” The Senate majority leader is clearly putting this decision solely on us, he wrote. If we don’t call witnesses, we’re going to get massacred for pulling punches if we fail to convict.\n Swalwell chimed in to agree. Without tipping his hand about his late-night effort to woo Marc Short, he suggested they subpoena the former vice president, his former chief, and even the Secret Service agents who had been with Trump on Jan. 6. If those witnesses challenged their summons in court, Swalwell wrote, “we can ultimately say that we’ve tried.”\n The rest of the managers piled on. “Can someone explain to me the rationale for not trying to call witnesses?” manager Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) asked in clear frustration. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands) joined in, writing that while it may be “uncomfortable for the Senate” to extend the trial, the managers had a duty to take this case all the way.\n A senior staffer from the impeachment team pushed back and began highlighting all the complications with such a last-minute call.\n \n The people Swalwell recommended — including Short and Pence — “are likely to be hostile to us,” the staffer wrote. Plus, if they objected and took the matter to court, the legal battle could drag out for weeks or even months, the aide said, echoing — ironically — the same argument Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had made to justify sidestepping court fights for witnesses during Trump’s first impeachment, and which GOP leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later adopted during the trial.\n As Raskin’s security detail drove him the seven miles of North Capitol Street from his house to Capitol Hill, he quietly digested the frenzied messages dancing across his phone. Herrera Beutler still hadn’t called him back, and in less than two hours he was expected to launch into his closing arguments. But Raskin knew his team was right. The managers had only put one night of effort into securing testimony that could seal the former president’s fate, hardly enough to warrant giving up. Didn’t they have a duty to present the fullest story possible about what Trump had done — if not to secure a conviction, then at least for the history books?\n \n  \n When Raskin walked into the managers’ trial anteroom, Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) was staring out the window, whispering the last lines of his closing speech to himself in careful rehearsal. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) was also practicing for what was supposed to be the final moments of the trial. In the center of the room, Raskin’s staff was fighting over what to do. He joined them, knowing the final call would be his to make.\n The pro-witness camp, led by Berke, argued witnesses could be a powerful tool in convincing the nation — particularly Republican voters — of Trump’s misdeeds. The right witnesses might even change the minds of some GOP senators, he said, earning them enough votes for a conviction. Berke reminded them that Pence’s team had indicated through intermediaries that they might comply with a Senate subpoena. And they had two well-connected Republicans running interference: Cooper was reaching out to Pence’s team as they spoke, and Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had also promised the night before to make a personal appeal to the former vice president and his team, particularly Short.\n “Let’s start with Herrera Beutler and then see if others like Marc Short feel compelled to testify as well,” Berke proposed. “We have to try. If we don’t, the American people will never forgive us.”\n But team attorneys Joshua Matz and Aaron Hiller thought upending the trial with a witness Hail Mary was insane. “Once you open the door to witnesses, you destroy the momentum we’ve built — and we’ve already done a bang-up job,” Hiller argued. Plus, it was common knowledge that Pence wanted to run for president in 2024. What if he uses the opportunity to grandstand and curry favor with the base? What if he surprised them by saying the president did nothing wrong?\n “You want to call witnesses? Which witnesses? We don’t know!” Matz vented, laying out the possible dangers of going down that path. “Are they coming? We don’t know. What will they say? We also don’t know! How long will it take to get their testimony? Also unclear.”\n \n By Saturday morning, the idea of extending the trial to demand new testimony had caught on. Progressives, including former federal prosecutor-turned-senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, had taken to Twitter to insist Raskin’s team depose McCarthy and the Secret Service. It was becoming clear that if the managers made a play for witnesses, they would have the votes. Raskin nervously checked the time. In less than an hour, everyone — Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Schumer, Biden and the entire watching nation — was expecting him to walk onto the floor and argue that the managers had proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt and then end the trial. But there was nothing stopping him from calling for witnesses instead. The move, Raskin knew, was high-risk but potentially even higher reward. Republican senators had been signaling their keen interest in learning more of what Trump had said and done during those critical hours when the Capitol was under siege. Here was an opportunity to find out.\n Raskin knew that Democratic Party leaders wouldn’t be happy. They were eager to put impeachment behind them and move on to passing Biden’s agenda. But Raskin had always eschewed the political calculations that habitually guided those in leadership. For him, this wasn’t about political messaging, or the next election, or even how the trial would impact Biden’s planned policy agenda. This was about convincing most Americans that Trump should never hold office again. The lawyer in Raskin cringed at the idea of jumping into the unknown. If they overplayed their hand and things backfired, he knew he would be blamed for having led the managers’ case astray. But the idealist in him, the one who had pleaded so hard with his party’s superiors to chase every investigative lead to hold Trump accountable, could feel the lure of going all in. He just needed one more gut check.\n Raskin picked up his phone and dialed Cheney, peppering her with a final volley of queries. Would Herrera Beutler be a reliable witness? Were there others who might follow her lead? What did she think about calling witnesses in general? Cheney agreed with the move. Herrera Beutler, she assured Raskin, was an honorable woman who would tell the truth under oath. She would not grandstand. And better yet, she would make a compelling witness. That was all Raskin needed to hear: If Cheney trusted her, then he would as well.\n Just before 9:40 a.m., with the start of the trial 20 minutes away and still no word from Herrera Beutler, Raskin called the bustling anteroom to attention. Managers and staff dutifully gathered around a coffee table in the center of the room, filling an embroidered couch and chairs set up in a big circle. Once the room quieted, Raskin turned to his lead attorney, whom he knew was the most pro-witness of the bunch.\n “Barry, what do you think we should do?” he asked.\n “We don’t have a choice,” Berke responded. “We have to call witnesses.”\n “Yes, you’re right,” Raskin declared.\n \n A ripple of excitement spread through the team as managers seconded the decision with sighs of relief and cheers of Absolutely! and Yes! Immediately everyone jumped up to recalibrate their plans. In one corner, Matz, Berke and Hiller began frantically rewriting Raskin’s opening statement for the day. How would Trump’s attorneys react? And how will we respond to that response? No one knew.\n “Just write something fast!” one attorney shouted as they began scribbling a makeshift script.\n The other managers, meanwhile, began to plan their next steps. DeGette volunteered to try again to get ahold of Herrera Beutler, whom she’d been trying to reach all morning. Others began plotting when and how they could depose her if she agreed to testify. Would she come back to town today? If not, was a video interview possible? As a staffer informed Schumer’s team of their last-minute change in plans, Raskin made the most important phone call of all. In a dramatic departure from the first impeachment, Pelosi had let Raskin make the day-to-day decisions for the trial, as she promised she would. But this was a big enough shift that the speaker deserved a heads-up, Raskin reasoned. He gave her a chance to object, but he did not ask her permission.\n “We’ve got to go for this,” he told her. “We’ve got an opening.”\n “I trust your judgment,” she told Raskin. “It’s up to you.”\n \n  \n At 10 a.m., a Senate aide appeared at the door. It was time to start. As Raskin headed to the floor, he made a quick call to his Republican friend Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) for the first of what would become a series of last-minute sales pitches to unearth possible witnesses. As one of the 10 who had voted to impeach, Raskin figured Katko knew about this McCarthy tale that Herrera Beutler and the CNN story had exposed.\n “Are you willing to testify?” Raskin asked Katko as he walked into the chamber.\n Katko said no. He had heard personally from McCarthy about his Jan. 6 call with Trump, but the New York Republican didn’t mention that and played dumb.\n “I don’t have any relevant information,” he said. “You need Jaime. She’s all you need.”\n Katko would later insist for this book that he offered to testify if subpoenaed and he disputes that he told Raskin that Herrera Beutler “is all you need.” Both statements run contrary to the recollections of five members of the managers’ team who were closely following the mad dash for GOP witnesses that day.\n \n  \n   \n Jaime Herrera Beutler’s cell phone started ringing just after 7 a.m. Pacific time. On the other line, calling from Washington, D.C., one of her aides was in a panic. Raskin had just marched to the Senate floor and shocked the nation by making a pitch to call witnesses as part of a trial — including her. The motion had actually passed, 55 to 45, with almost no debate.\n “Oh my gosh, you’re being talked about in the middle of this!” the aide told her.\n Herrera Beutler was dumbfounded. She knew the managers had been trying to get in touch overnight. But neither Raskin nor DeGette had bothered to tell her that they planned to call her as a witness the next morning. A little heads-up would have been nice. Herrera Beutler was with her family that President’s Day weekend, hoping to get some time off the grid after the chaos following the CNN story the day before. She had not even been watching the trial.\n She flipped the television on. And sure enough, there, in the well of the Senate, Raskin was standing at the podium and citing the statement Herrera Beutler had instructed her staff to release the previous evening as reason to call witnesses. The Senate had no choice but to hear straight from her about “the president’s willful dereliction of duty,” he said.\n “Awesome,” she said sarcastically.\n Just a year before, Herrera Beutler had voted against Trump’s first impeachment, citing Democrats’ process fouls she felt could not be overlooked. She had even voted to reelect Trump in 2020 after refusing to back him in 2016. But Herrera Beutler had been deeply disturbed by what happened on Jan. 6. After evacuating in an astronaut-like escape hood from the balcony of the House chamber, where lawmakers had been trapped longest, she barricaded herself in the office of a fellow female Republican. When Trump went on television to praise his followers as “very special” people, she had lost her usual cool. She was so upset, in fact, that she had decided to record a video in her office around nine o’clock that night. In it she implored the nation to come together and reject fear, albeit without naming Trump specifically. Americans, she argued, had died for this democracy, and those rioters were making a sham of those sacrifices. “I had never thought I’d see this day. I felt like we were under siege!” she said. “Every American should be heartbroken. That’s how I felt.”\n While Herrera Beutler believed Trump had engaged in an impeachable dereliction of duty, she instructed her team to learn exactly what happened at the White House on Jan. 6 before deciding to condemn him. And she pumped her own contacts for info, particularly one well-connected friend: Kevin McCarthy. \n The details McCarthy disclosed about his call with Trump on the afternoon of the 6th had been the deciding factor in Herrera Beutler’s vote. It was clear to her Trump was not only responsible for the violence but had reveled in it. If that didn’t rise to the level of impeachment, she believed, nothing did.\n \n  \n Herrera Beutler had known that her vote would jeopardize her standing with Trump supporters in her GOP district. It was why she made a point of being upfront with constituents and explaining her thinking in interviews with local reporters and in town halls, including the details of her talk with McCarthy. So it came as a bit of a surprise when Liz Cheney called her a few days into the impeachment trial with an unusual request: A CNN reporter had heard about McCarthy’s call with Trump and was trying to confirm it, Cheney told her.\n Herrera Beutler rarely engaged with the national press, but she agreed to be interviewed. The details of McCarthy’s call might prove critical to establishing Trump’s thoughts and motivations. When the story had posted, Herrera Beutler braced for an angry call from McCarthy — but by late Friday night, she still hadn’t heard from him. Instead, it was the Democrats who were leaving frantic messages.\n Herrera Beutler had a pretty good idea of what they wanted. What good investigator wouldn’t want more information on the McCarthy-Trump phone call? But she felt it was not her story to tell; it was McCarthy’s. What’s more, she knew that there were others who could tell a similar tale. Halfway through the trial, before the CNN story shot Herrera Beutler into the spotlight, she had texted the other GOP impeachers to ask if McCarthy had ever shared the story of his Trump call with any of them. Multiple members on the chain — a support group of sorts they had dubbed “the band of brothers” — responded that he had.\n \n After the story broke, Herrera Beutler had instructed her team to issue a press release detailing the McCarthy-Trump call. They closed it with a line encouraging anyone who knew anything to step forward, hoping McCarthy would get the message. “To the patriots who were standing next to the former president as these conversations were happening, or even to the former vice president: If you have something to add here, now would be the time,” it read.\n She then turned her attention back to her family. But on Saturday morning, thanks to Raskin’s surprise move on the Senate floor, her hopes of having a calm weekend flew out the window.\n Herrera Beutler considered her options. She could decline to testify and take the easy way out —or she could do the brave thing and agree to tell her story. It was a choice that would come with consequences either way, she thought. But she had come this far already. After bucking her own party with a vote to impeach, what more was a deposition in the Senate?\n Find me a lawyer, she told her team. She needed professional advice before she took the plunge.\n \n  \n   \n As soon as the motion to call witnesses passed, Schumer called for an emergency recess and Raskin and his team retreated to their holding room. They were awash with adrenaline, but also struck with terror. They had succeeded in upending the trial completely — and they had no idea what to do next.\n Huddled in a corner with Berke and Matz, Raskin began furiously calling sympathetic Republicans to see if any would come forward. He dialed Herrera Beutler again. Still no answer. He left a message. Then he tried Katko again. That too went to voicemail. Steve Womack of Arkansas, a sympathetic GOP lawmaker repulsed by Trump, did pick up the phone. Did he know about the Herrera Beutler story? Did he know anything else that could help them? Raskin asked. Or did he know anyone who did know something — anything? Womack said he did not. Ditto with Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), another House Republican who had voted to impeach and sounded physically pained when Raskin introduced himself and asked for assistance.\n “You should talk to Pence’s people,” Meijer told Raskin, sighing loudly.\n Upton, the friendly Michigander who had indicated that other moderates would not be able to corroborate Herrera Beutler’s story, wasn’t much help either. When asked if he would be willing to be deposed, Upton declined apologetically and simply wished them luck. He, like Katko, still said nothing about how other moderates had heard the same story from McCarthy as Herrera Beutler.\n Outside, Washington was in an ecstatic fervor over Raskin’s surprise move. The city had expected Trump’s second impeachment trial to end that afternoon — but now, it seemed, there was a chance the Senate would be in it for the long haul, and possibly hearing firsthand evidence about Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. Progressive Democrats cheered the managers on, encouraging them not to leave a single stone unturned. Trump supporters panicked, decrying Raskin’s move as a sneak attack and threatening revenge.\n Inside the managers’ room, as Swalwell tried to call Greg Pence, Berke phoned Cooper to see if he’d had any luck finagling permission for Marc Short to testify. Raskin, standing next to him, watched on tenterhooks — and saw his counsel’s face sink. Berke then passed the phone over so Raskin could hear the bad news for himself. Cooper had spoken to Pence’s attorney Richard Cullen: They were not going to cooperate voluntarily. In fact, Pence’s team planned to fight the subpoenas if they were summoned, Cooper said, and had refused to give a preview of what Short might say if called. That meant the managers would have little indication of whether his story was even worth pursuing.\n “Don’t fuck this up by calling witnesses you might not get,” Cooper told Raskin candidly. “You have a good case right now…If I were you, I don’t think I’d want to risk the record you have... How does it get better? It sure as hell can get worse.”\n Cooper’s words gave Raskin pause. The influential conservative lawyer was a partisan, but in that moment he was also their ally — and to date, he had been straight with them. If he thought they should drop this effort, maybe they should listen.\n “Well, that came up . . . Short,” Raskin joked awkwardly, making the obvious pun with the elusive witness’s surname.\n A few minutes later, Swalwell came back relaying his own deadend: Greg Pence hadn’t even answered his phone.\n \n  \n In the midst of the commotion, Senator Chris Coons walked through the door. The stocky lawyer from Delaware with a purposeful demeanor was a committed Democratic moderate known around the building as Biden’s closest ally in the Senate. Though he had just voted for witnesses, Coons couldn’t understand the logic of the managers’ gambit. And he was worried about the trial dragging out and hurting the new president. In fact, Trump’s defense lawyers, furious and blindsided by Raskin’s witness move, had vowed just before the vote that if Raskin called even one witness, they would seek to depose at least one hundred of their own, including Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris. That meant possibly hours of floor debate about which witnesses were relevant — and possibly days or weeks of testimony that could overshadow Biden’s presidency until late February or March. It was a threat that met its mark, as senators on the floor, including other Democrats who had just backed Raskin’s witness strategy, fretted about having to endure elongated proceedings. What’s more, Several Republicans had indicated to Coons that they were ready to convict the president — but if the trial spun out of control, there was no telling what might happen.\n With those frustrations in mind, Coons had marched into Schumer’s office and demanded to know what the hell was going on. Schumer had permitted the vote, but he also was befuddled by Raskin’s move. He told Coons he didn’t know what Raskin’s game plan was. The Democratic leader was skeptical the ploy would work anyway. If running for their lives on Jan. 6 wasn’t enough to persuade Republicans to convict Trump, then it was hard to believe any other witness would, Schumer reasoned. Coons, who held a similar mindset, offered to go talk to Raskin’s team himself to shut the entire thing down. When Schumer gave him the nod, the senator headed to find the managers.\n “I know when a jury is ready to vote, and this jury is ready to vote,” Coons declared when he entered the managers’ room.\n As the team gathered around him, Coons argued that Republicans had already made up their minds and that calling witnesses was a waste of time. Democrats, he argued, had bigger fish to fry: Biden still needed the Senate to confirm most of his Cabinet, and he had a legislative agenda to get onto the floor.\n “Dragging this out will not be good for the American project or for the American people. We’re trying to do a lot,” he said, choosing terms that sounded to the managers like they came straight from the White House. Coons floated a possible compromise: Have Herrera Beutler make a written affidavit detailing her story, Coons instructed. Then, let the defense get a statement from McCarthy and be done with it.\n “I’m not taking that deal,” Raskin said flatly, stunned that Coons, as a fellow lawyer, would expect any prosecutor to entertain such unsavory terms. “No way are we allowing McCarthy to deny Herrera Beutler’s story without cross-examining him.”\n But Coons was adamant. “You’re going to lose Republican votes,” he warned them. “Everyone here wants to go home. They have flights for Valentine’s Day. Some of them are already missing their flights.”\n Berke jumped in, telling Coons the managers hoped to depose Herrera Beutler and McCarthy by video conference that very day. “Listen, Senator, we hear you on the delay,” he said. “But I have to tell you this is going to go quickly ... And we can do closing arguments tomorrow.”\n Coons was incredulous at Berke’s naïveté. “That’s nuts!” he shot back. McCarthy would never agree to testify before retaining counsel, he retorted. If they were lucky — and that was a big if — it would take days to depose the GOP leader, not hours.\n “I encourage you all to just do affidavits,” Coons said sternly. “Do it today and reach a swift resolution.”\n As he turned to leave, Coons added one more thing. “And just to be clear,” he said over his shoulder, “I’m here speaking only for myself.”\n When the door closed behind him, the room broke into collective outrage.\n \n “Are you fucking kidding me?” Cicilline said, turning to Neguse. “We are impeaching a president of the United States for inciting a violent insurrection against the government, and these motherfuckers want to go home for Valentine’s Day? Really?”\n He wasn’t the only one who felt that way. The managers viewed their jobs as one of the most serious things they would ever do in their lives. And yet their own party was pressuring them so they could go enjoy the long weekend. How shortsighted. How repugnant. And how disrespectful.\n But for Raskin, Coons’ warnings began to revive the doubts that had plagued him earlier that morning. They had succeeded in getting the Senate to agree to witnesses in concept — but the truth was, they still didn’t have any witnesses in hand. Moreover, everyone in the room agreed that Coons wasn’t actually speaking for himself. He might deny it, but his words were as good as a warning from Biden. Despite the uneasiness caused by Coons’ words, the managers continued to forge ahead.\n Berke, Plaskett and Swalwell began working on questions for a potential cross-examination of McCarthy about his Trump call. Others, including Raskin, debated whether McCarthy would be willing to commit perjury under oath to protect Trump — or if he’d deny the Herrera Beutler story altogether, pitching the trial into an unresolvable he-said-she-said spat that would give Republicans another excuse to acquit.\n Raskin called Cheney again to get her take. “If we call McCarthy, will he be honest?” Raskin asked.\n On the other end of the line, Cheney thought about all the times McCarthy had flip-flopped, vowing to do one thing — then doing the exact opposite.\n “I don’t know,” she admitted.\n It was a deflating turn of events for the managers, who still weren’t ready to throw in the towel. They started brainstorming backup plans. “Maybe we give up on McCarthy and Short, and just subpoena Herrera Beutler,” one of them suggested. “Or we could subpoena just her notes to buy some time,” another offered.\n “We should delay the final vote at all costs so we can get the votes to convict,” Lieu declared. “And buy time to see if we can get in touch with anyone willing to tell their story.”\n Berke, seizing on the managers’ energy, offered an even more aggressive suggestion: So what if no one was offering to testify? Let’s call their bluff and ask the Senate to subpoena these witnesses anyway, he proposed. If acquittal was the alternative, what did they have to lose?\n \n  \n But Raskin wasn’t so sure he agreed. During Trump’s first impeachment trial, impeachment attorneys had argued that the courts would settle any disputes over Trump’s claims to privilege or immunity within a matter of weeks due to the serious nature of a Senate trial. The fact that Trump was no longer in the Oval Office — and could no longer make such claims — should have made their subpoenas even less vulnerable to lengthy court challenges. Yet in the heat of the moment, those same impeachment lawyers on Raskin’s team started losing their earlier confidence about the speed of judicial review. They began to ask themselves: What if these impeachment subpoenas turned out to be no different from their fight over former White House counsel Don McGahn, which was still crawling through the courts almost two years later?\n Further complicating that calculus was the Trump team’s vow to call a hundred witnesses. Technically, the threat was hollow. The Senate — not Trump’s lawyers and not the managers — had the ultimate authority to approve which subpoenas to issue by a simple majority vote. That meant Trump’s team could try to summon Pelosi or Harris or whomever they wanted, but as long as Senate Democrats stuck together, their efforts would fail. Nonetheless, the House managers began to worry. The time it would take to hold such partisan witness votes might undercut the impact of their presentations, some argued.\n “This isn’t working,” Matz pushed back on Berke. “We do have something to lose: time, momentum, credibility and persuasion.”\n As they deliberated, Schumer’s counsel, Mark Patterson, arrived with another possible deal to end the trial without witnesses. He’d been trying to negotiate a way out with the Trump team through McConnell’s counsel Andrew Ferguson, who also wanted to bring the trial to a swift end. They had all come to an agreement that “we are prepared to accept,” Patterson told Berke: the Trump team would allow Herrera Beutler’s statement to be entered into the record without any sort of retort from McCarthy — so long as the managers promised not to call a single witness.\n Patterson indicated that he thought the managers should take the deal.\n \n Raskin was still wrestling with the decision when Coons appeared a second time at the doorway to hammer home his end-the-trial message. Republican senators were organizing to hamstring the managers’ witness plans, he declared. Two dozen of them had already decided they were in lockstep with Trump’s lawyer’s threat: If the managers called even one witness, they would force votes to call Pelosi, Harris and dozens more.\n “Everybody wants to go home,” the Delaware senator said impatiently. “Everybody is pissed, and this trial will unzip if even a single vote on a witness occurs.”\n The managers recoiled at Coons’ accusing tone.\n “We also answer to the American people, Senator!” Stacey Plaskett exploded.\n Coons took a deep breath. “Look, you have somewhere between 54 to 56 votes to convict, but you are losing a vote per hour,” Coons said, his annoyance escalating. “You have to make a decision. You’ve got to do it within the hour. Nobody’s mind is really open at this point.”\n With that, Coons disappeared again, and a pall fell over the room. The president’s unofficial interlocutor might as well have just clipped their wings — and the managers were plummeting back to reality. The Delaware senator’s warning that they might be losing the room to jury fatigue — just like Schiff’s team had during Trump’s first impeachment — petrified them. They’d been adamant that they would do their utmost to secure as many Republican votes as they could; now the suggestion that they could be undermining their own efforts by simply trying to unearth the truth was shocking — and crushing.\n \n  \n The managers couldn’t believe they had found themselves in such a position. They had been chosen by the Speaker of the House to bring charges against a president who had incited an attack against a co-equal branch of government that had resulted in death and destruction and could have cost lawmakers’ lives. Calling witnesses to prosecute that outrage should have transcended any partisan roadblocks or practical inconveniences. It hadn’t. Even Senate Democrats — the people who were supposed to be their allies — were putting intense pressure on them to wrap up so they could move on to other things. Could they not appreciate that this was Congress’s last chance to oust Trump from American politics for good?\n Raskin knew his decision went beyond the tribulations of one political party. Trump was already on the rebound, with polls showing Republican voters once again rallying around him and GOP lawmakers growing more comfortable with re-embracing him. If there were ever a moment to stop that trend, or reverse it, the moment was now. Raskin had one shot at a captive audience in the Senate, as well as the millions of potential voters watching across the nation.\n Raskin might have been willing to risk all the political complexities of plowing forward —including the wrath of his own party — but for one glaring problem: In the two hours since the Senate vote, not a single witness had stepped forward. He had no idea that Herrera Beutler’s staffers, at that exact moment, were frantically reaching out to lawyers, hoping to consult one before she agreed to testify. She had even sought assistance from Pelosi’s House counsel Doug Letter, though Letter said he could not help her because he was working with the managers. He never conveyed her interest to Raskin.\n As the managers looked to him to make a decision, Raskin felt his hands were tied. He had always known it would be a longshot to get a Republican to testify against Trump. Still, he had hoped the gravity of the moment would compel at least one of them to step into the spotlight and put the good of the republic before the pull of their party. It came as a gut punch to realize that when he needed it most, there was no help to be found. Even after a president had tried to lay waste to the fundamental tenets of representative democracy, politics — not principle — was still king of the Hill.\n Not 10 minutes after Coons left, Raskin caved.\n “Let’s take the deal,” he said.\n Adapted from UNCHECKED: The Untold Story Behind Congress’s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump by Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian, to be published Oct. 18 by William Morrow.

Adam Kinzinger, one of the most prominent Republican critics of former President Donald Trump in Congress, is rolling out a bipartisan series of midterm endorsements Tuesday, including a handful of Democrats seeking to become their states’ top election officials.\n Kinzinger (R-Ill.) endorsed four Democratic secretary of state candidates: incumbents Steve Simon of Minnesota and Jocelyn Benson of Michigan, along with Arizona’s Adrian Fontes and Nevada’s Cisco Aguilar, both of whom are running for open seats. Kinzinger’s endorsements, shared first with POLITICO, also include Democrat Josh Shapiro’s campaign for governor of Pennsylvania, where he would appoint the secretary of state if he wins.\n In an interview, Kinzinger said he chose 2022 endorsements partly based on where there are “going to be positions that, frankly, can be bulwarks to defend against a real constitutional crisis in 2024.”\n “A badly-placed, bad faith secretary of state can really throw the whole country into chaos,” he added.\n Kinzinger also backed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who successfully fended off a Trump-backed primary challenger this year after refusing to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results. And Kinzinger gave another endorsement to Arizona Democratic gubernatorial nominee Katie Hobbs, the state’s current secretary of state.\n Kinzinger, who did not seek reelection this year, is making the endorsements through his leadership PAC, Country First. His endorsement list also included a handful of federal candidates. He backed Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who is facing a Trump-backed challenger in her state, and Evan McMullin, the 2016 presidential candidate who is running an independent challenge to Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n \n “It’s easy for me as a pushed-out or a homeless Republican to just stick with Republicans — to get involved in the primaries and kind of go away for the general,” Kinzinger said of his decision to back Democratic candidates. “But I and my group … want to put our money where our mouth is. The reality is we can disagree on policy, but that defense of democracy is the thing that I think can bring the union down” if it isn’t upheld.\n Kinzinger said he’ll do “a little” traveling for the races, but his group’s focus will be turning out supporters in these races and helping with fundraising and advertising: “We want to take a rifle-shot approach, not a shotgun approach.”\n The Jan. 6 committee member is also supporting longshot candidates in generally safe districts — Republican Larry Lazor in Connecticut’s blue 1st District and independent Clint Smith in Arizona’s red 5th District — along with Thomas Knecht, a Republican state House candidate in Minnesota.\n The endorsements come amid more intense attention on election administration positions, as allies of Trump look to win control of the country’s election infrastructure. Kinzinger’s political operation has already been active here as well: A group of his allies backed Raffensperger during his primary earlier this year, and they recently launched a recruitment effort for “pro-democracy” candidates, with a particular focus on election official positions.\n Over the weekend, Trump rallied with a pair of Republican secretary of state candidates who have embraced conspiracy theories about Trump’s loss in the 2020 election: Nevada’s Jim Marchant and Arizona’s Mark Finchem. The two are core members of the America First Secretary of State Coalition, a group of election deniers who are running for office.\n Both won competitive GOP primaries earlier this year, and recent polls from CNN in each state showed them with small leads over Aguilar and Fontes, respectively.","dc:creator":"Zach Montellaro","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/d5/80/301b8dc64ee3aa5f2904b2601db2/aptopix-capitol-riot-investigation-95910.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Patrick Semansky/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Rep.

But Democrats have barely spent a dime on TV to take him down.</p> <p>The decision, according to those involved, was driven by a relative lack of resources: As Republicans’ biggest House super PAC floods the election with hundreds of millions of dollars, their Democratic counterparts have lagged far behind. Some members of the California Democratic delegation were alarmed by the decision to leave Garcia’s district untouched — and they have urged their party’s campaign arm in recent weeks not to abandon a seat that President Joe Biden won by double digits, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.</p> <p>Similar pleas are coming from Texas, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as frustrated Democrats bemoan that their party’s outside groups are unable — or, some say privately, unwilling — to devote precious funds toward what they see as winnable seats.</p> <p>The result is a shrinking battlefield for Democrats that has seen leadership and rank-and-file members alike pressuring the rest of their party, including Biden, to pony up more support in a bid to save the House majority.

Despite high candidate fundraising, Democrats have been unable to respond with the same volume of money, and the party has struggled to free up the resources to attack potentially endangered Republican incumbents — a crucial part of their strategy, since they need to offset expected losses in more conservative Democratic-held districts.</p> <p>Democrats currently<b> </b>have just a 5-seat majority and already seem to be abandoning some tough seats that their incumbents currently hold in Arizona, Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan.</p> <p>“The No. 1 factor here is money,” said Tim Persico, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p> <p>In an interview, Persico didn’t rule out late spending in any race but cited the looming cash crunch. Asked about Engel in Arizona, he said she “deserves” to be supported.</p> <p>“If we had more resources, I would love to be here,\" Persico said. \"It’s one of the heartbreakers of this cycle so far.”</p> <p>Altogether, national Democratic groups aren’t airing TV ads in six of the 14 Republican-held districts that went for Biden in 2020 — seats that are among the most important to contest. That includes the district represented by Garcia, who won in 2020 by 333 votes.</p> <p>On top of that, Republican outside spending is forcing Democrats to divert precious resources to what should be safe blue districts.

Mike Garcia holds one of House Republicans’ most vulnerable districts. But Democrats have barely spent a dime on TV to take him down.\n The decision, according to those involved, was driven by a relative lack of resources: As Republicans’ biggest House super PAC floods the election with hundreds of millions of dollars, their Democratic counterparts have lagged far behind. Some members of the California Democratic delegation were alarmed by the decision to leave Garcia’s district untouched — and they have urged their party’s campaign arm in recent weeks not to abandon a seat that President Joe Biden won by double digits, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.\n Similar pleas are coming from Texas, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as frustrated Democrats bemoan that their party’s outside groups are unable — or, some say privately, unwilling — to devote precious funds toward what they see as winnable seats.\n The result is a shrinking battlefield for Democrats that has seen leadership and rank-and-file members alike pressuring the rest of their party, including Biden, to pony up more support in a bid to save the House majority. The anxiety is especially acute in southern Arizona, where retiring Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has been lobbying her party to help Kirsten Engel, the Democratic nominee vying to replace her.\n “I know with every bone in my body that Engel will win this district if we can get DCCC investing sooner,” Kirkpatrick said of her swing seat where national Republicans have spent over $1.3 million so far on TV. “I understand the impossible decisions they have to make each cycle but coming in late and undervaluing this race is a huge mistake. This is a seat we keep blue if we go big now.\"\n \n House Democrats’ panic has escalated this month as GOP outside groups continued to smash fundraising records. Despite high candidate fundraising, Democrats have been unable to respond with the same volume of money, and the party has struggled to free up the resources to attack potentially endangered Republican incumbents — a crucial part of their strategy, since they need to offset expected losses in more conservative Democratic-held districts.\n Democrats currently have just a 5-seat majority and already seem to be abandoning some tough seats that their incumbents currently hold in Arizona, Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan.\n “The No. 1 factor here is money,” said Tim Persico, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n In an interview, Persico didn’t rule out late spending in any race but cited the looming cash crunch. Asked about Engel in Arizona, he said she “deserves” to be supported.\n “If we had more resources, I would love to be here,\" Persico said. \"It’s one of the heartbreakers of this cycle so far.”\n Altogether, national Democratic groups aren’t airing TV ads in six of the 14 Republican-held districts that went for Biden in 2020 — seats that are among the most important to contest. That includes the district represented by Garcia, who won in 2020 by 333 votes.\n On top of that, Republican outside spending is forcing Democrats to divert precious resources to what should be safe blue districts. Democrats’ top super PAC this week slashed a planned TV blitz in Los Angeles, which could have targeted Garcia, and Tucson, where Engel is running, to redeploy the money elsewhere.\n “The stakes are high here and we need all hands on deck,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who has been dialing up fellow Democrats to encourage them to pay their full party dues to help save the majority. “We don’t want to leave millions of dollars on the table.\"\n Regarding a district like Garcia’s, he added: “If Biden won by double digits, we ought to be able to either win or hold that district. But we gotta have the resources.”\n Top Democrats insist the fight is not over. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hosted a trio of big fundraisers in California in recent days, with headliners including former President Barack Obama and First Lady Jill Biden. She hosted Biden in Los Angeles on Thursday, as the Democratic National Committee announced transfers of $1 million each to Democrats’ House and Senate campaign arms.\n Pelosi and her leadership team have also increased pressure on fellow members to give more to the party group. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, for one, has urged all committee chairs to call members and encourage them to pay DCCC dues in the final few weeks, according to people familiar with the conversations. Several rank-and-file Democrats seeking top committee slots next year have been making similar calls.\n They’re pressing an argument bigger than the House majority. They say saving even a seat or two would make Biden’s life less painful by dealing with a smaller GOP majority. An infusion of about $20 million, according to one senior Democrat, could hold the House.\n Some in the party are more blunt: “With $55 million in the bank, the White House has got to understand that the highest and best use of their time and money is to leave it all on the field to protect the House majority,” said one Democrat involved in House races, citing the ability to shield Biden from GOP-run investigations. “They have done a lot, but it's not enough.\"\n Biden advisers and party officials have repeatedly defended their collective contributions to Democrats in the midterms as the most far-reaching of any administration, including millions of dollars transferred to House Democrats and a coordinated campaign in several battleground states that pays for staff and organizing on the ground.\n A shrinking target list\n Democrats have always known that their campaign chief, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), would be forced to make difficult decisions to prioritize some races over others closer to Nov. 8. Meaningful party spending has not begun — and is unlikely to start — in Rep. Tom O’Halleran’s (D-Ariz.) district and another three open Democratic-held districts in Wisconsin, Michigan and South Texas trending away from the party.\n But some lawmakers and strategists say they’re still worried about not being unable to spend on offense. For instance, Democrats are spending on TV to aid roughly half of the three dozen candidates the DCCC designated as the party’s most formidable challengers. And the lack of investment to target Republicans in Biden-won seats is particularly noticeable.\n Even in a good year for Republicans, Garcia, a former Navy pilot, faces strong headwinds in his northern Los Angeles district, which Biden carried by 13 points — a higher margin than almost any other member of the House GOP conference.\n National Republicans have spent nearly $1.8 million so far to aid Garcia. No Democratic groups have helped repeat challenger Christy Smith in the exorbitantly expensive Los Angeles media market.\n \n  \n Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who joined Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) at a campaign event for Smith last week, said he was optimistic that she would win — but acknowledged the deluge of GOP cash there.\n “Republicans always come in with literally millions and millions and millions at the last minute. But we’ve got the better candidate,” Cárdenas said. “Hopefully we’ll see some other resources get poured in, too.”\n In nearby Orange County, no help has come for Democrats Jay Chen and Asif Mahmood, underdogs challenging GOP Reps. Michelle Steel and Young Kim, respectively. Biden carried both districts.\n Pricey media markets are a common theme among the Democratic candidates not getting aid in districts where the fundamentals look reasonable for the party. That includes Jevin Hodge, the challenger to Rep. David Schweikert outside of Phoenix, and Bridget Fleming, a recruit who is running for an open seat on Long Island. Biden won those districts narrowly.\n Democratic outside groups have also been unable to provide support to Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo, who is challenging GOP Rep. Maria Salazar in a Miami district Biden narrowly lost.\n Democrats are funding air cover for several challengers running in GOP-held districts, including Greg Landsman in Ohio and Hillary Scholten in Michigan. But the national party has not been able to support others in less Biden-friendly districts, including Iowa state Sen. Liz Mathis and Iowa state Rep. Christina Bohannan, two highly touted recruits running in Iowa swing seats, or Jackie Gordon, who is running for an open seat in New York.\n \"We're fortunate that we've had a lot of support nationally,” said Landsman, who is trying to unseat Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) in a newly competitive Cincinnati-area seat.\n He called it “one of the most significant races” to hold the majority and said national Democrats agree. “They've seen that, they know that, they're investing significantly,” Landsman said.\n And Democratic groups are still plowing money into Democratic-leaning seats held by Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) and Rep. Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.), as well as retiring Rep. G.K. Butterfield’s (D-N.C.) district and a newly created seat in Springfield, Ill. Republicans have not matched spending in those seats.\n But the Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, has been blasting Democrats with a late TV ad spree in other districts. It announced Thursday that it crossed the $200 million spending mark as it dumped more money into several races that Biden won by more than 10 points, including seats held by Reps. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) and Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) and an open seat in Rhode Island.\n The DCCC, House Majority PAC and other allied groups have rallied to try to match that spending.\n “Expanding the map has been a key plank of our strategy this cycle,” said Dan Conston, who leads CLF. “We’re able to seriously contest traditional Democrat-leaning seats and that has forced Democrats into tough decisions about who to cut off and who they can afford to contest.”\n Jordain Carney and Christopher Cadelago contributed to this article.","dc:creator":"Ally Mutnick and Sarah Ferris","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/a0/18/5d9aa0ba446d92f923e26067a64c/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1417750955"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hosted a trio of big fundraisers in California in recent days, with headliners including former President Barack Obama and First Lady Jill Biden.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/a0/18/5d9aa0ba446d92f923e26067a64c/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1417750955"}}]},"content":"The party isn't airing ads in six of the 14 GOP districts Joe Biden carried in 2020, as it directs money to help incumbents under threat.","contentSnippet":"The party isn't airing ads in six of the 14 GOP districts Joe Biden carried in 2020, as it directs money to help incumbents under threat.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/house-democrats-face-painful-choices-as-gop-money-bomb-buckles-the-map-00061812","isoDate":"2022-10-14T08:30:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Kelly Hooper and Kyle Cheney","title":"Trump doesn’t say whether he’ll testify in letter to Jan. 6 committee","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/trump-testify-letter-jan-6-committee-00061859","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 10:00:58 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a8/e4/09af27434401b5611c2f856bac3f/trump-58922.jpg\"> <br> <p>Former President Donald Trump, in a winding 14-page letter to the Jan. 6 select committee on Friday, declined to divulge whether he’d comply with the panel’s subpoena and testify before it.</p> <p>Trump instead used the letter, addressed to committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), to rail against what he called the “unselect” committee’s yearlong investigation, which has amassed a wealth of evidence on the former president’s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election that culminated with the Jan. 6 raid on the capitol by Trump supporters.

The committee voted unanimously on Thursday to subpoena the former president, moving the panel into what’s expected to be its final phase.\n “Despite very poor television ratings, the Unselect Committee has perpetuated a Show Trial the likes of which this Country has never seen before,” Trump said in the letter, which he shared on Truth Social on Friday morning.\n \n \n The former president also criticized the Jan. 6 committee in the letter for not investigating his long-held, baseless claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and repeated his false claims that he won the election over President Joe Biden. The committee has shown evidence that Trump himself knew he had lost the election and had been informed repeatedly by White House, campaign and Justice Department aides that claims to the contrary were false.\n Trump also sought to blame the attack by his own supporters on the Capitol — a group he assembled in Washington and then urged to march on Congress — on Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump and his allies have long accused Pelosi, without basis, of somehow resisting the deployment of National Guard troops in advance of Jan. 6. In reality, security decisions were based on what law enforcement agencies said was intelligence that there could be street violence, not a concerted attack on the Capitol. The select committee has shown evidence that some of these agencies downplayed evidence of potential violence against Congress or failed to pass along tips.\n \n \n Trump also attached to the end of the letter what he called “determinative evidence” that the election was stolen — a compendium of well-worn, discredited claims — and appended a few photos of the huge crowd of his supporters on the National Mall on Jan. 6.\n He made no mention of whether he would comply with the committee’s subpoena to testify, leaving the panel’s chances of obtaining his deposition unclear. A legal effort to get Trump to testify would likely take far longer than the roughly two months remaining before the select committee sunsets at the end of the current Congress, and the move to subpoena a former president is largely unprecedented. Trump would be only the fourth president to ever testify before Congress. Only one former president since 1900 has been subpoenaed by Congress: Harry Truman, who defied the summons.\n \n \n Although he gave no answer in his Friday letter, Trump has offered small signals thus far that he is at least considering speaking to the Jan. 6 panel, including a Truth Social post earlier Friday morning linking to a Fox News article that reported a “source close to the former president” said Trump “loves the idea of testifying” before the committee.\n Still, the former president appears unlikely to take the legal risk of testifying at a time when multiple criminal inquiries are pursuing evidence of Trump’s and his allies' efforts to subvert the 2020 election. He has previously declined efforts to testify in congressional inquiries related to his conduct, including the 2021 impeachment inquiry about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and select committee members are skeptical that the former president will comply with their subpoena.\n Nicholas Wu contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Kelly Hooper and Kyle Cheney","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/a8/e4/09af27434401b5611c2f856bac3f/trump-58922.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Pool photo by José Luis Villegas","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Former President Donald Trump pauses while speaking at a rally in Minden, Nev., on Oct. 8, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/a8/e4/09af27434401b5611c2f856bac3f/trump-58922.jpg"}}]},"content":"Trump used the letter, addressed to committee Chair Bennie Thompson, to rail against what he called the “unselect” committee’s yearlong investigation.","contentSnippet":"Trump used the letter, addressed to committee Chair Bennie Thompson, to rail against what he called the “unselect” committee’s yearlong investigation.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/trump-testify-letter-jan-6-committee-00061859","isoDate":"2022-10-14T15:00:58.000Z"},{"creator":"Eli Stokols","title":"Biden calls on Nury Martinez, other L.A. councilmembers to resign after audio leak ","link":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-10-11/white-house-la-council-scandal-martinez-resign","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 20:17:59 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Biden believes Nury Martinez and other L.A.

To which McPhillips replied: “Fuck around and find out, grifters.”</p> <p>But it’s a charge the group rejects, saying the super PAC has been transparent with donors, and is only looking to help elect Democrats.<br></p> <br> <p>The Democratic Coalition has been around since 2016, when it launched as the Democratic Coalition Against Trump amid a wave of similar-minded organizations looking to harness the #Resistance energy that animated critics of the then-president.</p> <p>Rebranded as the Democratic Coalition, it is run by progressive consultant and fundraiser Scott Dworkin. The group bills itself as “one of the largest grassroots Resistance operations in the country.” One landing page for the group on the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue says the super PAC plans to “produce ads to support Dems in competitive races, level hard-hitting opposition research against Republicans across the country, and lead an unmatched online organizing operation.”</p> <p>Various social media feeds for the Democratic Coalition and Dworkin alike — <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/Dworkin\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;you name the platform, they’re on it&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linktr.ee/Dworkin&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58a3000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58a3000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">you name the platform, they’re on it</a> — resemble a progressive red-meat content farm, while Dworkin’s podcasts feature interviews with #Resistance-era heroes like former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, one-time Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas and recaps of Democratic candidates’ “domination” in election debates.</p> <p>The more recent content included a video portraying Fetterman as a champion of the working class who would act as a bulwark against encroachments on democracy, women’s rights and health care.</p> <p>Dworkin said the near-constant stream of content pushed out by the group, as well as its Fetterman video, are “part of our mission to reach as many voters as possible through organic social media every day of the year.”</p> <p>The group has collected $350,000 this cycle, FEC filings show — the vast majority of which has come from small-dollar donors giving less than $200. The committee has reported no independent expenditures either supporting or opposing federal candidates this cycle, compared with the $73,000 it dropped in the lead-up to the 2020 election and Georgia Senate runoffs.</p> <p>The roughly $20,000 the super PAC spent on Facebook ads through August amounts to just 6 percent of its total disbursements. The group has dropped another $900 on the platform in the past 30 days, according to Facebook’s ad library, but those ads only began to mention specific candidates and target users in Pennsylvania and Ohio beginning in this month.</p> <p>By contrast, more than half of the super PAC’s $330,000 in disbursements has flowed to the committee’s employees or firms run by them, filings show.</p> <p>Nearly a fifth of the Democratic Coalition’s spending this cycle, $65,000, has gone to Bulldog Finance Group, a fundraising firm founded by Dworkin. That’s lower than the amount the group sent to the firm in past cycles. But according to campaign finance filings, the Democratic Coalition has been the firm’s only client since 2017.</p> <p>The committee’s treasurer, Sonya McGrady, is its next highest beneficiary of its expenditures, taking in $50,000 this cycle through the end of August. The Democratic Coalition has also paid $41,000 and $37,000, respectively, to senior adviser Sam Jones for fundraising services and to the digital consulting firm of another senior adviser, Chuck Westover.</p> <p>“Our group's modest fundraising has done nothing but help Democratic campaigns and causes,” Dworkin said. “Our group’s messaging has driven billions of impressions over the years and we have built a massive megaphone to help amplify our allies, which we will continue to utilize for years to come.”</p> <p>Dworkin argued that the nature of the Democratic Coalition’s work doesn’t translate well into FEC’s reporting requirements. “Because we are active on social networks on a daily basis, it requires relentless activity from our team, and so most of our expenses are labor related,” he said.</p> <p>Moreover, he added, “generating organic activity for candidates doesn’t meet the reporting requirement of buying a paid advertisement because it is based on earned social media reach.”</p> <p>In the case of the Fetterman video, Dworkin said the objective was “to fire up base voters in Pennsylvania,” and that the video’s accompanying hashtag, #VoteFetterman, “peaked at #8 nationally” on Twitter. It cost the Democratic Coalition $2,000 to produce the ad, he argued. He compared that to a campaign that would have likely paid six figures to have a “Twitter takeover.”</p> <p>Dworkin said the super PAC raised only $280 off the video, which asked viewers to “donate today and help us show this awesome Fetterman ad to swing voters in Pennsylvania.” He defended the solicitation by noting the group also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemCoalition/status/1577306162206212098\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;fired off a tweet&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/TheDemCoalition/status/1577306162206212098&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58a3000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58a3000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">fired off a tweet</a> to its over half-million followers containing a link to donate directly to Fetterman’s campaign. That tweet came before McPhillips went after the group</p> <p>Though Fetterman’s campaign cast the group as a scam PAC, there are no legal requirements that spell out what percentage of a PAC’s spending must be put toward politicking — or paying their employees.</p> <p>That ambiguity has allowed political action committees to engage in conduct ranging from apparent self-dealing to actual fraud, which the federal government has only recently begun to mobilize in earnest to combat.</p> <p>Such activity has flourished on both the left and right, growing serious enough <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/scam-pacs-are-on-the-rise-041521\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;to trigger a warning from the FBI&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/scam-pacs-are-on-the-rise-041521&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58a3000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-dece-d952-a9b7-decf58a3000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">to trigger a warning from the FBI</a> in 2021 urging would-be donors to be on the lookout for such schemes, calling disbursements to vendors associated with a PAC’s operators “a red flag.”</p> <p>Still, “for First Amendment reasons and others, PACs have a fair amount of flexibility in how they spend their money,” said Erin Chlopak, senior director for campaign finance at the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, who pointed out that “frankly, it does cost money … to run ads and support candidates and so fundraising is a legitimate part of PAC activity.”</p> <p>That makes it hard to police the issue, and means that it’s mainly up to donors to determine where they want to send their money.

To which McPhillips replied: “Fuck around and find out, grifters.”\n But it’s a charge the group rejects, saying the super PAC has been transparent with donors, and is only looking to help elect Democrats.\n \n The Democratic Coalition has been around since 2016, when it launched as the Democratic Coalition Against Trump amid a wave of similar-minded organizations looking to harness the #Resistance energy that animated critics of the then-president.\n Rebranded as the Democratic Coalition, it is run by progressive consultant and fundraiser Scott Dworkin. The group bills itself as “one of the largest grassroots Resistance operations in the country.” One landing page for the group on the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue says the super PAC plans to “produce ads to support Dems in competitive races, level hard-hitting opposition research against Republicans across the country, and lead an unmatched online organizing operation.”\n Various social media feeds for the Democratic Coalition and Dworkin alike — you name the platform, they’re on it — resemble a progressive red-meat content farm, while Dworkin’s podcasts feature interviews with #Resistance-era heroes like former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, one-time Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas and recaps of Democratic candidates’ “domination” in election debates.\n The more recent content included a video portraying Fetterman as a champion of the working class who would act as a bulwark against encroachments on democracy, women’s rights and health care.\n Dworkin said the near-constant stream of content pushed out by the group, as well as its Fetterman video, are “part of our mission to reach as many voters as possible through organic social media every day of the year.”\n The group has collected $350,000 this cycle, FEC filings show — the vast majority of which has come from small-dollar donors giving less than $200. The committee has reported no independent expenditures either supporting or opposing federal candidates this cycle, compared with the $73,000 it dropped in the lead-up to the 2020 election and Georgia Senate runoffs.\n The roughly $20,000 the super PAC spent on Facebook ads through August amounts to just 6 percent of its total disbursements. The group has dropped another $900 on the platform in the past 30 days, according to Facebook’s ad library, but those ads only began to mention specific candidates and target users in Pennsylvania and Ohio beginning in this month.\n By contrast, more than half of the super PAC’s $330,000 in disbursements has flowed to the committee’s employees or firms run by them, filings show.\n Nearly a fifth of the Democratic Coalition’s spending this cycle, $65,000, has gone to Bulldog Finance Group, a fundraising firm founded by Dworkin. That’s lower than the amount the group sent to the firm in past cycles. But according to campaign finance filings, the Democratic Coalition has been the firm’s only client since 2017.\n The committee’s treasurer, Sonya McGrady, is its next highest beneficiary of its expenditures, taking in $50,000 this cycle through the end of August. The Democratic Coalition has also paid $41,000 and $37,000, respectively, to senior adviser Sam Jones for fundraising services and to the digital consulting firm of another senior adviser, Chuck Westover.\n “Our group's modest fundraising has done nothing but help Democratic campaigns and causes,” Dworkin said. “Our group’s messaging has driven billions of impressions over the years and we have built a massive megaphone to help amplify our allies, which we will continue to utilize for years to come.”\n Dworkin argued that the nature of the Democratic Coalition’s work doesn’t translate well into FEC’s reporting requirements. “Because we are active on social networks on a daily basis, it requires relentless activity from our team, and so most of our expenses are labor related,” he said.\n Moreover, he added, “generating organic activity for candidates doesn’t meet the reporting requirement of buying a paid advertisement because it is based on earned social media reach.”\n In the case of the Fetterman video, Dworkin said the objective was “to fire up base voters in Pennsylvania,” and that the video’s accompanying hashtag, #VoteFetterman, “peaked at #8 nationally” on Twitter. It cost the Democratic Coalition $2,000 to produce the ad, he argued. He compared that to a campaign that would have likely paid six figures to have a “Twitter takeover.”\n Dworkin said the super PAC raised only $280 off the video, which asked viewers to “donate today and help us show this awesome Fetterman ad to swing voters in Pennsylvania.” He defended the solicitation by noting the group also fired off a tweet to its over half-million followers containing a link to donate directly to Fetterman’s campaign. That tweet came before McPhillips went after the group\n Though Fetterman’s campaign cast the group as a scam PAC, there are no legal requirements that spell out what percentage of a PAC’s spending must be put toward politicking — or paying their employees.\n That ambiguity has allowed political action committees to engage in conduct ranging from apparent self-dealing to actual fraud, which the federal government has only recently begun to mobilize in earnest to combat.\n Such activity has flourished on both the left and right, growing serious enough to trigger a warning from the FBI in 2021 urging would-be donors to be on the lookout for such schemes, calling disbursements to vendors associated with a PAC’s operators “a red flag.”\n Still, “for First Amendment reasons and others, PACs have a fair amount of flexibility in how they spend their money,” said Erin Chlopak, senior director for campaign finance at the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, who pointed out that “frankly, it does cost money … to run ads and support candidates and so fundraising is a legitimate part of PAC activity.”\n That makes it hard to police the issue, and means that it’s mainly up to donors to determine where they want to send their money. Last year, the FEC heard recommendations from a working group on how best to address the issue. Most of the proposals centered around ensuring donors are better informed about the political activities of the committee they’re interested in donating to. The campaign finance watchdog has yet to vote on any of the proposals.\n In the absence of regulation, politicians have sometimes taken it upon themselves to try and block other groups from trying to profit off their name and likeness — even when the group in question is an ally. Just last year, the Republican National Committee rebuffed a cease-and-desist demand from former President Donald Trump to stop its “unauthorized use of President Donald J. Trump’s name, image, and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech.”\n A senior Fetterman aide declined to comment on the record as to whether the campaign has any intention to issue such a request to the Democratic Coalition but said that “we’ve been clear on telling this group to go fuck themselves.”","dc:creator":"Caitlin Oprysko","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/5d/ca/c0ce66d04d6397cb3ccfd9872c12/election-2022-pennsylvania-senate-35733.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Matt Rourke/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Super PACs are barred by campaign finance laws from contributing directly to candidates like John Fetterman or coordinating with their campaigns.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/5d/ca/c0ce66d04d6397cb3ccfd9872c12/election-2022-pennsylvania-senate-35733.jpg"}}]},"content":"The super PAC, Democratic Coalition, has been previously accused of self dealing.

To do so, Washington threatened to use a tool known as “secondary sanctions,” which presented foreign banks and companies with a stark choice: They could do business with the United States or Iran, but not both. The vast majority chose the United States and ceased business with Iran.</p> <p>This campaign would not have been possible without Congress. It was Congress that passed hard-hitting laws requiring secondary sanctions, starting with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, which threatened penalties on foreign financial institutions that continued to deal with Iranian banks. When Obama administration officials urged foreign governments and firms to cut ties with Iran, this legislation provided them with essential leverage. With Congress as the “bad cop,” the Obama administration could play hardball on global sanctions implementation while retaining good diplomatic relations.</p> <p>The most important of these congressional initiatives came in late 2011, when Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) secured an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that threatened secondary sanctions against buyers of Iranian oil. At the urging of the Obama administration, the amendment also included a clause that provided exemptions for countries that significantly reduced their oil purchases from Iran every six months. This gave the Obama administration leeway to secure gradual reductions of Iranian oil purchases from countries such as China, India and Turkey. A few months later, Congress strengthened the law by requiring payments for Iran’s oil to flow into restricted offshore accounts, where the money could only be used for bilateral trade or for humanitarian purchases.</p> <p>It was these ingenious sanctions that throttled Iran’s economy in 2012 — the first year Iran suffered a recession since the early 1990s — and brought Tehran to the nuclear negotiating table. And while the Obama administration implemented the sanctions skillfully, the White House originally opposed them.

There’s little doubt the EU decision was sped up by Congress’ overwhelming support for secondary oil sanctions.</p> <p>In retrospect, the Menendez-Kirk amendment played a critical role in pressuring Tehran by hitting the core of Iran’s economy — its energy revenues. Like Russia’s energy sector today, Iran’s had been spared heavy sanctions up until that point.

Within days of Vladimir Putin’s declaration of war in February, the United States galvanized the world’s leading democracies to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia’s financial sector, including the country’s central bank — the largest sanctions target in recent history.\n From the beginning of the campaign, the United States and its allies moved carefully in one key area: energy. Russia is a petro-state, dependent on oil and gas sales for two-thirds of its export revenues and half of its budget. But with global oil prices high and inflation afflicting much of the West, Washington and Brussels have been reluctant to take actions that could nudge oil prices — and inflation — still higher.\n Early in the war, Washington banned domestic imports of Russian oil. Still, to ensure that sanctions didn’t inadvertently curb the flow of Russian oil to other countries, the Biden administration issued a license that exempts Russia’s energy sales from the thicket of U.S. restrictions. This exemption has allowed the Kremlin to continue to rake in billionsfrom oil exports as its armies perpetrated untold atrocities in Ukraine. In December, that license will finally expire, and the United States and its allies will begin enforcing a price cap on Russia’s oil exports.\n Given that sanctions have thus far spared the Kremlin’s main source of cash, it’s remarkable they’ve been so impactful. The IMF projects Russia’s economy will contract by 6 percent this year and another 3.5 percent next year. If the IMF forecast proves accurate, this year’s fall would eclipse that of the devastating 1998 Russian financial crisis — and it would even exceed the hit Iran’s economy took during the peak of international sanctions against that country, in 2012.\n It’s also remarkable the West has mustered this much pressure without support from one of the world’s most fearsome sanctioners: the U.S. Congress.\n Congress has played a major role in providing support to Ukraine’s war effort. But it has largely held back on Russia sanctions. For the West’s campaign against Russia’s oil sales to work, that needs to change.\n The most successful sanctions campaign in modern times offers a blueprint: the U.S. effort to constrict Iran’s economy in the leadup to the 2015 nuclear deal. During the George W. Bush administration, the United States led a worldwide push to shut Iran out of the global financial system. President Barack Obama inherited the effort and took it to new heights, implementing a global strategy that cut Iran’s oil exports by more than half and locked up over $100 billion of its energy proceeds in restricted bank accounts overseas.\n As the United States had enforced a domestic embargo on Iran since the 1990s, the only way to pressure Tehran’s finances was to influence how the rest of the world did business with Iran. To do so, Washington threatened to use a tool known as “secondary sanctions,” which presented foreign banks and companies with a stark choice: They could do business with the United States or Iran, but not both. The vast majority chose the United States and ceased business with Iran.\n This campaign would not have been possible without Congress. It was Congress that passed hard-hitting laws requiring secondary sanctions, starting with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, which threatened penalties on foreign financial institutions that continued to deal with Iranian banks. When Obama administration officials urged foreign governments and firms to cut ties with Iran, this legislation provided them with essential leverage. With Congress as the “bad cop,” the Obama administration could play hardball on global sanctions implementation while retaining good diplomatic relations.\n The most important of these congressional initiatives came in late 2011, when Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) secured an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that threatened secondary sanctions against buyers of Iranian oil. At the urging of the Obama administration, the amendment also included a clause that provided exemptions for countries that significantly reduced their oil purchases from Iran every six months. This gave the Obama administration leeway to secure gradual reductions of Iranian oil purchases from countries such as China, India and Turkey. A few months later, Congress strengthened the law by requiring payments for Iran’s oil to flow into restricted offshore accounts, where the money could only be used for bilateral trade or for humanitarian purchases.\n It was these ingenious sanctions that throttled Iran’s economy in 2012 — the first year Iran suffered a recession since the early 1990s — and brought Tehran to the nuclear negotiating table. And while the Obama administration implemented the sanctions skillfully, the White House originally opposed them. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner went so far as to write a letter opposing the amendment, just hours before it passed the Senate by a whopping 100-0 vote.\n It is natural for the executive branch to bristle at congressional forays into sanctions policy. Sanctions have become a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy, and presidents of both parties have generally not appreciated efforts by Congress to intrude.\n But the historical record shows that, more often than not, congressional sanctions actually strengthen the president’s hand. In the case of the Menendez-Kirk amendment, the European Union followed up just a few days later with an oil embargo on Iran of its own. There’s little doubt the EU decision was sped up by Congress’ overwhelming support for secondary oil sanctions.\n In retrospect, the Menendez-Kirk amendment played a critical role in pressuring Tehran by hitting the core of Iran’s economy — its energy revenues. Like Russia’s energy sector today, Iran’s had been spared heavy sanctions up until that point. The brilliance of Menendez-Kirk was that it combined legally mandated sanctions with flexibility that allowed the Obama administration to find the best approach for implementation.\n The price cap on Russian oil that will go into effect in December is the most ambitious use of sanctions since the Menendez-Kirk amendment. Securing international support for this policy — which the Biden administration had been pushing for months — was a remarkable feat of diplomatic persistence. But even though the policy is backed by the G7, which accounts for nearly half of global GDP, there are concerns that firms in China, India and other countries that don’t enforce sanctions on Russia could undermine the price cap by making side paymentsto Russia or developing supply chains that avoid Western companies entirely. OPEC’s decision last week to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day will push up oil prices and heighten these concerns.\n The price cap is a first-of-its-kind sanction — a descendant of the 2012 Iran oil sanctions, to be sure, but harder to implement and aimed at a much bigger oil producer. The best way to ensure its success is for Congress to act as well and back up the administration. By requiring secondary sanctions on anyone that violates the price cap, Congress can give the Biden administration the stick it needs to make the policy work.\n Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) recently put forward an amendmentto this year’s defense bill that would do just that. It contains an unambiguous requirement to impose secondary sanctions on violators of the price cap while giving the Biden administration flexibility to flesh out the details.

Two days later, the crime scene was outside his Long Island home.\n A random drive-by shooting on Sunday, when his 16-year-old twin daughters were inside the house, rocked the New York governor's race and marked the second time this election season that violence has hit close to home for Zeldin. In July, a troubled veteran attacked the congressman on stage during a campaign rally in Rochester.\n Zeldin and his family were unhurt in the incidents, but the events have elevated Zeldin's tough-on-crime campaign message just weeks before he faces Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in the Nov. 8 election.

She also strengthened gun-control laws — though they were partially overturned in June by the Supreme Court.\n Hochul has also seen tension within her own party over crime: Left-leaning Democrats have long wanted to provide more rights to those accused of crimes while moderates like New York City Mayor Eric Adams are pressing her to toughen laws.

Beijing’s delays could just be a way to needle the administration ahead of formalizing the meeting, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonprofit Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Right now, the Biden administration appears more eager for this meeting than Beijing, so China has little incentive to agree to one on either Washington’s terms or timetable,” Singleton said. “Better instead to make the White House sweat, even if for only a few more weeks.”</p> <p>The Chinese government’s reluctance to finalize a meeting agenda may also reflect Beijing’s desire to delay

The individual was granted anonymity to prevent possible reprisals for speaking publicly about the bilateral spat.\n The Chinese embassy didn’t respond to a request for comment. The White House denied any problems in negotiating the planned Biden-Xi meeting.\n “This story is 100 percent false,” the National Security Council’s top spokesperson, Adrienne Watson, said in an email. “We’ve already said the two presidents tasked out their teams to look into a meeting. I won't get beyond that though in terms of timing and location as of now.”\n Preparations for a possible Biden-Xi meeting began months ago. The White Houseannounced in July following Biden’s most recent call with Xi that both sides had agreed on “the value of meeting face to face” and would determine a “mutually agreeable time to do so.” China’s foreign ministry dispatched a delegation to Indonesia in August to prepare for the meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 in Bali.\n But with only a month until the G-20 meeting opens in Bali, uncertainty about whether Biden will get a one-on-one meeting with Xi is becoming a diplomatic cliffhanger. “It is still not confirmed,” said a Washington-based diplomat familiar with the event’s planning. The diplomat was granted anonymity because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.\n \n \n The meeting is key to the Biden administration effort — outlined in this week’s National Security Strategy — to find ways to cooperate with China in areas like climate change at the same time that it hammers the country with export restrictions and mobilizes allies to counter China’s increasingly aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific.\n China so far hasn’t been up for that kind of frenemy. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit in August, China began regularly flying fighter jets across the halfway point in the waters between China and the self-governing island, and cut off cooperation with the U.S. in areas including counternarcotics and addressing the climate crisis.\n The U.S. has responded in kind. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved legislation in September to boost Taiwan’s ability to defend itself against a potential Chinese invasion. And in just the past week the administration restricted semiconductor exports to China, issued a National Security Strategy that painted China as one of the biggest threats to U.S. security and warned China may pursue “weaponization of trade as a tool of geopolitical coercion.”\n Beijing has been particularly roiled by that National Security Strategy, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement Thursday.\n “The China-related content of the U.S. National Security Strategy hypes up major-power competition, zero-sum game and ideological confrontation,” he wrote. “The sole purpose is to contain and suppress China’s development and maintain the U.S. hegemony.”\n \n That anger is heightening Chinese government skepticism about the utility of a Xi-Biden in-person meeting, but hasn’t yet completely scuppered it, said John Kamm, whose role as the founder of the nonprofit Dui Hua Foundation provides him regular access to Chinese diplomats.\n “Based on soundings with Chinese officials, a meeting is expected but details haven’t been agreed to,” Kamm said. “They are wary of more surprises like the semiconductor decision, about which they are furious.”\n Still, Beijing’s delays could just be a way to needle the administration ahead of formalizing the meeting, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonprofit Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Right now, the Biden administration appears more eager for this meeting than Beijing, so China has little incentive to agree to one on either Washington’s terms or timetable,” Singleton said. “Better instead to make the White House sweat, even if for only a few more weeks.”\n The Chinese government’s reluctance to finalize a meeting agenda may also reflect Beijing’s desire to delay confirmation of major diplomatic outreach until the conclusion of the Chinese Communist Party’s 20th Party Congress. The Congress, which opens on Sunday, will likely deliver Xi a five-year extension as CCP General Secretary and pave the way for possible ruler-for-life status.\n “We'll know more when the 20th Party Congress ends, but if [Chinese officials] still keep dissing us, that’s serious,” said the person briefed by Chinese officials on the Xi-Biden meeting planning.\n \n But both leaders will likely have an opportunity for in-person discussions in Bali regardless of whether they have a formal meeting agenda.\n “They're going to be in the same room for at least 36 hours … they're not going to ignore each other and glare at each other over the table,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “Semiconductors are important, but they're going to find a way to communicate.”","dc:creator":"Phelim Kine","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/63/627eca264c21b4902e48931b651c/us-china-79841.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Alex Brandon, Eraldo Peres/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely have an opportunity for in-person discussions in Bali regardless of whether they have a formal meeting agenda.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/63/627eca264c21b4902e48931b651c/us-china-79841.jpg"}}]},"content":"Chinese officials are stonewalling on an agenda for the meeting in protest over Biden's recent actions against the country.","contentSnippet":"Chinese officials are stonewalling on an agenda for the meeting in protest over Biden's recent actions against the country.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/biden-xi-meeting-g20-00061919","isoDate":"2022-10-14T19:29:35.000Z"}]}
