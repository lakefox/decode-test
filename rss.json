But young voters have contributed to a smaller fraction of that turnout compared to this time two years ago, according to interviews and a POLITICO analysis of voter data.\n The party has had high hopes that younger voters motivated by the Supreme Court’s scuttling of abortion rights and President Joe Biden’s cancellation of some student debt would turn out in force — and help them to defy losses that the party in power typically suffers in midterm elections. They could still show up to the polls on Election Day. But their disappearance from the ranks of early voters so far puts Democrats at a disadvantage, because the party still has to chase their votes instead of banking them ahead of Nov. 8.\n In North Carolina, which has a close U.S. Senate race and a set of state legislative races that could determine whether abortion remains legal in the state, the median age of voters who cast ballots through Oct. 26 was 66, according to state data. Voters aged 30 and younger account for just 5.4 percent of ballots cast so far, compared to 16.5 percent of those who voted early or absentee in 2020. Republicans’ share of the early vote is also slightly higher now than it was at the same time two years ago.\n \n \n The overall situation looks better for Democrats in Pennsylvania, where they have maintained a more than 50-point advantage in absentee ballots returned so far, a similar share to 2020.

To succeed, according to policymakers, the U.S. will have to “shape what comes next.”</p> <p>Shaping what comes next isn’t as sweeping a vision as, say, “realigning” the Middle East, which was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s goal 15 years ago. Nor is it as fanciful as the guidance pitched in 1962 by Kennedy’s national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, when he said the U.S. could crush the Viet Cong in Indochina with U.S. casualties no greater than the annual traffic-related injuries in Washington, D.C. It is consistent, however, with the longstanding — and dangerous — notion that the U.S. has far-reaching abilities to mold the world to its desires.</p> <p>America may have been temporarily chastened by failures in Afghanistan and Iraq, as it was after Vietnam. But there’s no reason that fresh, exuberant ill-judgements on the scale pushed by Rice and Bundy won’t again be made, and soon. After all, those deadly fiascos were just the worst blunders in decades of U.S. foreign policy miscalculation.</p> <p>Why do such bad ideas get injected into the making of U.S. foreign policy, particularly with an ease rarely found in other advanced democracies?</p> <p>Much is due to the political appointments system which the country uses to staff its government, including the national security apparatus. The White House has the responsibility to fill roughly 4,000 senior jobs throughout the federal departments and agencies. When it comes to roles concerning foreign policy and defense, such appointees from outside the executive branch often have more experience in academia, law firms or in business than on the front lines of world affairs. (The same method is applied to staffing at other departments, like Commerce and HUD — except bad ideas at Commerce or Labor are unlikely to cause international catastrophe.)</p> <p>This freewheeling approach imposes inexperience, compels urgency, courts risk and foments illusions of being able to manage the ethnic, ideological and political concerns of other nations.</p> <p>“I didn’t think it would be <i>this</i> tough,” Rice concluded on Iraq, echoing Bundy who came to admit of Vietnam that “this damn war is much tougher” than he had anticipated. The system — in which Rice and Bundy, among so many others, have flourished — creates all the wrong incentives when devising foreign policy even as it raises the risk of being gamed by rivals overseas. Of course, not all appointees have such flaws, just like not all career officials have real foresight. But it’s difficult to see why the outcomes of jousting with China, waging proxy war against Russia and courting a showdown with Iran would be any better than the results of past turmoil.</p> <p>Furthermore, the problem with the system of political patronage goes deep: The influence of cabinet members and nearly all ambassadors can be secondary to that of their subordinates who structure and execute decisions day-to-day at State, the Pentagon and on the NSC staff. Unlike in any other serious country, these hands-on operating roles of government are all open to political patronage, including key positions affecting war and peace: undersecretary of defense for policy, counselor at the State Department, assistant secretary of defense for international security, ones at State for political-military affairs. Also in the mix are assistant and deputy assistant secretaries in both departments for all regions of the globe. Various office directors and senior staff add their weight.</p> <p>Some slots require Senate confirmation; most not. Appointees from outside federal departments and agencies may be fewer in one administration, more so in another. But the result is always a kaleidoscope of new arrivals and random talents. Meanwhile, embers are drifting down on powder kegs.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\">The Rise of Foreign Policy Amateurism</h3> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\"></h3> <p>America wasn’t always so reckless in the world. It took Kennedy’s thousand days in office to make incaution systemic.</p> <p>Certainly, the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had made plenty of mistakes before him, and Korea — with its disastrous counter-invasion to “liberate” the North — had already been the first of what by today adds up to four failed wars in a row. (1991’s one-hundred-hour Gulf War was a high-tech, tactical win over a ruinously self-exposed army of conscripts.) But under JFK’s presidency, insobriety reached a new level. Suddenly, assassination and nuclear brinkmanship were tools of policy while the number of strategic missiles and bombers on alert doubled. And he boasted of increasing special forces in Vietnam by 600 percent.</p> <p>Why the sudden shift? During the Kennedy presidency, every form of U.S. military power was multiplied. Appointee positions expanded geometrically, and vigorous men of all backgrounds quickly filled them. Professors, previously for the most part advisers to the departments dealing with national defense, suddenly became line practitioners. Kennedy moved his national security adviser — Bundy, who appointed people of his own — into the West Wing and promised a “long twilight struggle year in and year out” against ruthless, godless tyranny. The youthful and energetic men who came to power in January 1961 saw few limits and acted accordingly.</p> <p>Later administrations kept the illusions of what U.S. political-military clout could accomplish, along with the habit of deploying professors and think tankers in hands-on roles, with no better results. To be sure, great accomplishments have surrounded the many self-deceptions. America defeated the Soviet empire, created sound alliances and had a short, focused, effective intervention in Kosovo, as in Kuwait. Yet the record as a whole is chilling: not just the failed wars but all the befriending of murderous sheiks and shahs, an illusory détente in the 1970s that buttressed Soviet Russia, to be followed in the 80s by upholding Saddam Hussein, later capped by nation-building in places where nations barely existed. And worst of all, the country keeps repeating its follies on a colossal scale.</p> <p>Today, the Office of Presidential Personnel fills about 635 jobs at State and Defense, and several hundred more at Homeland Security and elsewhere that address foreign policy. At the NSC, which has a staff over 300, roughly 20 percent of the most senior people are appointed, the rest being detailed from the military and a range of government agencies.</p> <p>Stephen Hadley, who succeeded Rice in 2005 as national security adviser, defended this approach after a lecture I gave in Washington, in 2019, on foreign policy shortfalls. Much is due to the executive branch structure’s depending on one figure being in charge. Accordingly, a president most effectively exercises power by personalizing the instruments of state right down to the level of daily implementation — especially in foreign affairs where, constitutionally, the president has vast latitude.</p> <p>Basically, in this view, spirited, clever and well-schooled individuals then get pulled into the system. They are people like current national security adviser Jake Sullivan, a lawyer who had entered government in 2009, becoming Vice President Joe Biden’s chief national security aide; he then spent four years teaching and policy consulting during the Trump years, until Biden became president. Or like Rice, who in 2001 returned to Washington for a second stint in government — having spent two years at the NSC during the George H. W. Bush presidency — after a decade at Stanford. And people like Bundy too, who was new to public life when coming to Washington at the start of the Kennedy administration, after a dozen years teaching at Harvard.</p> <p>Hadley also rose in this system where “outsiders” turn into “insiders” with each election cycle. A Republican, he had worked as an analyst at the NSC from 1974-1977, then practiced law in Washington until, in 1989, he served as a Pentagon assistant secretary for three and a half years under the first President Bush. Another long stint of lawyering followed until the second President Bush appointed him deputy NSC adviser in 2001. Hadley proved instrumental to making the case for invading Iraq in 2003, and, so qualified, he succeeded Rice.</p> <p>These representative careers are emulated by other men and women with establishment credentials, stellar political networks and ambitions to enter America’s civilian national security cohort, or to attain foreign policy roles in general. They arrive from law firms, universities, think tanks, congressional offices, business and journalism, and they include former career professionals who’ve left government, then to return with political backing. In all, the actual number of years they serve in the executive branch is low compared to Foreign Service officers and civil servants who’ve risen in the merit-based ranks.</p> <p>Before her star turn in Congress, Liz Cheney personified the existing foreign policy approach in which the job description needn’t include experience. She graduated from law school in 1996 and, being politically connected, got appointed in 2002 as a deputy assistant secretary of State. Her remit was the Near East, and, knowing zero about the region, she landed in the middle of calamity.</p> <p>It’s a unique approach. In Europe, Japan, Brazil, Russia and China, ministries are filled instead by permanent, though frequently rotating, career officials. Career diplomats and foreign policy professionals hold important roles sometimes effectively up to cabinet level.</p> <p>Ideally, the Washington way assures a valuable tension between an administration’s more original, politically-savvy appointees — alert to the short term — and an ongoing, knowledgeable, inherited staff attuned to longer challenges. However, what ends up happening in practice is that the country’s civil service and Foreign Service are diminished: Political appointees from outside the federal departments, relatively untried on the frontlines, tend to hold the decisive, career-enhancing roles like deputy assistant secretary and above. Chances of serious misjudgment increase.</p> <p>Part of the tragedy is that most anyone whose life included years of mediating between warlords in N’Djamena, or equally dismal tasks during decades of actual responsibility, could have told professors Rice or Bundy that war was going to be “tough,” and could have said so before the thousands of body bags started arriving home.</p> <p>That sort of gritty, practical, career-long experience exemplifies the Foreign Service, among other parts of the federal merit-based hierarchy. It fosters an expertise that’s hard to acquire elsewhere, even if a lawyer or professor or think tank researcher has more than one or two forays into government.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/25/6a/61b1a3254ef880d3d48192cb10ca/robert-mcnamara-aphs237370.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\">The Price of Inexperience</h3> <p>Questions of relevant, practical experience among many political appointees is one of several problems with the patronage system.</p> <p>During 2001, for example, the Bush administration’s new undersecretary of defense for policy — a huge job that involved managing the Defense department’s international relations — arrived from a six-man law firm. In his memoirs written after he left for a think tank in 2005, this recent enthusiast for invading Iraq and thereby transforming the Middle East derided the country’s diplomats for their inclination to “fret about the risk” of war.</p> <p>Forty years earlier, it was Bundy — with no more useful experience than this undersecretary — who mocked the professionals at State for lacking “energy” when harsh decisions of escalation and regime change had to be made on Vietnam. Unsurprisingly, in the run-ups to both Iraq and Vietnam, it tended to be those experienced, long-serving professionals — men and women required to know something of history, foreign cultures and languages — who doubted that America could recast entire cultures overnight.</p> <p>A second limitation arises from the relatively short stints in government among these appointees. Institutional memory becomes spotty as they come and go. Those confirmed by the Senate stay in office for an average of 17 months. Below them, others may serve slightly longer, before returning to private life. It’s a form of unplanned obsolescence.</p> <p>One Washington lawyer, who had been appointed a deputy assistant secretary at State during Bill Clinton’s presidency, before returning to practice in 2000, genially admitted he was years behind the cable traffic when President Barack Obama designated him Special Envoy for Libya.</p> <p>A system which depends heavily on short-term officeholders imposes a sense of urgency on itself. And urgency is dangerous when, say, negotiating arms accords — or deciding just how to evacuate Kabul or Saigon. Appointees — often focused, clever and determined people — are able to push their priorities through bureaucracies that are less certain or obsessed. These officials may be comparative amateurs. Yet they must act right now before competing urgencies are tabled, or their administration is swept from office.</p> <p>A third limitation of many appointees — shared by cabinet members — is the recurring belief that America can pretty much shape entire geostrategic environments, like the one around Beijing.</p> <p>All that’s needed to succeed are enough resources and zeal, combined with the quintessential American science of management. Surely “every problem can be solved,” believed Robert McNamara, the Ford Motor Company president who served as secretary of Defense during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, from 1961-1967. The problem wasn’t just McNamara’s conceit: He staffed the Pentagon with what the press called “whiz kids” from Harvard, Stanford, RAND who shared his conviction. Desperate to thwart the devouring incubus of China, the country then applied these certitudes to Vietnam.</p> <p>Today, after a debacle with many similarities, retired General David Petraeus — always politically attuned, and sounding like a just-appointed assistant secretary — writes of what should have been done to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/08/us-withdrawal-afghanistan-strategy-shortcomings/670980/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“manage” Afghanistan on a “sustained, generational” scale&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/08/us-withdrawal-afghanistan-strategy-shortcomings/670980/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71690000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71690001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">“manage” Afghanistan on a “sustained, generational” scale</a>. Words like that say a lot, and they parrot a half-century of high civilian officials. This isn’t merely shorthand for a robust foreign policy. It’s a small step to assuming that Asia or the Middle East can be smoothly administered, or fine-tuned, if the right tools are applied.</p> <p>Here too a difference has long existed with professional diplomats who are skilled in non-coercive persuasion. Seldom are Foreign Service Officers, who are frequently marginalized anyway from the big decisions, to be found among the “global architects” of whom novelist<i> John le Carré</i> writes. Those are officials at the top who are busily crafting “a secret tuck here, and a secret pull there… and a destabilized economy or two” to save democracy everywhere.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2a/42/41c78e5c49cf931829b03142c05d/trump-bolton-48649.jpg\"> <br> <h3 style=\"text-align: left\">The Danger of “Emergency Men”</h3> <p>Worst of all, the appointee system is a gateway to power for a certain type of political figure. These are people whom the opportunities offered by the modern state tempt into an eternal trifling with danger and extremity. And it’s to the excitements of war and peace that they are drawn. Nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt called them “emergency men,” and the genre has abounded in Washington.</p> <p>During the discussion with Hadley, he asked me what I meant by “fine-tuning.” A successor of his, John Bolton, who served 18 months under President Donald Trump, offers an example. Bolton is a true amateur, and fits Burckhardt’s description. He’s spent only 14 divvied up years of a nearly five-decade career working on these matters in government.

How could results be otherwise?<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"The Biden administration recently unveiled a new national security strategy with grand aims for U.S. foreign policy: to win the global contest against autocracy, particularly an increasingly dangerous Russia and China. To succeed, according to policymakers, the U.S. will have to “shape what comes next.”\n Shaping what comes next isn’t as sweeping a vision as, say, “realigning” the Middle East, which was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s goal 15 years ago. Nor is it as fanciful as the guidance pitched in 1962 by Kennedy’s national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, when he said the U.S. could crush the Viet Cong in Indochina with U.S. casualties no greater than the annual traffic-related injuries in Washington, D.C. It is consistent, however, with the longstanding — and dangerous — notion that the U.S. has far-reaching abilities to mold the world to its desires.\n America may have been temporarily chastened by failures in Afghanistan and Iraq, as it was after Vietnam. But there’s no reason that fresh, exuberant ill-judgements on the scale pushed by Rice and Bundy won’t again be made, and soon. After all, those deadly fiascos were just the worst blunders in decades of U.S. foreign policy miscalculation.\n Why do such bad ideas get injected into the making of U.S. foreign policy, particularly with an ease rarely found in other advanced democracies?\n Much is due to the political appointments system which the country uses to staff its government, including the national security apparatus. The White House has the responsibility to fill roughly 4,000 senior jobs throughout the federal departments and agencies. When it comes to roles concerning foreign policy and defense, such appointees from outside the executive branch often have more experience in academia, law firms or in business than on the front lines of world affairs. (The same method is applied to staffing at other departments, like Commerce and HUD — except bad ideas at Commerce or Labor are unlikely to cause international catastrophe.)\n This freewheeling approach imposes inexperience, compels urgency, courts risk and foments illusions of being able to manage the ethnic, ideological and political concerns of other nations.\n “I didn’t think it would be this tough,” Rice concluded on Iraq, echoing Bundy who came to admit of Vietnam that “this damn war is much tougher” than he had anticipated. The system — in which Rice and Bundy, among so many others, have flourished — creates all the wrong incentives when devising foreign policy even as it raises the risk of being gamed by rivals overseas. Of course, not all appointees have such flaws, just like not all career officials have real foresight. But it’s difficult to see why the outcomes of jousting with China, waging proxy war against Russia and courting a showdown with Iran would be any better than the results of past turmoil.\n Furthermore, the problem with the system of political patronage goes deep: The influence of cabinet members and nearly all ambassadors can be secondary to that of their subordinates who structure and execute decisions day-to-day at State, the Pentagon and on the NSC staff. Unlike in any other serious country, these hands-on operating roles of government are all open to political patronage, including key positions affecting war and peace: undersecretary of defense for policy, counselor at the State Department, assistant secretary of defense for international security, ones at State for political-military affairs. Also in the mix are assistant and deputy assistant secretaries in both departments for all regions of the globe. Various office directors and senior staff add their weight.\n Some slots require Senate confirmation; most not. Appointees from outside federal departments and agencies may be fewer in one administration, more so in another. But the result is always a kaleidoscope of new arrivals and random talents. Meanwhile, embers are drifting down on powder kegs.\n The Rise of Foreign Policy Amateurism\n \n America wasn’t always so reckless in the world. It took Kennedy’s thousand days in office to make incaution systemic.\n Certainly, the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had made plenty of mistakes before him, and Korea — with its disastrous counter-invasion to “liberate” the North — had already been the first of what by today adds up to four failed wars in a row. (1991’s one-hundred-hour Gulf War was a high-tech, tactical win over a ruinously self-exposed army of conscripts.) But under JFK’s presidency, insobriety reached a new level. Suddenly, assassination and nuclear brinkmanship were tools of policy while the number of strategic missiles and bombers on alert doubled. And he boasted of increasing special forces in Vietnam by 600 percent.\n Why the sudden shift? During the Kennedy presidency, every form of U.S. military power was multiplied. Appointee positions expanded geometrically, and vigorous men of all backgrounds quickly filled them. Professors, previously for the most part advisers to the departments dealing with national defense, suddenly became line practitioners. Kennedy moved his national security adviser — Bundy, who appointed people of his own — into the West Wing and promised a “long twilight struggle year in and year out” against ruthless, godless tyranny. The youthful and energetic men who came to power in January 1961 saw few limits and acted accordingly.\n Later administrations kept the illusions of what U.S. political-military clout could accomplish, along with the habit of deploying professors and think tankers in hands-on roles, with no better results. To be sure, great accomplishments have surrounded the many self-deceptions. America defeated the Soviet empire, created sound alliances and had a short, focused, effective intervention in Kosovo, as in Kuwait. Yet the record as a whole is chilling: not just the failed wars but all the befriending of murderous sheiks and shahs, an illusory détente in the 1970s that buttressed Soviet Russia, to be followed in the 80s by upholding Saddam Hussein, later capped by nation-building in places where nations barely existed. And worst of all, the country keeps repeating its follies on a colossal scale.\n Today, the Office of Presidential Personnel fills about 635 jobs at State and Defense, and several hundred more at Homeland Security and elsewhere that address foreign policy. At the NSC, which has a staff over 300, roughly 20 percent of the most senior people are appointed, the rest being detailed from the military and a range of government agencies.\n Stephen Hadley, who succeeded Rice in 2005 as national security adviser, defended this approach after a lecture I gave in Washington, in 2019, on foreign policy shortfalls. Much is due to the executive branch structure’s depending on one figure being in charge. Accordingly, a president most effectively exercises power by personalizing the instruments of state right down to the level of daily implementation — especially in foreign affairs where, constitutionally, the president has vast latitude.\n Basically, in this view, spirited, clever and well-schooled individuals then get pulled into the system. They are people like current national security adviser Jake Sullivan, a lawyer who had entered government in 2009, becoming Vice President Joe Biden’s chief national security aide; he then spent four years teaching and policy consulting during the Trump years, until Biden became president. Or like Rice, who in 2001 returned to Washington for a second stint in government — having spent two years at the NSC during the George H. W. Bush presidency — after a decade at Stanford. And people like Bundy too, who was new to public life when coming to Washington at the start of the Kennedy administration, after a dozen years teaching at Harvard.\n Hadley also rose in this system where “outsiders” turn into “insiders” with each election cycle. A Republican, he had worked as an analyst at the NSC from 1974-1977, then practiced law in Washington until, in 1989, he served as a Pentagon assistant secretary for three and a half years under the first President Bush. Another long stint of lawyering followed until the second President Bush appointed him deputy NSC adviser in 2001. Hadley proved instrumental to making the case for invading Iraq in 2003, and, so qualified, he succeeded Rice.\n These representative careers are emulated by other men and women with establishment credentials, stellar political networks and ambitions to enter America’s civilian national security cohort, or to attain foreign policy roles in general. They arrive from law firms, universities, think tanks, congressional offices, business and journalism, and they include former career professionals who’ve left government, then to return with political backing. In all, the actual number of years they serve in the executive branch is low compared to Foreign Service officers and civil servants who’ve risen in the merit-based ranks.\n Before her star turn in Congress, Liz Cheney personified the existing foreign policy approach in which the job description needn’t include experience. She graduated from law school in 1996 and, being politically connected, got appointed in 2002 as a deputy assistant secretary of State. Her remit was the Near East, and, knowing zero about the region, she landed in the middle of calamity.\n It’s a unique approach. In Europe, Japan, Brazil, Russia and China, ministries are filled instead by permanent, though frequently rotating, career officials. Career diplomats and foreign policy professionals hold important roles sometimes effectively up to cabinet level.\n Ideally, the Washington way assures a valuable tension between an administration’s more original, politically-savvy appointees — alert to the short term — and an ongoing, knowledgeable, inherited staff attuned to longer challenges. However, what ends up happening in practice is that the country’s civil service and Foreign Service are diminished: Political appointees from outside the federal departments, relatively untried on the frontlines, tend to hold the decisive, career-enhancing roles like deputy assistant secretary and above. Chances of serious misjudgment increase.\n Part of the tragedy is that most anyone whose life included years of mediating between warlords in N’Djamena, or equally dismal tasks during decades of actual responsibility, could have told professors Rice or Bundy that war was going to be “tough,” and could have said so before the thousands of body bags started arriving home.\n That sort of gritty, practical, career-long experience exemplifies the Foreign Service, among other parts of the federal merit-based hierarchy. It fosters an expertise that’s hard to acquire elsewhere, even if a lawyer or professor or think tank researcher has more than one or two forays into government.\n \n  \n The Price of Inexperience\n Questions of relevant, practical experience among many political appointees is one of several problems with the patronage system.\n During 2001, for example, the Bush administration’s new undersecretary of defense for policy — a huge job that involved managing the Defense department’s international relations — arrived from a six-man law firm. In his memoirs written after he left for a think tank in 2005, this recent enthusiast for invading Iraq and thereby transforming the Middle East derided the country’s diplomats for their inclination to “fret about the risk” of war.\n Forty years earlier, it was Bundy — with no more useful experience than this undersecretary — who mocked the professionals at State for lacking “energy” when harsh decisions of escalation and regime change had to be made on Vietnam. Unsurprisingly, in the run-ups to both Iraq and Vietnam, it tended to be those experienced, long-serving professionals — men and women required to know something of history, foreign cultures and languages — who doubted that America could recast entire cultures overnight.\n A second limitation arises from the relatively short stints in government among these appointees. Institutional memory becomes spotty as they come and go. Those confirmed by the Senate stay in office for an average of 17 months. Below them, others may serve slightly longer, before returning to private life. It’s a form of unplanned obsolescence.\n One Washington lawyer, who had been appointed a deputy assistant secretary at State during Bill Clinton’s presidency, before returning to practice in 2000, genially admitted he was years behind the cable traffic when President Barack Obama designated him Special Envoy for Libya.\n A system which depends heavily on short-term officeholders imposes a sense of urgency on itself. And urgency is dangerous when, say, negotiating arms accords — or deciding just how to evacuate Kabul or Saigon. Appointees — often focused, clever and determined people — are able to push their priorities through bureaucracies that are less certain or obsessed. These officials may be comparative amateurs. Yet they must act right now before competing urgencies are tabled, or their administration is swept from office.\n A third limitation of many appointees — shared by cabinet members — is the recurring belief that America can pretty much shape entire geostrategic environments, like the one around Beijing.\n All that’s needed to succeed are enough resources and zeal, combined with the quintessential American science of management. Surely “every problem can be solved,” believed Robert McNamara, the Ford Motor Company president who served as secretary of Defense during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, from 1961-1967. The problem wasn’t just McNamara’s conceit: He staffed the Pentagon with what the press called “whiz kids” from Harvard, Stanford, RAND who shared his conviction. Desperate to thwart the devouring incubus of China, the country then applied these certitudes to Vietnam.\n Today, after a debacle with many similarities, retired General David Petraeus — always politically attuned, and sounding like a just-appointed assistant secretary — writes of what should have been done to “manage” Afghanistan on a “sustained, generational” scale. Words like that say a lot, and they parrot a half-century of high civilian officials. This isn’t merely shorthand for a robust foreign policy. It’s a small step to assuming that Asia or the Middle East can be smoothly administered, or fine-tuned, if the right tools are applied.\n Here too a difference has long existed with professional diplomats who are skilled in non-coercive persuasion. Seldom are Foreign Service Officers, who are frequently marginalized anyway from the big decisions, to be found among the “global architects” of whom novelist John le Carré writes. Those are officials at the top who are busily crafting “a secret tuck here, and a secret pull there… and a destabilized economy or two” to save democracy everywhere.\n \n  \n The Danger of “Emergency Men”\n Worst of all, the appointee system is a gateway to power for a certain type of political figure. These are people whom the opportunities offered by the modern state tempt into an eternal trifling with danger and extremity. And it’s to the excitements of war and peace that they are drawn. Nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt called them “emergency men,” and the genre has abounded in Washington.\n During the discussion with Hadley, he asked me what I meant by “fine-tuning.” A successor of his, John Bolton, who served 18 months under President Donald Trump, offers an example. Bolton is a true amateur, and fits Burckhardt’s description. He’s spent only 14 divvied up years of a nearly five-decade career working on these matters in government. Law firms, politicking, early domestic duties at the Justice Department and think tanks consumed his time. (Nor do TV interviews and op-eds issued from research centers compare to owning a problem while in office, however briefly.) Yet he tells of staging coups during stints of public service — pointless acts if even true, really, because there’s little chance that Washington will be able to control what comes next, whether Saigon in 1963 or Cairo in 2013, or who-knows-what tomorrow.\n To boast in 2022 of staging coups recalls another national security adviser who described himself in 1972 as “the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse, the cowboy who rides all alone into town.” Each man was daydreaming of uncanny abilities.\n Henry Kissinger held that slot at the time. President Richard Nixon, who knew much about foreign affairs, observed that Kissinger was one of those people who foment crises “to earn attention for themselves,” adding that the Harvard professor — in his first government job — would have set one off over someplace like Ecuador had Vietnam not been in play. Many crises did erupt, and worse: bungling in Cambodia and in Pakistan that abetted genocide, and so too in East Timor which he believed to be Muslim, not Catholic, and “in the middle of Indonesia,” plus bolstering a disastrous right-wing coup in Chile, just to begin. Meanwhile, Kissinger imitated Kennedy’s own NSC adviser, McGeorge Bundy. “The defect of the State Department is low energy,” he advised Nixon.\n As would Kissinger, Bundy embodied emergency: Any resolute action had to be superior to restraint.

The U.S. commander in Vietnam recalled Bundy developing a “field marshal psychosis,” and America then intervened big.\n Political appointees aren’t the only ones to blame. Generals, legislators, carefully sieved Foreign Service Officers and their counterparts in the civil service, as well as at CIA, can push foolish notions too. (CIA has few appointees, and its problems instead occur from a decades-long hermetic insularity.) It’s the brass, after all, which keeps assuring politicians that the silver bullets of airpower will deliver a decisive edge: drones in the Middle East, helicopters in Vietnam and B-29s in North Korea.

A spokesperson for the group said the ad — a negative spot against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan — is set to hit airwaves on Wednesday, and Sentinel may add to its buy.\n Jessica Anderson, president of the super PAC, called the Army brigadier general a “political outsider” whose vote was needed to reverse Democratic economic policies. The group endorsed Bolduc earlier this month, and prior to the Senate primary spent $300,000 on a July ad attacking Hassan on gas prices.\n “General Don Bolduc will be the senator New Hampshirites need in Washington,” Anderson said in a statement to POLITICO. “His campaign is showing tremendous momentum in the Granite State, and it is time for the whole of the conservative movement to come together and support his bid to unseat Sen. Hassan.”\n \n \n Bolduc’s rise in the polls — which now show him tied or within the margin of error against Hassan — comes as Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a week ago it was slashing more than $5 million in remaining ad buys in the state in order to spend the funds in Pennsylvania.\n Sentinel Action Fund’s venture into New Hampshire mirrors its involvement in Arizona. In both cases, the new super PAC sought to fill a void left by SLF’s departure. In the case of Arizona, Republican Blake Masters began catching up with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after Sentinel Action Fund and a series of other GOP outside spending groups rushed in to buy up advertising time that SLF had canceled.\n SLF’s announcement last week to cancel its remaining investment in New Hampshire came two days after Bolduc reiterated he would still not support McConnell as Senate majority leader, a position he held during the primary.\n In the story, first reported by POLITICO, Bolduc said he was “not backing off” his past comments about the need for new leadership in the Senate. Masters earlier this year had also suggested a change in Republican Senate leadership.\n In the days since, two new Republican senators have endorsed Bolduc: Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Early next week, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, will travel to New Hampshire to campaign with him.\n Bolduc, an Army brigadier general who ran further to the right than his Republican primary opponents, has attempted to temper some of his positions after winning the party’s nomination. That includes reversing his past stance that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump, who ultimately did not endorse in the New Hampshire Senate primary.\n \n \n An internal poll released last week by Bolduc’s campaign, conducted by Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio, found Bolduc just two points behind Hassan, 49 to 47 percent. An Emerson College poll also conducted in mid-October showed a three-point race, while a Co/Efficient poll this week had the race tied.\n The recent surveys show Bolduc has pulled closer to Hassan since just after the Sept. 13 primary, when he was polling 7 to 9 percentage points behind the incumbent Democrat.\n Coupled with a lingering poor midterm environment for Democrats — Biden’s approval stands at just 40 percent in the state, Emerson and Co/Efficient found — the recent polling has urged Republican groups to step in and keep irons in the fire in New Hampshire.\n The NRSC, which canceled millions of dollars in scheduled advertisements in New Hampshire earlier this month, citing SLF’s presence in the state, this week said it would put $1 million back in. Other GOP super PACs, including Our American Century and Restoration PAC, have placed buys in the last week totaling $1 million.\n But Democrats continue to have a spending advantage in the final days of the race. Through Election Day, Democrats have another $6.5 million worth of ads scheduled, according to AdImpact, compared to $1.3 million from Republicans — not including Sentinel Action Fund’s new investment.\n The candidates are set to face off in their final of three debates on Thursday, an event hosted by WMUR, the main local television news station for New Hampshire viewers.\n \n A field operation funded by Sentinel Action Fund has knocked more than 32,000 doors in New Hampshire this month, according to the organization. The $600,000 door-knocking operation was also designed to boost GOP congressional candidates Karoline Leavitt and Robert Burns.","dc:creator":"Natalie Allison","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/eb/28/6ff92c6c41449eb31eca9492ff18/election-2022-new-hampshire-senate-23874.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Mary Schwalm/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Don Bolduc, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, listens to a question as he campaigns at the Auburn Tavern, Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2022, in Auburn, N.H.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/eb/28/6ff92c6c41449eb31eca9492ff18/election-2022-new-hampshire-senate-23874.jpg"}}]},"content":"Don Bolduc is gaining in the polls, prompting an infusion of cash from Sentinel Action Fund.","contentSnippet":"Don Bolduc is gaining in the polls, prompting an infusion of cash from Sentinel Action Fund.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/28/bolduc-hassan-gop-pac-spending-00064044","isoDate":"2022-10-28T18:51:28.000Z"},{"title":"SE Cupp: Why Liz Cheney's endorsement of a Democrat matters","link":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/opinions/2022/10/28/liz-cheney-endorses-democrat-slotkin-se-cupp-contd-orig-mg.cnn","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 21:23:21 GMT","content":"In this week's episode of \"Unfiltered,\" SE Cupp looks at Liz Cheney's endorsement of a Democratic candidate and how Cheney has been labeled a progressive by the more extreme wings of her party.","contentSnippet":"In this week's episode of \"Unfiltered,\" SE Cupp looks at Liz Cheney's endorsement of a Democratic candidate and how Cheney has been labeled a progressive by the more extreme wings of her party.","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/opinions/2022/10/28/liz-cheney-endorses-democrat-slotkin-se-cupp-contd-orig-mg.cnn","isoDate":"2022-10-28T21:23:21.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    The Time Change: Tips For Adjusting Your Kid’s Sleep Schedule\n\n","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/parenting-sleeping-time-change_l_635bdf36e4b0cf522df8046f","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 19:17:03 -0400","content:encoded":"\n\n    Don't fear turning back the clocks an hour on Sunday, Nov. 6.

GOP nominee Mehmet Oz had just won the election, Scalise predicted.\n And Oz wouldn't even serve in the chamber Scalise may lead next year. Which made the debate-watching moment a display of earned confidence from the House minority whip, who zipped across Michigan and upstate New York over the course of two days goosing fundraising for six GOP candidates in four states as his party eyes sweeping midterm gains. \n Scalise, who’s given $3.4 million to members and candidates so far this cycle on top of $25 million to the House GOP campaign wing, predicted to a friendly crowd in Bay City, Mich., that “on November 9, you might be waking up late because you were out at the victory party really, really late.\"\n \n \n Unmentioned amid Scalise’s pre-election celebration was what awaits him and House Republicans' agenda next year if they do capture the chamber. The Louisianan, who’s set to become majority leader should his party reclaim the House, repeatedly asserted to crowds that the conference’s “Commitment to America” blueprint shows “exactly” what they’d do in the majority — yet party leaders still haven’t drilled down into the details.\n And the general promises they’ve made won’t be so simple to fulfill once they take power. For now, though, Scalise and his crew of rising Republican lawmakers were content with avoiding the messy details of legislating. \n Asked about concessions the House GOP might seek on a future debt limit vote, for instance, Scalise said simply that \"now is not the time to negotiate the debt limit,” arguing that the Biden administration hasn’t yet genuinely sought to meet and work with House GOP leadership. “There's things we want to address.\"\n He went on to describe his four-day-a-week sprint during the pre-election month as helping give \"one final jolt of energy\" to cash-hungry candidates in close races.\n “You're raising all your money prior to Labor Day to spend it all in a short period of time when people really start focusing on an election,\" Scalise said. \"And so, it's those final days, where everybody is just worn to the edges.\"\n That gave Scalise's swing a much different vibe than the large rallies and open events that are common in the earlier months of a campaign. To convince GOP donors to open up their frayed pocketbooks one last time, Scalise was ushered before small groups of supporters and candidates who saw his presence in their district as a sign of burgeoning GOP influence.\n \n  \n On Tuesday, Scalise joined Michigan GOP candidate Paul Junge and roughly 40 supporters who flocked to a windowless meeting room in a local manufacturing plant to hear Scalise and Junge talk about serving as a check on the Biden administration. Junge, a former Trump administration official, is working to oust Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, whose family has represented the area for more than 40 years — though the seat became competitive after redistricting.\n Then Scalise pushed on to stump in the Detroit suburbs for Tom Barrett, a Michigan state senator who's looking to unseat Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the state’s newly drawn 7th Congressional District. Slotkin is one of 31 Democrats who helped power her party to the majority in 2018 but now face existential threats during a midterm that's swinging away from them.\n Barrett and Slotkin are on pace to have one of the most expensive House races of the midterms, with millions of dollars dropped on the airwaves each month. Underscoring the intensity of the campaign, Scalise's crew was joined at the Barrett event by Michigan GOP candidate John James, Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) and former Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.).\n Scalise and his colleagues tuned into the Fetterman-Oz debate on their way from Michigan to Utica, where they appeared at a bar event for New York GOP candidate Brandon Williams before pushing on to Binghamton, where they stopped by a country club event for Republican hopeful Marc Molinaro.\n Both Williams and Molinaro are vying against Democratic challengers for swing seats; Williams is running against Francis Conole for retiring Rep. John Katko’s (R-N.Y.) seat, and Molinaro is squaring off against Josh Riley to represent a newly drawn district that includes part of the Hudson Valley.\n \n In separate interviews, Junge, Barrett and Molinaro all touted their ability to draw the likely future House majority leader as a sign their races are in play. One Michigan GOP official even excitedly accepted an autographed Commitment to America one-pager from Scalise.\n “It shows folks here in the district that this district really is in play,” Junge said in an interview after his event with Scalise. “I think they're excited about seeing Republicans from all over the country come to support what I'm doing.”\n Barrett noted that Scalise’s visit is a “great signal to the donors that are here that this is the utmost important race to focus on.”\n He's hardly the only GOP leader to lend their cred to candidates. Minority Leader and speaker frontrunner Kevin McCarthy, as well as National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer, are among the senior Republicans also crisscrossing the country in the final days before the midterms.\n Scalise was joined by his chief deputy whip, Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) and Ohio GOP candidate Max Miller. And of course, like his fellow top Republicans elsewhere on the map, Scalise used his stump speech to blast Democrats.\n But his other rhetorical flourishes offered clues to how he would help shape messaging for a future majority: Scalise cited former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's departure from the Democratic Party to argue that his rivals are too far-left; he praised Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin as a “glimmer of hope” for flipping the state red last year; and Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks' (R-Iowa) 2020 victory by just 6 votes powered a reminder that every vote counts.\n \n Befitting the friendliness of the crowds, Scalise and his colleagues fielded questions that ranged from how they would stop the Biden administration’s spending and executive orders to the tight Senate races in Georgia and Pennsylvania to the need to investigate President Joe Biden’s eldest son, Hunter Biden.\n And the avoidance of challenging topics — like how they'll handle the need to raise the debt limit, or whether they'll try to make Trump-era tax cuts permanent — didn't break the Republicans' stride on a trip that felt as much about chemistry-building as it did about fundraising. Scalise's traveling partners predicted that their camaraderie on the road would help their work on the Hill go more smoothly.\n “It does the same thing in the military or any team sport,” said Miller.","dc:creator":"Olivia Beavers","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/b3/b7/6baf787a4e0ba3f3648c65d54517/image-2-edit.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Olivia Beavers/POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"House Minority Whip Steve Scalise joins GOP candidate Paul Junge and his supporters during a campaign event in Bay City, Mich., on Oct. 25, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/b3/b7/6baf787a4e0ba3f3648c65d54517/image-2-edit.jpg"}}]},"content":"Steve Scalise, the Louisianan who would become majority leader in a Republican House, brought a crew with him to boost the party faithful before Election Day.","contentSnippet":"Steve Scalise, the Louisianan who would become majority leader in a Republican House, brought a crew with him to boost the party faithful before Election Day.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/on-road-with-house-gop-victory-party-00063795","isoDate":"2022-10-27T19:11:15.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    My Baby Died In My Arms.

You don’t have to endorse any of the specific proposals talked about by these very different people to be disturbed by the campus-like fervor with which they have been deemed unsayable and unthinkable.</p> <p>Although it’s possible that the Russia war machine, if it can be called that, simply collapses in Ukraine, it is more likely that war will end in some messy compromise involving a negotiated settlement.

Indeed, it’s their go-to proposal for solving any international problem, no matter how intractable or threatening. That it has now become a toxic notion in the context of the Ukraine war is a sign of how a justified feeling of moral righteousness among backers of Ukraine is swallowing rational thought about how the war might end.\n The letter to President Joe Biden from 30 House progressives led by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, engendered the same intensely negative reaction as public musings about diplomatic deals by Elon Musk and Henry Kissinger. You don’t have to endorse any of the specific proposals talked about by these very different people to be disturbed by the campus-like fervor with which they have been deemed unsayable and unthinkable.\n Although it’s possible that the Russia war machine, if it can be called that, simply collapses in Ukraine, it is more likely that war will end in some messy compromise involving a negotiated settlement. Acknowledging this — and that the continuation of the conflict is a humanitarian catastrophe with enormous costs for the West and the world — shouldn’t be a quasi-thought crime.\n The Jayapal letter’s call for “direct talks with Russia” as Ukraine makes battlefield gains and Russia has responded with attacks on civilian infrastructure was obviously inopportune, and this wouldn’t be the first move regardless — we’d want to get Volodymyr Zelenskyy on board with any diplomatic proposal as a first order of business.\n Yet the letter was hardly an apology for Vladimir Putin.

Abortion, she noted, “has always been my choice, and I want it to continue to be their choice.”</p> <p>Garcia-Rodriguez lived in McAllen and had recently returned to school to finish her Bachelor’s degree in biomedical sciences. She had been following the campaign of Vallejo, the congressional candidate, but wasn’t yet familiar with Garza.

So my parents were very, very religious people — but they were also very pro-choice.” Her mother was a public school teacher and her dad, whose family has “been here for five generations,” she said, grew up farming and went on to become a judge in district state court. Her brother, Robby, experienced a brain injury during childbirth that resulted in disabilities; he passed away before she went to college. Seeing her parents fight for her brother was what set her on her path to advocacy, she said.

In Texas, AGs can’t initiate local criminal prosecutions unless the district attorneys request their assistance, explained Jennifer Laurin, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law. In other words, power over criminal prosecutions in the state largely rests with district attorneys. But in jurisdictions that are resource-strapped and have the inclination to prosecute, “it becomes much more attractive to pursue these kinds of cases” with the AG’s help, says Laurin. An AG vowing not to lend resources is “not for nothing,” she added.</p> <p>Garza also pointed out that Republican state lawmakers have threatened to pass more extreme legislation, such as <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/23/texas-companies-pay-abortions/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;going after businesses&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/23/texas-companies-pay-abortions/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">going after businesses</a> that assist people seeking an abortion out-of-state. “Those are not constitutional in my mind,” she said. “We do have freedom of travel.” She noted she could issue opinions and say a restriction is unconstitutional.

I thought of her comment when, driving from Austin to Arlington recently, I-35 was stippled with anti-abortion billboards, which seemed as part of the Texas landscape as the signs counting down to Buc-ee’s, a gas station chain with a culty beaver mascot. But anecdotally, Hays described a state that was shifting. “I grew up near Abilene and San Angelo. Abilene is very much the buckle of the Bible belt, there are three Christian colleges,” she told me. When she <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/back-abilene-orourke-keeps-pg-203132927.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;was there with O’Rourke&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/now/back-abilene-orourke-keeps-pg-203132927.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">was there with O’Rourke</a> recently, people in Abilene were talking about abortion rights and gun control, she said. “What parallel universe did I just enter that people in Abilene are saying these things out loud?” she recalled thinking. “They didn’t say them out loud when I was growing up.”</p> <p>Garza’s challenge now is convincing some moderate and conservative Texans that protecting abortion is not only a concern, but worth crossing party lines for in November. In Texas, “it’s not quite enough [for Democratic statewide candidates] to simply mobilize the Democratic base because they’re at a disadvantage,” explained James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project. To win, those candidates also have to find voters among independents or disaffected Republicans. Abortion is an issue that gives Democrats “some potential to increase that number somewhat,” he said. When I caught up with him again in October, he observed that “you have to be able to get people to act upon that attitude and to prioritize that issue, and we're just not seeing signs that that's happening in large numbers.”</p> <p>In their poll, 78 percent of Texas Democrats indicated that abortion was “very important” to their vote, compared to 40 percent of Republicans.

Henson earlier pointed out that “there are a lot of other factors at play, and it’s one thing to look at an instance such as the Kansas referendum, in which the electorate was focused solely on abortion, and a general election in Texas where you’ve got two very polarized parties” and “it’s very hard to get partisans to vote for the opposing party,” he said.</p> <p>Paxton has leveraged that environment by closely aligning himself with Trump, including appealing to his supporters through a salvo of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/paxton-bush-primary-runoff.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;culture war-related&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/paxton-bush-primary-runoff.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b7179000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b7179000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">culture war-related</a> legal actions and <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-sues-battleground-states-unconstitutional-changes-2020-election-laws\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;challenging the results&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-sues-battleground-states-unconstitutional-changes-2020-election-laws&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b7179000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b7179000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">challenging the results</a> of the 2020 election. “His approval ratings are strongest among people who identify as extremely conservative,” Henson noted. Paxton’s latest attack ad against Garza paints her as a “liberal extremist” who is anti-border patrol and “wants completely open borders.” (“We can fight human, gun and drug trafficking at the border and across the state, while having humane immigration policies,” she wrote me.)</p> <p>Paxton does not mention abortion in his recent ads against Garza, though he’s trumpeted his anti-abortion litigation in the past. (Paxton did not respond to a request for comment.) His anti-abortion actions have not gone unnoticed by those who support him. Joe Pojman, the executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, told me that Garza would be a “disaster on the life issue, and I don’t think she is committed to defending the laws of the state of Texas.” He also noted that, especially after Kansas, “we cannot allow our voters to be complacent. We can take nothing for granted.”</p> <p>When Garza campaigns across Texas — she has visited cities such as Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston, border towns like Del Rio and Alamo, and more conservative areas including Waxahachie and Hunt County, according to a campaign list — she talks openly about abortion. She frames it as a matter of gender equity but also focuses on pregnant people whose health is at risk, a point that could appeal to conservative-leaning women who might oppose abortion in other cases. Paxton’s policies, she tells voters, not only limit reproductive freedom — they could kill you. (Garza was leading Paxton among likely women voters by five points, according to a <a href=\"https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/1b04325cefce0be5ceaca2817da3bdfa/TexasElection2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;University of Houston/Texas Southern University poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/1b04325cefce0be5ceaca2817da3bdfa/TexasElection2022.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">University of Houston/Texas Southern University poll</a>, though the Texas Politics Project poll found Paxton ahead by four.)</p> <p>It’s a message that Garza also sees resonating with Latino voters in Texas, including in the Valley where she grew up, an area that has historically leaned heavily Democrat but sees low voter turnout. In the 2022 primary, which generally saw low participation, Democratic turnout in the lower RGV was about 9 percent compared to 4 percent for Republicans, according to the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Texas Tribune&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/texas-primary-voting-turnout/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71790013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Texas Tribune</a>.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/cb/4b/ec7811614a868129bee3724a77c0/mag.Leibelson.RochelleGarza-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>When speaking to voters in McAllen, she connected the role of the attorney general to a story about her grandmother, who had 13 children and “loved every single one of those kids,” but told her to keep studying and not have a boyfriend — so she could chart her own course in life. She braided the personal and political in a way that recognized marginalized communities that have had to fight for reproductive freedom.</p> <p>“I love the Valley. We are so culturally rich, and we have so much love,” Garza said when she took the informal stage in front of the Texas flag. By then, several dozen people had gathered. “Yet we have policies that are on the national [and state] scale impacting us, that are tearing our communities apart, that are preventing people from having access to healthcare,” she said.

Even her last name “carries a lot of weight with those who have been most impacted by some of the harmful laws that have passed in Texas.” Earlier in our conversation, she told me that she felt the electorate had already changed as a result of the <i>Dobbs</i> decision and pointed to new voters who’ve registered because of it.

She reflected later that there’s not a specific way she approaches these conversations whether someone is anti-choice or not. “I listen intently,” she wrote me. “Because while these are experiences people have every day — the stigma around abortion care hinders us from feeling like we can talk about it.”<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"McAllen, Texas — On a Friday evening in McAllen, Texas, a small, palm-lined city in the Rio Grande Valley, I was waiting in a former bank outside the sort of miniature, intimate room that many people who pump milk would recognize. Rochelle Garza, 37, invited me inside, greeting me in a patterned nursing apron while holding a milk bottle for her infant daughter. “I appreciate you letting me multitask,” she said, laughing. I sat across from her and her campaign manager, feeling like what had been a makeshift lactation room was now a tiny, secret bunker.\n Garza, a former ACLU attorney and a Democrat who grew up in the Valley, is running for Texas attorney general against Republican incumbent Ken Paxton, a powerful political figure known for his intense allyship with Donald Trump. No Democrat has won the state attorney general race since 1994. But the mood that August night was sunny. Her campaign had been recently buoyed by a Dallas Morning News-UT-Tyler poll\",\"_id\":\"00000184-06a7-d4d4-a7af-ceffab880000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Dallas Morning News-UT-Tyler poll showing her within two points of Paxton, while fellow Democrat Beto O’Rourke trailed in his gubernatorial race by seven. All at once, a relatively unknown candidate from south Texas looked like she had a shot at winning. Texas Democrats questioned the lack of media attention on her. Republicans seemed unworried. (“Rochelle who?” the Texas GOP chair said at the time.)\n In the room where Garza was set to appear with congressional candidate Michelle Vallejo for a meet-and-greet hosted by the Rio Grande Valley College Democrats, students bounded around like they were throwing a party and hoping people would show up. Pink-and-yellow streamers hung from the ceiling; a balloon popped. The stereo playing Taylor Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble” fuzzed in and out. Someone produced a piñata of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s bust.\n The vibe, decidedly DIY, was far away from the fundraiser that Paxton, 59, was slated to hold some two weeks later at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. (Big donors could reportedly earn a private jet ride from Dallas.) But despite his national profile, among the top statewide incumbents in Texas, Paxton has generally been viewed as the most beatable: Polls released in September placed Garza between three and eight points of Paxton — equal or closer than O’Rourke’s margins with Abbott. The most recent poll of “likely voters” by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, Austin, a pool that skews more conservative, found her trailing by 14 and O’Rourke by 11.\n Paxton was never a perfect candidate: He’s been riding out criminal indictment on securities-fraud charges for seven years, and his legal morass risks turning off at least some moderate conservatives. But whether he endures this time could hinge in particular on how voters respond — or don’t — to the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling, which allowed Texas to ban abortion except in certain emergency scenarios. Paxton has used the AG’s office to oppose abortion in even the most extreme circumstances, while Garza, who as a lawyer represented teens seeking abortion care, wants abortion to be legal and has unabashedly centered the issue in her campaign since the primary. (She prevailed in her primary runoff against Joe Jaworski, the former mayor of Galveston who presented himself as more moderate, by about 25 points. Paxton won his by roughly 35.) Both campaigns recently boosted their fundraising, with Garza hauling in over $1.62 million since July 1, just after the Dobbs decision, compared to Paxton’s roughly $2.1 million. (He still has far more reported cash on hand — over $4.8 million compared to her $1.5 million or so.)\n \nNow, weeks from Election Day, Garza is traveling the state, hoping to boost enthusiasm and turnout among the Democratic base, especially women and Latino voters, and convince them why the AG’s race matters. (She also still has to introduce herself: The Texas Politics Project poll from October found that 59 percent of likely voters didn’t express a favorable or unfavorable opinion about her.) And as other Democratic politicians in Texas have learned, it’s not enough to energize the Democratic electorate. To win, Garza will have to mobilize voters who aren’t Democrats, too.\n Garza is still betting she can, not only because of Paxton’s legal issues, but because of Dobbs. “Kansas showed us that abortion is not controversial,” she said when we spoke in McAllen. She was relaxed, but when she described the realities in Texas, her voice turned resolute. She cited polling finding that the vast majority of Texans support abortion access in some form. But “the folks in power right now have completely outlawed it,” she said. “There’s no exception for incest or rape. There’s still confusion over what does it mean to to provide an abortion to save the life of a mother.”\n “We’re in an absolute crisis in Texas,” she added.\n \n  \n Outside, a few people were lined up in the early evening heat waiting to check in.\n “My mom wasn’t very political or anything,” said Natasha Garcia-Rodriguez, a 33-year-old attendee in floral sneakers, who stood inside with her 17-year-old daughter. “But I want to teach them how to be, and how to stand up for themselves and vote in ways that protect their rights,” she said, speaking of her daughter’s generation. Abortion, she noted, “has always been my choice, and I want it to continue to be their choice.”\n Garcia-Rodriguez lived in McAllen and had recently returned to school to finish her Bachelor’s degree in biomedical sciences. She had been following the campaign of Vallejo, the congressional candidate, but wasn’t yet familiar with Garza. She also told me she hadn’t attended a campaign event before, though she’d voted for Democrats in previous elections.\n Had the fall of Roe made her want to get more involved?\n “Yeah,” she said, in a uh-yeah sort of way. “Definitely.”\n \n Garza’s hometown, Brownsville, is about an hour east of McAllen and hugs the U.S.-Mexico border. “I grew up in a very Catholic household,” she told me. “I was crowd-surfed to Pope John Paul II at eight months old, and blessed by the Pope. So my parents were very, very religious people — but they were also very pro-choice.” Her mother was a public school teacher and her dad, whose family has “been here for five generations,” she said, grew up farming and went on to become a judge in district state court. Her brother, Robby, experienced a brain injury during childbirth that resulted in disabilities; he passed away before she went to college. Seeing her parents fight for her brother was what set her on her path to advocacy, she said. After college (Brown) and law school (Houston Law Center), she returned home, and prior to private practice, she assisted unaccompanied minors in the U.S. escaping violence in their home countries.\n As a private attorney, she was the appointed guardian for “Jane Doe,” a teenager held in immigration custody in Brownsville who sought an abortion, while the Trump administration tried to block it. As attorney general, Paxton sided with the federal government in the Jane Doe case. But Garza prevailed: The case resulted in the eponymous “Garza Notice” that spells out abortion rights for youth in immigration custody.\n Garza told me that she sees the AG role as the “queen on the chessboard” in that “the powers of this office are vast, and the duty of the office doesn’t run to anyone else other than the people of Texas.” When it comes to abortion, the office-holder has sway in choosing what to litigate and affecting how the law is interpreted and enforced. Paxton has promised to do “everything in [his] power” to protect “unborn children.” He successfully revived a 1925-era abortion ban over a month before the state’s trigger law went into effect. And he sued the Biden administration over guidance effectively saying that Texas hospitals must provide abortions in medical emergencies beyond what the state law permits. Paxton claimed state law already protects pregnant women, but others fear doctors have to postpone care, even in cases where a pregnancy is nonviable, until patients' lives are at risk. (“If he wins that case, women will die. Not just in Texas, but all over the country,” Garza told me at the time. A federal judge in Texas subsequently ruled for Paxton in a more narrow decision.)\n Garza, if she wins, has pledged to use her office to protect reproductive rights. She said she would withdraw from Paxton’s lawsuit against the Biden administration. And she would not prosecute “people who have abortions, nor anyone who helps a loved one have an abortion, including doctors,” she wrote in an email in response to my question seeking clarification about whether she would pursue the minimum-$100K civil penalties against physicians that provide abortions under the state’s trigger law.\n It remains to be seen how her pledge not to prosecute might play out in the state, but Garza hopes it will help provide some security to doctors who fear civil or criminal repercussions for making the best health care choices for their patients. In Texas, AGs can’t initiate local criminal prosecutions unless the district attorneys request their assistance, explained Jennifer Laurin, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law. In other words, power over criminal prosecutions in the state largely rests with district attorneys. But in jurisdictions that are resource-strapped and have the inclination to prosecute, “it becomes much more attractive to pursue these kinds of cases” with the AG’s help, says Laurin. An AG vowing not to lend resources is “not for nothing,” she added.\n Garza also pointed out that Republican state lawmakers have threatened to pass more extreme legislation, such as going after businesses that assist people seeking an abortion out-of-state. “Those are not constitutional in my mind,” she said. “We do have freedom of travel.” She noted she could issue opinions and say a restriction is unconstitutional. In Texas, AG opinions influence how a law is interpreted, though courts have the ultimate say. She also noted she believes “organizations that help pregnant Texans access health care should not be penalized” when I asked her about abortion funds that assist Texans traveling out-of state. A group of funds are not currently operating in Texas, saying they fear penalties from Paxton and others.\n \n  \n Susan Hays, an attorney who worked with Garza on the Jane Doe case and is running for Texas agricultural commissioner, told me that, five years ago, she never thought someone like herself, tagged as “an abortion lawyer,” could win statewide. I thought of her comment when, driving from Austin to Arlington recently, I-35 was stippled with anti-abortion billboards, which seemed as part of the Texas landscape as the signs counting down to Buc-ee’s, a gas station chain with a culty beaver mascot. But anecdotally, Hays described a state that was shifting. “I grew up near Abilene and San Angelo. Abilene is very much the buckle of the Bible belt, there are three Christian colleges,” she told me. When she was there with O’Rourke recently, people in Abilene were talking about abortion rights and gun control, she said. “What parallel universe did I just enter that people in Abilene are saying these things out loud?” she recalled thinking. “They didn’t say them out loud when I was growing up.”\n Garza’s challenge now is convincing some moderate and conservative Texans that protecting abortion is not only a concern, but worth crossing party lines for in November. In Texas, “it’s not quite enough [for Democratic statewide candidates] to simply mobilize the Democratic base because they’re at a disadvantage,” explained James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project. To win, those candidates also have to find voters among independents or disaffected Republicans. Abortion is an issue that gives Democrats “some potential to increase that number somewhat,” he said. When I caught up with him again in October, he observed that “you have to be able to get people to act upon that attitude and to prioritize that issue, and we're just not seeing signs that that's happening in large numbers.”\n In their poll, 78 percent of Texas Democrats indicated that abortion was “very important” to their vote, compared to 40 percent of Republicans. Only 13 percent of voters overall, however, listed abortion as “most important,” with other issues vying for attention, including immigration and border security, which took over double that share. Henson earlier pointed out that “there are a lot of other factors at play, and it’s one thing to look at an instance such as the Kansas referendum, in which the electorate was focused solely on abortion, and a general election in Texas where you’ve got two very polarized parties” and “it’s very hard to get partisans to vote for the opposing party,” he said.\n Paxton has leveraged that environment by closely aligning himself with Trump, including appealing to his supporters through a salvo of culture war-related legal actions and challenging the results of the 2020 election. “His approval ratings are strongest among people who identify as extremely conservative,” Henson noted. Paxton’s latest attack ad against Garza paints her as a “liberal extremist” who is anti-border patrol and “wants completely open borders.” (“We can fight human, gun and drug trafficking at the border and across the state, while having humane immigration policies,” she wrote me.)\n Paxton does not mention abortion in his recent ads against Garza, though he’s trumpeted his anti-abortion litigation in the past. (Paxton did not respond to a request for comment.) His anti-abortion actions have not gone unnoticed by those who support him. Joe Pojman, the executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, told me that Garza would be a “disaster on the life issue, and I don’t think she is committed to defending the laws of the state of Texas.” He also noted that, especially after Kansas, “we cannot allow our voters to be complacent. We can take nothing for granted.”\n When Garza campaigns across Texas — she has visited cities such as Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston, border towns like Del Rio and Alamo, and more conservative areas including Waxahachie and Hunt County, according to a campaign list — she talks openly about abortion. She frames it as a matter of gender equity but also focuses on pregnant people whose health is at risk, a point that could appeal to conservative-leaning women who might oppose abortion in other cases. Paxton’s policies, she tells voters, not only limit reproductive freedom — they could kill you. (Garza was leading Paxton among likely women voters by five points, according to a University of Houston/Texas Southern University poll, though the Texas Politics Project poll found Paxton ahead by four.)\n It’s a message that Garza also sees resonating with Latino voters in Texas, including in the Valley where she grew up, an area that has historically leaned heavily Democrat but sees low voter turnout. In the 2022 primary, which generally saw low participation, Democratic turnout in the lower RGV was about 9 percent compared to 4 percent for Republicans, according to the Texas Tribune.\n \n  \n When speaking to voters in McAllen, she connected the role of the attorney general to a story about her grandmother, who had 13 children and “loved every single one of those kids,” but told her to keep studying and not have a boyfriend — so she could chart her own course in life. She braided the personal and political in a way that recognized marginalized communities that have had to fight for reproductive freedom.\n “I love the Valley. We are so culturally rich, and we have so much love,” Garza said when she took the informal stage in front of the Texas flag. By then, several dozen people had gathered. “Yet we have policies that are on the national [and state] scale impacting us, that are tearing our communities apart, that are preventing people from having access to healthcare,” she said. In south Texas, Democrats have in some ways moved away from focusing on abortion, perhaps due to the region’s religious bent. (“I think there is this myth that Latinos aren’t supportive of abortion access,” Garza told me. “That’s just not true.”) But the Valley has also seen local activists rally in favor of abortion rights. Garza referenced that record, pointing to the nearby town of Edinburg, which last year saw protesters effectively shutdown a proposed anti-abortion ordinance. “That is the power that you all have,” she told the crowd.\n Republicans have been aggressively trying to mobilize Latino voters in south Texas, too, expanding on support for Trump and focusing on issues like border security. They’ve claimed the House seat flip by Republican Mayra Flores as a success. But Garza pushed back against the narrative that Republicans are making major gains among Latino voters in the region. “Voters in south Texas are not necessarily turning out in big numbers,” Garza countered to me. “They’re not being given a reason to turn out to vote. And that starts with representation.”\n Being from the Valley, like Garza is, “brings out different voters,” said Michelle Ortiz, executive director of the Democratic Attorneys General Association. Even her last name “carries a lot of weight with those who have been most impacted by some of the harmful laws that have passed in Texas.” Earlier in our conversation, she told me that she felt the electorate had already changed as a result of the Dobbs decision and pointed to new voters who’ve registered because of it.

Forget Johnson's musings on Covid-19 vaccines, widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and Hunter Biden, Democrats are bringing former President Barack Obama to this lakeside city on Saturday and spending millions on the airwaves to fight for a Barnes victory in a hostile national environment.\n And with Barnes raising more than $20 million in the third quarter to Johnson's $12.3 million, the Democratic campaign says it will spend nearly twice as much on television and broadcast in October than it did in September. Still, party officials fear its best efforts won’t be enough to topple its top-targeted Senate incumbent, imperiling its ability to hold on to the majority.\n Whether the Democratic dollars will be enough to deliver a Barnes victory is uncertain, after his summer polling lead evaporated after Republicans pummeled him over the airwaves in September.

But Trump and Biden, both of whom have huge egos, want to feed that ego.”</p> <p>As one of the country’s most pivotal swing states, Pennsylvania grabs outsized interest from any potential presidential aspirant. Biden and Trump, who beat Hillary Clinton there in 2016, are no different.</p> <p>Each of the men began the fall campaign season with Labor Day stops in Pennsylvania. Trump helped boost the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Doug Mastriano, a state legislator who attended the Jan. 6 rally and won the former president’s endorsement by amplifying lies around the 2020 election results in the state. Trump raised the stakes for himself further there in the Senate race by endorsing celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz, who eked out a primary win and is now locked in a close race with Democrat John Fetterman, himself one of the few Senate candidates from a battleground state who is comfortable standing alongside Biden at political events.</p> <p>Biden advisers, close allies and others working in the state continue to believe that his presence there down the stretch will translate into a net positive for Democrats, despite a consistent drip of public and private opinion polls showing his approval ratings hovering around the mid-40s. They point to his roots in Scranton and what they view as an extraordinary sense for the state’s mores and political climate.</p> <p>“Pennsylvania is personal for him. He really considers it home. He knows it better than anywhere. And he relates to those voters,” said Celinda Lake, a pollster for Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314388766112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>Trump aides downplay the idea that he has more intense interest in Pennsylvania than other states, noting that he’s also hosting upcoming rallies in Iowa, Ohio, and Florida, and that his super PAC is placing seven-figure ad buys for the Senate in places like Georgia and Arizona. But they also view the late campaign stop as a chance to cement his image as the party’s preeminent kingmaker.</p> <p>“Trump coming to town serves no benefit to Mastriano and it might help Oz continue to solidify his base. Republicans still aren’t all home yet because they question if he is truly a conservative or is just paying lip service to it,” said one longtime Republican operative in the state who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the race.</p> <p>As a matter of sheer footprint, Biden has invested more in Pennsylvania than Trump. His two more upcoming swings through Pennsylvania — which may not be his last this cycle — will be his 21st and 22nd visits to the state, according to a tally of travel by Mark Knoller, the unofficial longtime record keeper of the White House press corps. Biden has visited the other battlegrounds of Wisconsin just four times, North Carolina three, Georgia three and Nevada just once.</p> <p>On Friday night, Biden and Harris will give speeches at the Pennsylvania Democratic Party’s annual Independence Dinner, which will be attended by the candidates at the top of the state’s ticket. The event is expected to raise $1 million for the state party, party officials said.</p> <p>Through his control of the Democratic National Committee, Biden has also helped quadruple the investment in Pennsylvania compared to the 2018 election cycle, though there was not a hotly contested Senate race that year. Democrats are sending far more money to the state party as well, which helps fund core infrastructure, operations and data.</p> <p>Those investments could go a long way to helping the party squeak out a win for Fetterman. For months now, Biden has regularly sought updates from aides and associates about the Senate race, according to three people who have spoken with the president in recent weeks. The most common answer he’s gotten is ones he easily could have intuited on his own: It’s very close and is expected to stay that way until the end.</p> <p>White House officials and outside Biden advisers have closely monitored Fetterman’s recovery process from a stroke five months ago. Some have privately shared concerns even as the White House publicly insisted that the lieutenant governor was just as capable of mounting a winning campaign as he’d always been.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314526032112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>But those concerns intensified this week after a lackluster debate performance by Fetterman highlighted his speech challenges following the stroke. And others have thrown up their hands in frustration as Fetterman’s lead over Oz diminished under an avalanche of attacks over urban crime.</p> <p>“I don’t understand why we’re not fighting back more effectively on crime,” said Ed Rendell, the former Democratic governor of the state, who recently joined Biden at the fundraiser for Fetterman’s campaign. Rendell said attempts to push back haven’t been forceful enough — and he stressed that his critique of the crime issue extended to the White House, on down. “We’ve ceded that to [Republicans] too easily. We’re afraid to talk about it.”</p> <p>The White House takes some solace in the governor’s race, where state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the Democrat, seems poised for a relatively easy win. Indeed, Mastriano is viewed as such a potential drag on Oz that Fetterman’s campaign has increasingly tried to link the two Republicans together. In a rapid-response ad the Democrat released following the debate, he mentioned Mastriano in a clip of Oz saying he wanted “local political leaders” involved in abortion decisions.</p> <p>“When you say you want to put ‘local political leaders’ in charge, [elected officials like] Mastriano are the local leaders he’s supporting,” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democrat who competed in the U.S. Senate primary and now supports Fetterman. He added that Oz and Mastriano are “connected and they have always been. This is a package deal.”</p> <p>But Democrats aren’t pinning their entire strategy on Mastriano being an anchor around Oz’s neck. And the party is hopeful that the Biden-Obama tandem will motivate base voters.</p> <p>“Right now, it’s a lot of noise, a lot of nonsense, but he has a record of success he’s been able to push through with the slimmest majorities,” Kenyatta said of Biden. “People are frustrated with Washington, but that doesn’t mean they are disappointed with the president, per se.”</p> <p>Trump’s bet in Pennsylvania is that Biden will be the drag on the ticket that Democrats believe Mastriano is for Republicans. In announcing his stop in the state, the former president derided his successor’s approval ratings. The day after the Oz-Fetterman Senate debate, the Trump-backed Make America Great Again, Inc. super PAC dropped over $800,000 on an ad that linked Biden to Fetterman and called them both “clueless” and “weak.”<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314405853112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>Overall, the group has spent $2.6 million in the state.</p> <p>Trump’s eyes have not just been on 2022, however. Pennsylvania was one of a handful of states whose election results he unsuccessfully tried to overturn. And more recently, Trump allies have plotted to target mail-in voting laws in the state that they say, without evidence, contributed to his loss in 2020. In September, Trump met with a group of Republicans at his office in Trump Tower who asked him to push state legislators to repeal Act 77, which allows for no-excuse mail voting in Pennsylvania.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/10/17/2022/donald-trumps-plan-to-kill-mail-ballots-in-pennsylvania\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;News of that meeting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/10/17/2022/donald-trumps-plan-to-kill-mail-ballots-in-pennsylvania&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b712f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b712f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">News of that meeting</a> has led to concerns Trump is trying to reshape state laws on voting ahead of the midterms — and also any potential presidential run.

Trump raised the stakes for himself further there in the Senate race by endorsing celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz, who eked out a primary win and is now locked in a close race with Democrat John Fetterman, himself one of the few Senate candidates from a battleground state who is comfortable standing alongside Biden at political events.\n Biden advisers, close allies and others working in the state continue to believe that his presence there down the stretch will translate into a net positive for Democrats, despite a consistent drip of public and private opinion polls showing his approval ratings hovering around the mid-40s. They point to his roots in Scranton and what they view as an extraordinary sense for the state’s mores and political climate.\n “Pennsylvania is personal for him. He really considers it home. He knows it better than anywhere. And he relates to those voters,” said Celinda Lake, a pollster for Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.\n \n \n Trump aides downplay the idea that he has more intense interest in Pennsylvania than other states, noting that he’s also hosting upcoming rallies in Iowa, Ohio, and Florida, and that his super PAC is placing seven-figure ad buys for the Senate in places like Georgia and Arizona. But they also view the late campaign stop as a chance to cement his image as the party’s preeminent kingmaker.\n “Trump coming to town serves no benefit to Mastriano and it might help Oz continue to solidify his base. Republicans still aren’t all home yet because they question if he is truly a conservative or is just paying lip service to it,” said one longtime Republican operative in the state who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the race.\n As a matter of sheer footprint, Biden has invested more in Pennsylvania than Trump. His two more upcoming swings through Pennsylvania — which may not be his last this cycle — will be his 21st and 22nd visits to the state, according to a tally of travel by Mark Knoller, the unofficial longtime record keeper of the White House press corps. Biden has visited the other battlegrounds of Wisconsin just four times, North Carolina three, Georgia three and Nevada just once.\n On Friday night, Biden and Harris will give speeches at the Pennsylvania Democratic Party’s annual Independence Dinner, which will be attended by the candidates at the top of the state’s ticket. The event is expected to raise $1 million for the state party, party officials said.\n Through his control of the Democratic National Committee, Biden has also helped quadruple the investment in Pennsylvania compared to the 2018 election cycle, though there was not a hotly contested Senate race that year. Democrats are sending far more money to the state party as well, which helps fund core infrastructure, operations and data.\n Those investments could go a long way to helping the party squeak out a win for Fetterman. For months now, Biden has regularly sought updates from aides and associates about the Senate race, according to three people who have spoken with the president in recent weeks. The most common answer he’s gotten is ones he easily could have intuited on his own: It’s very close and is expected to stay that way until the end.\n White House officials and outside Biden advisers have closely monitored Fetterman’s recovery process from a stroke five months ago. Some have privately shared concerns even as the White House publicly insisted that the lieutenant governor was just as capable of mounting a winning campaign as he’d always been.\n \n \n But those concerns intensified this week after a lackluster debate performance by Fetterman highlighted his speech challenges following the stroke. And others have thrown up their hands in frustration as Fetterman’s lead over Oz diminished under an avalanche of attacks over urban crime.\n “I don’t understand why we’re not fighting back more effectively on crime,” said Ed Rendell, the former Democratic governor of the state, who recently joined Biden at the fundraiser for Fetterman’s campaign. Rendell said attempts to push back haven’t been forceful enough — and he stressed that his critique of the crime issue extended to the White House, on down. “We’ve ceded that to [Republicans] too easily. We’re afraid to talk about it.”\n The White House takes some solace in the governor’s race, where state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the Democrat, seems poised for a relatively easy win. Indeed, Mastriano is viewed as such a potential drag on Oz that Fetterman’s campaign has increasingly tried to link the two Republicans together. In a rapid-response ad the Democrat released following the debate, he mentioned Mastriano in a clip of Oz saying he wanted “local political leaders” involved in abortion decisions.\n “When you say you want to put ‘local political leaders’ in charge, [elected officials like] Mastriano are the local leaders he’s supporting,” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democrat who competed in the U.S. Senate primary and now supports Fetterman. He added that Oz and Mastriano are “connected and they have always been. This is a package deal.”\n But Democrats aren’t pinning their entire strategy on Mastriano being an anchor around Oz’s neck. And the party is hopeful that the Biden-Obama tandem will motivate base voters.\n “Right now, it’s a lot of noise, a lot of nonsense, but he has a record of success he’s been able to push through with the slimmest majorities,” Kenyatta said of Biden. “People are frustrated with Washington, but that doesn’t mean they are disappointed with the president, per se.”\n Trump’s bet in Pennsylvania is that Biden will be the drag on the ticket that Democrats believe Mastriano is for Republicans. In announcing his stop in the state, the former president derided his successor’s approval ratings. The day after the Oz-Fetterman Senate debate, the Trump-backed Make America Great Again, Inc. super PAC dropped over $800,000 on an ad that linked Biden to Fetterman and called them both “clueless” and “weak.”\n \n \n Overall, the group has spent $2.6 million in the state.\n Trump’s eyes have not just been on 2022, however. Pennsylvania was one of a handful of states whose election results he unsuccessfully tried to overturn. And more recently, Trump allies have plotted to target mail-in voting laws in the state that they say, without evidence, contributed to his loss in 2020. In September, Trump met with a group of Republicans at his office in Trump Tower who asked him to push state legislators to repeal Act 77, which allows for no-excuse mail voting in Pennsylvania.\n News of that meeting has led to concerns Trump is trying to reshape state laws on voting ahead of the midterms — and also any potential presidential run. But a person close to the effort to repeal Act 77 from the election code said there are currently no plans to get a motion on the ballot before the end of the current legislative session.\n Trump’s trip to the state is, in part, to try and change that dynamic, in addition to boosting Oz among a still somewhat skeptical GOP base before election day. But, like Biden, he will be measuring his own standing in Pennsylvania too. The question for some veterans of the state’s political scene, is whether they will do more harm or good.\n \n “It’s election season, and if you can get a former president or a president to come in you do it,” said Ryan Costello, a former Republican representative and Trump critic from outside Philadelphia. “But I don't think voters are saying ‘Oh, great President Biden is here.’ And on the flip side, undecided voters I don't think are saying ‘I really miss Trump, let's go for his guy.’ … I think a lot of voters will be looking at it and say I don't want a 2020 choice in 2022. I want a new person.”\n Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Christopher Cadelago and Meridith McGraw","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/6f/18/10d55dd847dd91782543842dec5c/diptych-trump-joe.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"The stops foreshadow a likely 2024 rematch and escalate the posturing between the two that’s been simmering since Biden vanquished Trump two years ago, thanks in large part to reclaiming Pennsylvania.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/6f/18/10d55dd847dd91782543842dec5c/diptych-trump-joe.jpg"}}]},"content":"The two men are hitting the state as part of their midterm swings.

Twitter didn’t respond when asked if Trump had been invited back on, and Trump’s personal account (@realDonaldTrump) is still suspended as of Friday afternoon. In a post on his own platform, Truth Social, he wrote, “I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands.” He told Fox News on Friday, “I am staying on Truth. I like it better, I like the way it works, I like Elon, but I’m staying on Truth.”\n “Long-term catastrophe”\n Many of the closest observers of Twitter, both left and right, focused on the departure of Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s top lawyer and policy chief, who Musk reportedly fired last night. (Gadde has not commented, but her Twitter bio no longer lists her at the company.)\n Over the past few years, Gadde had emerged as the face of the platform’s free-speech and content-moderation policies, infuriating conservatives who thought she unfairly de-platformed Trump — while reassuring liberals with her views on the importance of maintaining civil discourse.\n Gadde’s removal is a “long-term catastrophe,” said Jesse Lehrich, co-founder of watchdog nonprofit Accountable Tech. “She’s the moral compass and clear-eyed leader of the sort of decision making team there on everything from standing up to laws that violate human rights from authoritarian regimes … to making decisions on election integrity violations and hate speech in the U.S.”\n Civil rights groups raised alarms on the timing of her removal — just 11 days before the midterms. “That we could predict it doesn’t make it any less concerning,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Leaving Twitter without someone in this critical role when it’s arguably needed most is really worrisome.”\n With Musk’s assurance that he wouldn’t make “major” changes prior to establishing the moderation board he also promised prior to the deal closing on Thursday that the site wouldn’t become a “free-for-all hellscape,\" in a post aimed at worried advertisers. Yet, he’s also said he wants fewer rules over what people can say and do on the platform.\n \n Technical experts say it’s unlikely Twitter’s content moderation systems will change quickly, even without its former policy chief. Katie Harbath, the former public policy director at Facebook who oversaw their elections work, said it’s not that easy to turn off some of the algorithms that are set to proactively detect and remove misinformation and hate speech.\n “You can’t turn and change these classifiers on a dime – you can turn them off – but you can’t really adjust. That takes time to do,” Harbath said.\n Even so, there are signs Musk’s takeover has liberated some darker impulses in the American conversation. The Network Contagion Research Institute, an independent center that tracks online trends, says it has measured an uptick in the use of at least one racial slur in the 12 hours since the Musk buyout.\n The new owner is also attracting attention on Capitol Hill.\n “As Mr. Musk takes the reins, I will be watching to see if the company maintains its commitment to promote healthy dialogue, free from disinformation and harassment,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce panel on consumer protection. “Mr. Musk has a lot to prove because just this week, we saw the Department of Justice open an investigation into his other venture, Tesla.\"\n “In Trumpworld a lot of people go back and forth”\n In the hours since Musk’s takeover, MAGA-world has celebrated an owner it sees as a potential savior of “free speech.” Several MAGA-related accounts called on Musk to remove alleged “shadow-bans” — which they claim have prevented them from posting. For instance, Musk tweeted on Friday he’d look into claims from a user called “Catturd2” — who was previously retweeted by Trump for spreading election lies and supporting the former president. The user said their supposed “search ban” was lifted today.\n The biggest potential game-changer, of course, would be the return of Trump himself, who previously had more than 88 million followers.\n For the former president, it’s now a more complicated question, since he runs — and is a key draw for — Truth Social, launched the year after Twitter banned his account. That platform is friendlier to his ideas and supporters but has far fewer followers, and less reach.\n \n \n “In Trumpworld a lot of people go back and forth on whether he should or shouldn’t [return to Twitter],” said a person who speaks to Trump regularly, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n “It's like if reporters share his Truths on Twitter, what's the point of going back on Twitter? That’s the prevailing thought, there’s really no need to get back on.”\n In the small ecosystem of right-leaning social platforms, which stand to lose users if Musk makes Twitter feel friendlier to the Trump movement, leaders pushed back at the idea that the entrepreneur would be able to quickly change Twitter’s culture and standards.\n “So far it’s only free speech lip service from Elon Musk. Come back to me when he reinstates President Trump,” said GETTR CEO and former Trump adviser Jason Miller in an interview. He later added, “Unless Elon Musk fires every coder, every engineer and every moderator in the entire company and starts all over, political discrimination is going to persist at Twitter. It’s too fundamentally rooted in their culture.”\n George Farmer, CEO of Parler, the platform that was recently sold to Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, said Musk’s acquisition showed that his attempt to make Twitter a “freewheeling platform” came at a “significant price,” noting the $44 billion price tag. He said Twitter won’t stop Parler’s efforts to build a “truly uncancelable ecosystem.”\n “I look at Twitter like a petri dish”\n For Democrats, the announcement could hardly have come at a worse time — with Republicans likely to take the House next month and Trump widely expected to run for president again.\n Trump looms large in their worries — “The minute he’s back on Twitter, he immediately has the attention of tens of tens of millions of followers, tens of millions of people, and every media person who I believe will stay on Twitter,” said Adam Loewy, a Texas lawyer and Democratic donor, said Friday — but he’s not the whole story.\n Musk, who has described himself as a “free speech absolutist,” doesn’t hide where he’s coming from politically, which has significant implications for the left.\n \n \n On Twitter in May, Musk called the Democratic Party “the party of division & hate.” And Twitter, though smaller than some other social media platforms, is an influential place for the billionaire SpaceX and Tesla CEO to be saying that kind of thing.\n Never mind the overall user base, which Pew Research Center puts at about a quarter of U.S. adults. Rather, it’s who’s watching: Politicians, campaign strategists, activists and, perhaps most importantly, news producers and editors. Campaigns use the platform to test messages they later launch on TV. One attack ad against Republican Herschel Walker in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race features a narrator reading from a post on Twitter by Walker’s son.\n “It’s certainly useful in setting the narrative with reporters, and also getting influencers who have their own separate platforms, email lists, intrigued with something, whatever you’re pushing at the moment,” said John Thomas, a Republican strategist who works on House campaigns across the country. “I look at Twitter like a petri dish. It’s where ideas can go to die or grow. It’s where message themes can die or grow.”\n Right now, despite all the hand-wringing about abusive speech or censorship, the overwhelming majority of the political world is on it — hard-right stars like Rep. Matt Gaetz are just as much a presence as the Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezes of the world.\n If a partisan, highly volatile owner steps in and changes things, it may become less appealing to the reporters, activists and politicians who now call it home.\n “At least on Twitter, as much as we fight as Americans, we’re on the same platform,” said Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist who was a co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project.\n “It’s not like we’re having a healthy exchange of ideas. We’re calling each other pedophiles, racists and grifters, but at least we’re doing it on the same platform. Without Twitter, what is there?”\n Madrid, like many observers, was initially doubtful that the sale would go through.

But standing in the back of the room, by a table of auction items — a red, white and blue Kate Spade bag, a Trump 2024 hat, a mug that said Trump “won” — it struck me that given the composition of the audience, this was a strange thing for a Republican Party chair to have to say. In this heavily conservative state, reminding Republicans to vote Republican would seem to signal a big problem in the GOP.</p> <p>Republicans were rattled earlier this year when Palin, a one-time political sensation and one of the GOP’s original populists, lost a special election for a vacant congressional seat to a Democrat, Mary Peltola. They pointed fingers at Alaska’s new ranked choice voting system, in which a voter’s second choice — if their preferred candidate fell short — could help decide the outcome. The system is meant to weed out extreme candidates, and true to form only about half of voters who supported Nick Begich III, a more traditionalist Republican and the candidate endorsed by the state party, <a href=\"https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/RcvDetailedReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666304148072,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666304148072,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/RcvDetailedReport.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f777-dc6e-a59f-f77779d80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;had marked Palin as their second choice&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f777-dc6e-a59f-f77779d80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">had marked Palin as their second choice</a>.</p> <p>The result was a repudiation of Palin, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384?s=20&amp;t=sITAR-eGytbqWxgXN9HucA\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;uniquely unpopular&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1552833494220304384?s=20&amp;t=sITAR-eGytbqWxgXN9HucA&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71880001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">uniquely unpopular</a> figure in Alaska following her vice presidential candidacy in 2008 and her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;abrupt and not-well-explained&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71880002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71880003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">abrupt and not-well-explained</a> resignation from the Alaska governorship the following year.

And for the first time in nearly 50 years, Alaska had sent a Democrat to the House. It probably wouldn’t have happened without Alaska’s unusual ranked choice voting system. The state hadn’t turned Democratic overnight, after all. But it was possible that Palin’s loss had revealed something alarming for Republicans about the limitations of a MAGA personality’s appeal in the post-Donald Trump presidential era — not just in Alaska, but in the Lower 48, as well.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/d2/24/bba1bb3046a9b4b18dec3400c3b7/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>“It’s crazy,” said Jim Minnery, executive director of the conservative Alaska Family Council.</p> <p>“It was insane,” said Chris Berns, a commercial fisherman I met at a meet-and-greet hosted by the state’s moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. “I couldn’t even believe it.”</p> <p>Nor could many of the Republicans at the dinner in Wasilla, where Brown channeled Benjamin Franklin: “Republicans, if we don’t hang together, we are going to hang separately.”</p> <p>Even some Republicans in the room weren’t sure they could avoid it. The stakes had been lower in the special election, with Republicans ceding the seat to Peltola for a matter of months after the death of Rep. Don Young. But now in the regular election — in which Alaskans are about to run the same contest all over again for a full, two-year term — it isn’t clear anything had changed.</p> <p>Palin, who initially told her supporters not to rank a second choice on the ballot, has since changed tack. When I met her following a candidate debate on fisheries earlier this month, she told me she’d decided to “swallow my pride and say, ‘Go ahead and comply’” because “politically speaking, you’ve got to strategize to get second- and third-place votes.” She didn’t like doing it, though. It “goes against every competitive bone in my body,” Palin said. But “otherwise, the math,” she said, “it’ll just play out exactly as it just did.”</p> <p>But recognizing the math is one thing. Agreeing to a ceasefire is something else entirely — especially when Palin and Begich are essentially competing to finish second to Peltola in the first round of voting, only then hoping to leapfrog the Democrat when the second-place votes are tallied. It was only last month that Palin was calling on Begich to drop out of the race, disparaging him as “delusional” for suggesting that he — not Palin — was the only Republican who could win. She described him to me as engaging in “politics of personal destruction.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3c/f1/2f091f3d4b50a47c265145b3d5b3/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>All along — far before Palin got on board — Begich had encouraged his supporters to mark Palin second on their ballots. But he has also cast Palin as a “quitter” incapable of beating Peltola. And in his effort to contrast his candidacy with hers, he has not been above provocation. He has distributed buttons <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/from-gipper-to-hockey-mom-079150\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;poking Palin&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/from-gipper-to-hockey-mom-079150&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71880008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71880009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">poking Palin</a>’s brand that say, “Another hockey mom for Nick Begich.”</p> <p>In the parking lot of the restaurant where the Republicans met, Aaron Coman, the owner of a hit music station in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, shook his head at the animosity between the two Republicans. He said he’d appealed personally to both Palin’s and Begich’s campaigns to “stop beating each other up.”</p> <p>“If you continue to bash each other, we’re going to get another Mary Peltola win,” he said. “And that’s a fact.”</p> <p>But when I asked if he was confident the result would be any different in November, he said, “No.”</p> <p>Normally, a party goes through a primary, takes their shots at each other, and then coalesces around a nominee. But in Alaska, where ranked choice voting has everyone still running against one another, “really what it’s doing is splitting up the Republicans, in goodwill and also votes,” said Kathy McCollum, president of the Mat-Su Republican Women’s Club, which hosted the event where Brown spoke.</p> <p>She said, “It’s really caused a lot of grief.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>If Alaska’s voting system</b> is unusual, the issues and logistics of campaigning here are something else, too.</p> <p>One recent morning, Begich and Murkowski, piled onto the same Alaska Airlines flight from Anchorage to the city of Kodiak, located on an island about 30 miles off the coast where, despite the pilot’s warning that inclement weather might force them to turn back, they landed in heavy rain to attend, along with Palin and Peltola, a series of candidate debates focused on fisheries. (On the return flight, Begich and Murkowski shared a row, and Peltola sat across from them: “I’m on the inside, Nick,” Murkowski said when she boarded.)</p> <p>In a high school auditorium, the House candidates fielded <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-bycatch#:~:text=foster%20innovative%20solutions%3F-,What%20is%20bycatch%3F,or%20entangled%20in%20fishing%20gear.\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666304636148,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666304636148,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-bycatch#:~:text=foster%20innovative%20solutions%3F-,What%20is%20bycatch%3F,or%20entangled%20in%20fishing%20gear.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f77e-d8b3-afd3-f7ffeef20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;questions about bycatch&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000183-f77e-d8b3-afd3-f7ffeef20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">questions about bycatch</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-science-lifestyle-business-environment-and-nature-cb0c966f43e52fd9559857969f1203a0\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;dwindling salmon populations&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-science-lifestyle-business-environment-and-nature-cb0c966f43e52fd9559857969f1203a0&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71890000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71890001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">dwindling salmon populations</a> and the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which governs fishing in federal waters, and about whether they had ever fished commercially, what kind of white fish is their favorite and, “How often do you eat seafood?”</p> <p>“I’d say I eat seafood about four or five times a week,” Peltola said. “And if I’m not eating seafood, I’m eating moose meat.”</p> <p>Murkowski, after de-planing in Kodiak, told me that ranked choice voting had introduced a “newfound freedom for individuals to be released from the construct that the parties had put in place.” For Murkowski, a pro-abortion rights Republican who supported Trump’s second impeachment, it’s the support of moderates, independents and crossover Democrats that has kept her in the Senate — and will keep her there if she can defeat a Trump-backed challenger, Kelly Tshibaka, in November.</p> <p>Ranked choice voting, Murkowski said, has “prompted the independence that I think is just inherent in Alaskans.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/7a/9b/26a26c3341d38e486ad31ef94cd5/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>This is the read of the House race in Alaska in much of the Lower 48, as well.

But sometimes personalities can detract from the message itself, and with some of these MAGA, cult-like personalities, independents are looking at whether they want that candidate not based on the issue set but based on personality.”</p> <p>That might all change if Republicans succeed in focusing more attention on the country’s economic woes, “because when they go up to fill up their car with gas, they’re pissed off,” Thomas said. “But it certainly is making it more of an uphill battle than it needs to be.”</p> <p>At the Donut King restaurant in Wasilla, where Begich hosted a gathering of supporters recently, I spoke with Matthew Hebb, a political strategist from Idaho who had traveled to Alaska to knock on doors for Begich. He was optimistic about Begich’s prospects on Nov. 8. But he told me that divisions in the GOP are already leading to electoral losses: “Republicans are going to lose some critical elections in places that are easily winnable through these separations, and they’re going to have to realize they have to learn how to get along.”</p> <p>In Alaska, the gulf between Palin and Begich supporters may simply be too wide. Palin’s problem is largely reputational — resented for leaving her governorship before her term was over or mocked for dancing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLwfHwR0ps\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in a pink bear costume on TV&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLwfHwR0ps&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b718a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b718a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">in a pink bear costume on TV</a>. Begich, the scion of one of the most prominent <i>Democratic</i> families in Alaska, is saddled with his family name.</p> <p>The grandson of the late Rep. Nick Begich Sr. and nephew of former Sen. Mark Begich, Begich was raised by his mother’s conservative side of the family. He was co-chair of Young’s 2020 reelection campaign and of the Alaska Republican Party’s finance committee. He told me he would have voted to certify the 2020 presidential election, and he is otherwise within the mainstream of the GOP.</p> <p>Still, Mike Shower, a Republican state senator who was at Begich’s gathering at the donut shop, said, “What I have heard people say to me specifically is I will never vote for a Begich … If he was Nick Johnson, he would have probably won this hands down.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a4/0f/0c33fa3740908952c408ef728747/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary5.png\"> <br> <p>Shower said that after Peltola’s victory, “People have asked the question, ‘What the heck happened?’” And he was optimistic that “we will convince a certain number of people to put Nick and Sarah down as one and two in whatever order works for them, and I’m hoping that that’s going to push us across the edge this time.”</p> <p>Mead Treadwell, the state’s former Republican lieutenant governor, said that ever since the special election, “there has really been a concerted effort by a number of people” to push the party’s message of “rank the red” — that is, pick a Republican as the second choice. However, he said, “How well it works is a good question, because it’s not up to the party, it’s up to the voters.”</p> <p>And what do they think? In the closing leg of the House campaign — at the restaurant fundraiser in Wasilla, at a hockey game and at church with Begich and at gatherings of Republicans in Kodiak and in Anchorage — I ran into many Republicans who <i>do</i> plan to fall in line with the party, ranking Begich and Palin first and second, or vice versa. But there was no shortage of conservatives who still refuse to. They say things like:</p> <p><i>“It’s just going to be Sarah.”</i></p> <p><i>“Sarah can’t win, so you’ve got to put Nick first.”</i></p> <p><i>“No second choice.”</i></p> <p><i>“Palin has a louder voice, but man, that voice is so hard to listen to.”</i></p> <p><i>“If we put Sarah in there, I feel [God] is going to punish us.”</i></p> <p><i>“I just wanted to come to a hockey game and get away from the politics.”</i><br></p> <br> <p><b>On the night of </b>the fisheries debate in Kodiak, Palin and Peltola wore matching earrings shaped like buoys. The two politicians were friendly from when Palin’s time as governor overlapped with Peltola’s tenure in the state legislature, and Peltola, Palin said, had given her a pair.</p> <p>“I love her,” Palin said. “We just represent two different parties, obviously, but two different platforms.” The competition isn’t “personal,” Palin said. “I think it’s an Alaska chick thing, too … It’s like, we support each other.”</p> <p>The difficulty for Palin — and for the Republican Party here — is that Alaskans may like Peltola just as much as she does.</p> <p>In her campaign literature, Peltola presents herself as “pro-choice,” “pro-fish” and “pro-jobs.” In her TV advertising, she appeals to moderates, casting herself as a defender of Alaska as a “resource extraction state.” She has a bumper sticker that reads, “Made of Salmon” and a flyer carried by door-knockers suggests people “vote for a REGULAR ALASKAN.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/85/1b/60e173c34fed8ce3f52e95ec1797/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p>Her campaign is resonating. In a recent poll by longtime Alaska pollster Ivan Moore of Alaska Survey Research, Peltola’s favorability rating hit 53 percent.

I think Alaskans, I think Americans are just sick and tired of hearing people squabbling … I do not take any pleasure in that.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/cd/dc/6e8e9554470bb7304ca5cb085eea/tfr.Siders.AlaskaHouse-Secondary7.png\"> <br> <p>But other Democrats are reveling in it.</p> <p>Pat Chesbro, the Democrat running against Murkowski and Tshibaka in the U.S. Senate campaign, will almost certainly lose her race. But in the House contest, Chesbro said, Peltola is “so good,” even if she “would not have done well without ranked choice voting.”</p> <p>“The interesting thing,” Chesbro said, “is if you have a party whose two candidates fight each other, that gives an advantage to the other person in a three-way race.”</p> <p>Nobody knows that better than Republicans in Alaska. Cynthia Henry, the Republican national committeewoman from the state, said Peltola’s victory was a “rude awakening for folks.”</p> <p>Leaving the debate in Kodiak last week, Palin, amid a handful of photograph seekers, was met by a fisherman who commiserated with her about the system.</p> <p>“Ugghhhh,” she said when I asked her about it. “It’s not good.”<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"WASILLA, Alaska — In a restaurant ballroom just up the road from Sarah Palin’s home on Lake Lucille, a room full of Republicans one recent Saturday night hung golden balloons from a paneled ceiling, lined up at the bar and held a drawing for a “wall of guns.”\n The event was a fundraiser for a local Republican women’s group, and one of the speakers, Ann Brown, the state Republican Party chair, had a very specific ask.\n Vote for Republicans in November’s ranked choice election, she said, “and no Democrats or any other party.”\n The crowd applauded. But standing in the back of the room, by a table of auction items — a red, white and blue Kate Spade bag, a Trump 2024 hat, a mug that said Trump “won” — it struck me that given the composition of the audience, this was a strange thing for a Republican Party chair to have to say. In this heavily conservative state, reminding Republicans to vote Republican would seem to signal a big problem in the GOP.\n Republicans were rattled earlier this year when Palin, a one-time political sensation and one of the GOP’s original populists, lost a special election for a vacant congressional seat to a Democrat, Mary Peltola. They pointed fingers at Alaska’s new ranked choice voting system, in which a voter’s second choice — if their preferred candidate fell short — could help decide the outcome. The system is meant to weed out extreme candidates, and true to form only about half of voters who supported Nick Begich III, a more traditionalist Republican and the candidate endorsed by the state party, had marked Palin as their second choice.\n The result was a repudiation of Palin, a uniquely unpopular figure in Alaska following her vice presidential candidacy in 2008 and her abrupt and not-well-explained resignation from the Alaska governorship the following year. But the special election also laid bare exactly how much Republicans were willing to lose in the seemingly ceaseless feud between the party’s Trumpian and more establishment-minded bases of support.\n Independents — a majority of the Alaska electorate and a critical set of voters to both parties in more competitive states — had pulled away from Palin. In a state that Donald Trump carried by 10 percentage points in 2020, Alaska’s closest approximation to the former president hit a wall. And for the first time in nearly 50 years, Alaska had sent a Democrat to the House. It probably wouldn’t have happened without Alaska’s unusual ranked choice voting system. The state hadn’t turned Democratic overnight, after all. But it was possible that Palin’s loss had revealed something alarming for Republicans about the limitations of a MAGA personality’s appeal in the post-Donald Trump presidential era — not just in Alaska, but in the Lower 48, as well.\n \n  \n “It’s crazy,” said Jim Minnery, executive director of the conservative Alaska Family Council.\n “It was insane,” said Chris Berns, a commercial fisherman I met at a meet-and-greet hosted by the state’s moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. “I couldn’t even believe it.”\n Nor could many of the Republicans at the dinner in Wasilla, where Brown channeled Benjamin Franklin: “Republicans, if we don’t hang together, we are going to hang separately.”\n Even some Republicans in the room weren’t sure they could avoid it. The stakes had been lower in the special election, with Republicans ceding the seat to Peltola for a matter of months after the death of Rep. Don Young. But now in the regular election — in which Alaskans are about to run the same contest all over again for a full, two-year term — it isn’t clear anything had changed.\n Palin, who initially told her supporters not to rank a second choice on the ballot, has since changed tack. When I met her following a candidate debate on fisheries earlier this month, she told me she’d decided to “swallow my pride and say, ‘Go ahead and comply’” because “politically speaking, you’ve got to strategize to get second- and third-place votes.” She didn’t like doing it, though. It “goes against every competitive bone in my body,” Palin said. But “otherwise, the math,” she said, “it’ll just play out exactly as it just did.”\n But recognizing the math is one thing. Agreeing to a ceasefire is something else entirely — especially when Palin and Begich are essentially competing to finish second to Peltola in the first round of voting, only then hoping to leapfrog the Democrat when the second-place votes are tallied. It was only last month that Palin was calling on Begich to drop out of the race, disparaging him as “delusional” for suggesting that he — not Palin — was the only Republican who could win. She described him to me as engaging in “politics of personal destruction.”\n \n  \n All along — far before Palin got on board — Begich had encouraged his supporters to mark Palin second on their ballots. But he has also cast Palin as a “quitter” incapable of beating Peltola. And in his effort to contrast his candidacy with hers, he has not been above provocation. He has distributed buttons poking Palin’s brand that say, “Another hockey mom for Nick Begich.”\n In the parking lot of the restaurant where the Republicans met, Aaron Coman, the owner of a hit music station in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, shook his head at the animosity between the two Republicans. He said he’d appealed personally to both Palin’s and Begich’s campaigns to “stop beating each other up.”\n “If you continue to bash each other, we’re going to get another Mary Peltola win,” he said. “And that’s a fact.”\n But when I asked if he was confident the result would be any different in November, he said, “No.”\n Normally, a party goes through a primary, takes their shots at each other, and then coalesces around a nominee. But in Alaska, where ranked choice voting has everyone still running against one another, “really what it’s doing is splitting up the Republicans, in goodwill and also votes,” said Kathy McCollum, president of the Mat-Su Republican Women’s Club, which hosted the event where Brown spoke.\n She said, “It’s really caused a lot of grief.”\n \n If Alaska’s voting system is unusual, the issues and logistics of campaigning here are something else, too.\n One recent morning, Begich and Murkowski, piled onto the same Alaska Airlines flight from Anchorage to the city of Kodiak, located on an island about 30 miles off the coast where, despite the pilot’s warning that inclement weather might force them to turn back, they landed in heavy rain to attend, along with Palin and Peltola, a series of candidate debates focused on fisheries. (On the return flight, Begich and Murkowski shared a row, and Peltola sat across from them: “I’m on the inside, Nick,” Murkowski said when she boarded.)\n In a high school auditorium, the House candidates fielded questions about bycatch, dwindling salmon populations and the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which governs fishing in federal waters, and about whether they had ever fished commercially, what kind of white fish is their favorite and, “How often do you eat seafood?”\n “I’d say I eat seafood about four or five times a week,” Peltola said. “And if I’m not eating seafood, I’m eating moose meat.”\n Murkowski, after de-planing in Kodiak, told me that ranked choice voting had introduced a “newfound freedom for individuals to be released from the construct that the parties had put in place.” For Murkowski, a pro-abortion rights Republican who supported Trump’s second impeachment, it’s the support of moderates, independents and crossover Democrats that has kept her in the Senate — and will keep her there if she can defeat a Trump-backed challenger, Kelly Tshibaka, in November.\n Ranked choice voting, Murkowski said, has “prompted the independence that I think is just inherent in Alaskans.”\n \n  \n This is the read of the House race in Alaska in much of the Lower 48, as well. To them, the failure of Republicans to hold Alaska’s House seat is all about ranked choice voting — or the weirdness of the vast, sparsely populated 49th state.\n “Alaska’s kind of its own, different animal up there,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster. “I think a lot of it, it’s personality-driven in a place like that.”\n But Alaska is not the only state where the politics of personality are being tested in the GOP, and it’s possible that the difficulties Republicans are having here are less an outlier than an early indication of a specific problem for the party in states where Republicans have nominated candidates as polarizing as Palin — and where independents are keeping Democrats afloat.\n \n \n \nRepublicans are still widely expected to win the House in November. But the large number of voters who are unaffiliated with either party in Alaska — about 58 percent — may be telling the GOP something about its future in more competitive states, as well. The proportion of people nationally who identify as independent has been growing in recent decades, according to Gallup, now accounting for about 43 percent of American adults. That may not be a problem for Republicans broadly in November. In a New York Times/Siena College poll that was ricocheting around Democratic Party circles this week, independents were breaking for Republicans by a 10 percentage point margin over Democrats on the generic congressional ballot.\n But the polling is mixed. One recent CBS News/YouGov survey showed independents favoring Democrats over Republicans in congressional elections by a narrow margin. President Joe Biden’s approval rating — a measure closely tied to a party’s performance in the midterms — is still dismal with independent voters, at 39 percent, according to an NPR/Marist poll released earlier this month. Still, that’s a dramatic improvement from July, when his approval rating among independents was 11 percentage points worse.\n \n Where Republicans do appear vulnerable with independents are places the party is running candidates like Trump, who carried independents by 6 percentage points in 2016, according to exit polls, before losing them to Biden by 13 percentage points four years later. There are a lot of similar hard-liners running this year, including in Alaska, where independents are far more likely to view Peltola favorably than Palin: The Democrat is running 26 percentage points ahead of Palin with independents who rank at least one of them, according to one recent poll.\n And in other states where Republicans have nominated Trumpian standard-bearers, it’s a similar story. It’s one reason Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is making a competitive run for Senate in Republican-heavy Ohio, where a Marist Poll last month had Ryan up 2 percentage points over Republican J.D. Vance with independents. In Georgia’s Senate race, Republican Herschel Walker is running 15 percentage points behind Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock among independents, according to a Quinnipiac University poll, while incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, a more traditionalist Republican, is faring far better. In Pennsylvania, Republican Mehmet Oz is down double digits among independents, as well.\n Those numbers may shift back toward Republicans as Election Day nears and partisan leanings solidify. But between moderate Republicans defecting from Trumpian Republicans like Palin and the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade — just as much an issue in Alaska as anywhere else, with polls suggesting a majority of Alaskans support abortion rights — the most polarizing Republicans, like Palin, have reason for concern.\n \n  \n What may be happening in Alaska and elsewhere, said Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster, is that “things are collapsing toward the middle.”\n “The galaxies have been running away from each other for a good decade or more, and maybe now they’re spinning back a little bit more toward each other,” he said, in what he called a potential “regression to the mean.”\n John Thomas, a Republican strategist who works on House campaigns across the country, said, “My take on it is that sometimes personalities can be incredibly useful in politics. But sometimes personalities can detract from the message itself, and with some of these MAGA, cult-like personalities, independents are looking at whether they want that candidate not based on the issue set but based on personality.”\n That might all change if Republicans succeed in focusing more attention on the country’s economic woes, “because when they go up to fill up their car with gas, they’re pissed off,” Thomas said. “But it certainly is making it more of an uphill battle than it needs to be.”\n At the Donut King restaurant in Wasilla, where Begich hosted a gathering of supporters recently, I spoke with Matthew Hebb, a political strategist from Idaho who had traveled to Alaska to knock on doors for Begich. He was optimistic about Begich’s prospects on Nov. 8. But he told me that divisions in the GOP are already leading to electoral losses: “Republicans are going to lose some critical elections in places that are easily winnable through these separations, and they’re going to have to realize they have to learn how to get along.”\n In Alaska, the gulf between Palin and Begich supporters may simply be too wide. Palin’s problem is largely reputational — resented for leaving her governorship before her term was over or mocked for dancing in a pink bear costume on TV. Begich, the scion of one of the most prominent Democratic families in Alaska, is saddled with his family name.\n The grandson of the late Rep. Nick Begich Sr. and nephew of former Sen. Mark Begich, Begich was raised by his mother’s conservative side of the family. He was co-chair of Young’s 2020 reelection campaign and of the Alaska Republican Party’s finance committee. He told me he would have voted to certify the 2020 presidential election, and he is otherwise within the mainstream of the GOP.\n Still, Mike Shower, a Republican state senator who was at Begich’s gathering at the donut shop, said, “What I have heard people say to me specifically is I will never vote for a Begich … If he was Nick Johnson, he would have probably won this hands down.”\n \n  \n Shower said that after Peltola’s victory, “People have asked the question, ‘What the heck happened?’” And he was optimistic that “we will convince a certain number of people to put Nick and Sarah down as one and two in whatever order works for them, and I’m hoping that that’s going to push us across the edge this time.”\n Mead Treadwell, the state’s former Republican lieutenant governor, said that ever since the special election, “there has really been a concerted effort by a number of people” to push the party’s message of “rank the red” — that is, pick a Republican as the second choice. However, he said, “How well it works is a good question, because it’s not up to the party, it’s up to the voters.”\n And what do they think? In the closing leg of the House campaign — at the restaurant fundraiser in Wasilla, at a hockey game and at church with Begich and at gatherings of Republicans in Kodiak and in Anchorage — I ran into many Republicans who do plan to fall in line with the party, ranking Begich and Palin first and second, or vice versa. But there was no shortage of conservatives who still refuse to. They say things like:\n “It’s just going to be Sarah.”\n “Sarah can’t win, so you’ve got to put Nick first.”\n “No second choice.”\n “Palin has a louder voice, but man, that voice is so hard to listen to.”\n “If we put Sarah in there, I feel [God] is going to punish us.”\n “I just wanted to come to a hockey game and get away from the politics.”\n \n On the night of the fisheries debate in Kodiak, Palin and Peltola wore matching earrings shaped like buoys. The two politicians were friendly from when Palin’s time as governor overlapped with Peltola’s tenure in the state legislature, and Peltola, Palin said, had given her a pair.\n “I love her,” Palin said. “We just represent two different parties, obviously, but two different platforms.” The competition isn’t “personal,” Palin said. “I think it’s an Alaska chick thing, too … It’s like, we support each other.”\n The difficulty for Palin — and for the Republican Party here — is that Alaskans may like Peltola just as much as she does.\n In her campaign literature, Peltola presents herself as “pro-choice,” “pro-fish” and “pro-jobs.” In her TV advertising, she appeals to moderates, casting herself as a defender of Alaska as a “resource extraction state.” She has a bumper sticker that reads, “Made of Salmon” and a flyer carried by door-knockers suggests people “vote for a REGULAR ALASKAN.”\n \n  \n Her campaign is resonating. In a recent poll by longtime Alaska pollster Ivan Moore of Alaska Survey Research, Peltola’s favorability rating hit 53 percent. Moore said on Twitter at the time that she “is categorically the most popular figure in AK right now.” Peltola, Moore told me, is “in the midst of a pretty good little honeymoon going on,” while Palin and Begich “haven’t really been very smart between the two of them, just going at each other.”\n Recent polling suggests Palin and Begich are once again splitting the Republican vote — Palin with a fervent base of support, but not enough to lift her above 50 percent. Which is, after all, part of the idea driving more states to consider ranked choice voting, something Nevada voters will weigh in on in November. Proponents believe it helps boost more likable, less-partisan candidates over polarizing ones. The more extremist and uncompromising, the more likely a party is to lose.\n The problem for Republicans isn’t the party, Begich said, but Palin, whose polling is so polarizing that it would be for her “almost impossible to win a general election.”\n When I suggested to Peltola, the first Alaska Native elected to Congress, that she must be enjoying the self-harm the other side is inflicting on itself, she insisted that she isn’t. “No, I actually don’t love it, no,” she said. “Because I think that it turns off voters. I think Alaskans, I think Americans are just sick and tired of hearing people squabbling … I do not take any pleasure in that.”\n \n  \n But other Democrats are reveling in it.\n Pat Chesbro, the Democrat running against Murkowski and Tshibaka in the U.S. Senate campaign, will almost certainly lose her race. But in the House contest, Chesbro said, Peltola is “so good,” even if she “would not have done well without ranked choice voting.”\n “The interesting thing,” Chesbro said, “is if you have a party whose two candidates fight each other, that gives an advantage to the other person in a three-way race.”\n Nobody knows that better than Republicans in Alaska. Cynthia Henry, the Republican national committeewoman from the state, said Peltola’s victory was a “rude awakening for folks.”\n Leaving the debate in Kodiak last week, Palin, amid a handful of photograph seekers, was met by a fisherman who commiserated with her about the system.\n “Ugghhhh,” she said when I asked her about it. “It’s not good.”","dc:creator":"David Siders","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/cc/48/888534374838916eaa1ef92ba21c/mag.Siders.AlaskaIllustration.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/AP Photos/iStock","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Mag.TFR.Siders.AlaskaIllustration","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/cc/48/888534374838916eaa1ef92ba21c/mag.Siders.AlaskaIllustration.jpg"}}]},"content":"Liberated by ranked choice voting, they seem poised to swing dramatically toward Democrats.

Elections are, once again, bringing far-right nationalist leaders to power around the world. For decades, representative democracies have allowed for increasing accumulation of wealth at the top and growing precarity for the working classes — a fertile ground for the far right to capitalize on discontent.\n Far-right leaders are selling popular empowerment based on the discrimination and oppression of “the other”: immigrants, gender dissidents, feminists, religious minorities, left-wing “radicals,” the indigenous and the poor. Meanwhile, mainstream progressive governments have consistently failed to deliver broadly shared prosperity and economic security. It should not be so surprising then that people have ended up supporting a kind of politics that at least gives them symbolic power.\n The far right is currently ruling in: Hungary with Viktor Orbán, who has come out against race mixing in Europe and was a speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas this summer; Poland with the Christian nationalist party, Law and Justice, which opposes gay marriage, abortion and immigration; India, the most populous representative democracy in the world, with Narendra Modi, who has pursued Hindu-nationalist policies against religious minorities; Turkey with the imposition of Islamic nationalism and the ethnic cleansing against Kurds by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; Brazil with Jair Bolsonaro, who has denounced “homosexual fundamentalists,” called indigenous peoples “parasites” and advanced agribusiness by promoting the burning of the Amazon basin; and more recently, Italy with Giorgia Meloni, heir to Mussolini’s fascist legacy, the new prime minister after her right-wing coalition achieved a majority in Parliament.\n The current surge of MAGA Republicans running for Congress and Donald Trump’s likely 2024 bid to reclaim the White House are part of this trend.\n \n \n But to better understand the rise of the global far right, look to the two most recent elections involving Christian nationalist candidates: the presidential and congressional elections in Brazil and the parliamentary election in Italy. In both, far-right leaders have effectively appealed to ethnicity — particularly religion — and used largely unregulated social media platforms to amplify propaganda and “fake news” that further normalizes extreme ideas and the demand to establish discriminatory policies.\n The far right paved its way to power in Brazil, the largest Latin American economy, after launching attacks on the leaders of the ruling Workers’ Party (PT). In 2016, through lawfare — the misuse of rules and procedures as a political weapon — Congress impeached and removed President Dilma Rousseff on charges of accounting irregularities (which were later dismissed), and the courts prosecuted former President Lula da Silva on corruption charges in a trial that did not respect due process (and where the judge and lead prosecutor conspired to convict him so he could not run for president in 2018).\n After Lula was arrested, Bolsonaro, an ex-military officer who called Hitler “a great strategist” and believes Brazil is “a Christian country,” became the front runner and was elected in a runoff with 55 percent of the vote. Bolsonaro has spent the last four years in office divisively governing as the “Trump of the Tropics.”\n On Oct. 2, Bolsonaro faced a rematch with Lula, who was ultimately vindicated after wrongfully spending 548 days in prison. In the first round of the Brazilian presidential election, Lula came in first, with 48 percent of the vote — two points short of the majority to win outright. Bolsonaro, who had campaigned to “make Brazil great,” took second place with 43 percent of the vote — seven points more than any poll had forecasted.\n Perhaps the most important factor at the end of the campaign was the proliferation of fake news stating that Lula would persecute Christians and close churches if elected, which helped Bolsonaro lure centrist votes to his side.\n Bolsonaro constantly used religion on the trail as a cultural identity marker in a bid to re-impose eroded patriarchal hierarchies and traditions. Issues such as abortion and transgender rights were at the center of the debate for evangelical Christians, who account for a third of Brazilians and were among Bolsonaro’s strongest supporters. Evangelical churches had also actively campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018, and in return received tax exemptions, appointments to several ministries, the removal of LGBTQ protections from public guidelines and a pastor in the Supreme Court. It’s a replay of what happened in the United States: Evangelical Christians were instrumental in Trump’s 2016 election, and he then delivered a Supreme Court that overturned abortion rights.\n \n In addition to the surprisingly high support for Bolsonaro, his far-right allies did tremendously well in the elections for Congress, consolidating their grip on the legislative process through an alliance that now controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate. More than a third of the lower house and 10 percent of the Senate are controlled by the Evangelical Parliamentary Front.\n This means that even if Lula defeats Bolsonaro in the runoff election on Oct. 30, he will have to deal with an aggressive conservative Congress, willing to block legislation and impeach him and his ministers. This political straitjacket will narrow the range of governmental action to bring welfare to the precarious majority. Government inaction would in turn increase popular discontent, eroding the legitimacy of social democratic forces in Brazil and preparing the ground for a stronger Bolsonarista comeback.\n The far right is also resurging in Italy, the EU’s third-biggest economy.\n For the past year and a half, Italy has been administered by a technocratic “national unity” government, which briefly brought together left-populist, center and far-right parties, and was led by Mario Draghi, the former governor of the European Central Bank. Giorgia Meloni’s party, Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy), which she co-founded in 2012 and that controlled just 4 percent of Parliament, was the only one in opposition. This hardline, uncompromising stance against the pro-EU technocratic government yielded fruits after the Draghi government collapsed in July. In the recent snap election, Meloni campaigned with the slogan “Italy and Italians first!” and her coalition, which includes the far-right Lega Nord as well as Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party Forza Italia, achieved 44 percent of the vote. Brothers of Italy was the most voted party in Parliament with 26 percent, which paved the way for Meloni to become the first female prime minister of Italy.\n \n Brothers of Italy is the successor of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), which was active but marginal until 1995. In addition to occupying the same headquarters as MSI in Rome and using its central symbol, the tricolor flame, Brothers of Italy follow closely the 1926 fascist doctrine to protect the “State, family, morality and the economy.” Meloni, a Christian nationalist who praised Mussolini when she was younger, has promised to “defend God, country, and family.” Her rhetoric comes straight from the far-right playbook. She has proposed a naval blockade against migrants (a measure that was declared a violation of human rights by the European Court of Human Rights in 2012), to “protect human life from conception” (abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978 and has been reaffirmed in two national referendums) and to cut taxes. In a speech in a meeting with the Spanish far-right party Vox in June, she laid out the principles of her neo-fascist ideology: “yes to the natural family … no to gender ideology … yes to the universality of the Cross … no to mass immigration, yes to jobs for our citizens, no to international finance.”\n Meloni’s victory is partially due to anti-establishment sentiments after the failure of successive governments to improve living conditions, as well as to the spreading of fake news that appealed to people’s fear of “the other.” On the campaign trail, immigration was a hot topic and voters were bombarded with xenophobic posts and manipulated content.

Kathy Hochul and spreading his tough-on-crime message.\n Polls have suggested the messaging is working as the numbers have tightened — the Hochul campaign has pivoted to focus on crime and the economy, and Democrats have launched a frantic effort to boost the Hochul campaign they’d previously considered rock solid.\n Jacobs suggested that the Zeldin campaign’s actions could be setting up to challenge any unfavorable results on Election Day.\n “There's a lot of shenanigans going on,” Jacobs said. “And it seems like they are setting up the scenario or the narrative for the future that there's something awry.”\n Zeldin campaign spokesperson Katie Vincentz said the investigation is a “desperate attempt\" from the Hochul campaign.\n “It’s absolutely zero coincidence that the person pushing this agenda at the Board of Elections is a political appointee of the Cuomo-Hochul administration,” she said of Johnson. “The Democratic Party is embarrassing itself with baseless tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.”\n Bill Mahoney contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Anna Gronewold","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/07/18/d2d72af64b1583616a0495a33dba/ap22299032855976.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Mary Altaffer/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Rep.

The move could complicate final passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act in the Senate as Democrats try to avoid a repeat of last year, when the legislation stalled on the floor.\n Republicans on Capitol Hill claimed the administration was politicizing the military by wading into the abortion debate with weeks to go before an election and siphoning money from top national security needs. Now, some GOP lawmakers want to use the Pentagon policy bill to block the post-Roe v. Wade initiative. \n \n \n Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall called it an “outrageous memorandum” and demanded Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to block the policy.\n “With all of the challenges we face globally, DoD needs to make our national security their top priority,” Marshall said in a statement. \n The top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, criticized the policy last week, demanding answers on the origin of Austin’s memo. He also hinted at a legislative push to stymie the policy.\n “Taxpayer dollars meant for deterring China and other adversaries should not be squandered on campaign politics,” Rogers said. “DoD must be blocked from wasting any portion of their budget on this horrendous policy.”\n Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, piled on, adding, “Partisan policies like this are what I have fought to leave out of the defense bill in the past.”\n Defense legislation that passed the House in July, just weeks after the Dobbs v.

So who are they, and is there any sign about which way they could tilt in the final week of the campaign?</p> <p>The news isn't good for Democrats, according to the poll, which was conducted Oct. 21-23. Undecided voters overwhelmingly believe the country is off on the wrong track: 83 percent of those undecided on the generic ballot say so.

(The poll was conducted prior to the attack on Pelosi's husband in their San Francisco home on Friday.)</p> <p>That doesn't mean all the undecideds are going to vote for Republican candidates. In fact, many of them probably won't vote at all: A full quarter of undecideds, 25 percent, say they're \"not at all enthusiastic\" about voting in the midterms, compared to just 6 percent of all registered voters in the POLITICO/Morning Consult survey. Only 8 percent say they're \"extremely enthusiastic\" about their midterm ballot, compared to 38 percent of voters supporting the Democratic candidate and 40 percent backing the Republican.</p> <p>But that, in and of itself, might be a problem for Democrats, since some of the key demographic groups they need to win are more likely to be undecided. Nearly a quarter of \"Generation Z\" voters — those born in 1997 or later — are undecided.

Both showed few voters are left undecided in the sharply polarized state.<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"After months of campaigning and billions in TV advertising, it might be hard to believe that there are still voters up for grabs in the midterms.\n But undecided voters are out there — and they're poised to be decisive in the fight to control the Senate next year, in addition to swinging key House and governor's races.\n In the latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, 11 percent of voters nationwide said they were undecided about which party's candidate to support for Congress. So who are they, and is there any sign about which way they could tilt in the final week of the campaign?\n The news isn't good for Democrats, according to the poll, which was conducted Oct. 21-23. Undecided voters overwhelmingly believe the country is off on the wrong track: 83 percent of those undecided on the generic ballot say so. Sixty-two percent of generic-ballot undecideds disapprove of the job Joe Biden is doing as president, and 60 percent have an unfavorable opinion of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (The poll was conducted prior to the attack on Pelosi's husband in their San Francisco home on Friday.)\n That doesn't mean all the undecideds are going to vote for Republican candidates. In fact, many of them probably won't vote at all: A full quarter of undecideds, 25 percent, say they're \"not at all enthusiastic\" about voting in the midterms, compared to just 6 percent of all registered voters in the POLITICO/Morning Consult survey. Only 8 percent say they're \"extremely enthusiastic\" about their midterm ballot, compared to 38 percent of voters supporting the Democratic candidate and 40 percent backing the Republican.\n But that, in and of itself, might be a problem for Democrats, since some of the key demographic groups they need to win are more likely to be undecided. Nearly a quarter of \"Generation Z\" voters — those born in 1997 or later — are undecided. Hispanic (22 percent) and Black (15 percent) voters are more likely to be undecided on the generic ballot than white voters (10 percent).\n And now, our weekly update of the polling in the states that will decide the Senate majority:\n \n  \n 1.\n Arizona\n MARK KELLY (D) vs. Blake Masters (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up (Last week: Lean Democratic)\nRCP polling average: Kelly +1.5 (Last week: Kelly +2.5)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +2.4\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n Although Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly led by larger, more consistent margins a month or two ago, Republican Blake Masters has closed much of the gap.\n Dating back to the August primary, Masters has never led in any publicly disclosed poll. But a survey from the Democratic firm Data for Progress this week showed the two men knotted up at 47 percent apiece.\n In that survey, 4 percent of voters were undecided, and 3 percent supported the Libertarian candidate, Marc Victor.\n POLITICO's Election Forecast reclassified the race this week, changing its rating from \"Lean Democratic\" to \"Toss Up.\"\n 2.\n Colorado\n MICHAEL BENNET (D) vs. Joe O'Dea (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Bennet +7.5 (Last week: Bennet +7.7)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +13.5\n There were no new polls this week in Colorado, where older survey data suggested Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet had a lead over Republican Joe O'Dea.\n 3.\n Florida\n MARCO RUBIO (R) vs. Val Demings (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Rubio +7.4 (Last week: Rubio +5.7)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +1.5\nEventual margin: Trump +3.3\n Two polls this week staked GOP Sen. Marco Rubio to leads over Democratic Rep. Val Demings: Rubio led Demings by 7 points in a Data for Progress poll, and by 11 points in a University of North Florida survey.\n Only 3 percent of voters were undecided the University of North Florida poll, but that notably includes 18 percent of all voters under 25 years old, and 8 percent of Black voters.\n 4.\n Georgia\n RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D) vs. Herschel Walker (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Walker +1.6 (Last week: Warnock +2.4)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +0.8\nEventual margin: Biden +0.3\n Republican Herschel Walker has seized the lead in the RealClearPolitics average over Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, though the three most-recent polls in the average are from Republican or conservative-leaning firms (and that doesn't include an internal survey released by the National Republican Senatorial Committee).\n Still, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer acknowledged that the party is \"going downhill\" in Georgia, in a hot-mic moment with President Joe Biden on an airport tarmac in Syracuse, N.Y.\n Regardless of which candidate has the lead, the number to watch is 50 percent: The leader needs to capture of a majority of all votes cast to win — otherwise, Walker and Warnock will meet again in a December runoff.\n 5.\n Nevada\n CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D) vs. Adam Laxalt (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Laxalt +1.2 (Last week: Laxalt +1.2)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +5.2\nEventual margin: Biden +2.7\n The average in Nevada was unchanged this week, though a poll from the Republican-favoring Trafalgar Group gave Republican Adam Laxalt a 4-point lead, tying the biggest advantage Laxalt has posted in any public survey. (The other poll in which Laxalt led Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by that large a margin was an older Trafalgar poll.)\n 6.\n New Hampshire\n MAGGIE HASSAN (D) vs. Don Bolduc (R)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Democratic\nRCP polling average: Hassan +3.4 (Last week: Hassan +5.4)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: No average\nEventual margin: Biden +7\n We've seen some tightening in New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan's average lead over Republican Don Bolduc shrank 2 percentage points over the past week.\n And that average doesn't include a survey from the Republican-leaning firm co/efficient for an in-state conservative media outlet that showed a tied race, 45 percent to 45 percent.\n 7.\n North Carolina\n Ted Budd (R) vs. Cheri Beasley (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Budd +4.5 (Last week: Budd +2.8)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +1.5\nEventual margin: Trump +1.3\n A Marist College poll out this week showed GOP Rep. Ted Budd and Democrat Cheri Beasley tied among all registered voters — but Budd with a 4-point lead among those who say they will \"definitely\" vote next month.\n Undecideds accounted for 1-in-10 of the registered-voter sample, but only 5 percent of definite voters said they hadn't made up their minds yet.\n 8.\n Ohio\n J.D. Vance (R) vs. Tim Ryan (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Lean Republican\nRCP polling average: Vance +2.2 (Last week: Vance +2.3)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Trump +0.6\nEventual margin: Trump +8.2\n Ohio is one of only two of the core 10 states where the GOP candidate didn't increase his lead over the past week (yes, all 10 Republican nominees are men).\n That's mostly driven by two public polls out on Monday, one from Marist College and the other from Siena College for Spectrum News, showing a tied race.\n Meanwhile, the Republican firm Cygnal continues to show GOP nominee J.D. Vance leading Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan in its tracking poll, with the latest version staking Vance to a 5-point lead.\n \n  \n 9.\n Pennsylvania\n Mehmet Oz (R) vs, John Fetterman (D)\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Fetterman +0.3 (Last week: Fetterman +2.4)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +5.3\nEventual margin: Biden +1.2\n We're still waiting for more data following Tuesday night's big debate between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz. The only survey to qualify for the RealClearPolitics average was a one-day poll from the GOP firm InsiderAdvantage, showing Oz narrowly ahead. But polls conducted in a single day are generally less reliable because they only capture the easiest-to-reach respondents.\n 10.\n Wisconsin\n RON JOHNSON (R) vs. Mandela Barnes\nPOLITICO Election Forecast rating: Toss Up\nRCP polling average: Johnson +3.3 (Last week: Johnson +2.8)\n2020 RCP polling average 10 days before the election: Biden +5.4\nEventual margin: Biden +0.7\n Two new polls this week had the same leader — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson — but portrayed slightly different pictures of the race's competitiveness. A Data for Progress poll showed Johnson leading Democrat Mandela Barnes by 5 points, 51 percent to 46 percent.\n But a CNN poll also out this week showed Johnson ahead by a single point, 50 percent to 49 percent. Both showed few voters are left undecided in the sharply polarized state.","dc:creator":"Steven Shepard","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/27/f8/a2a2055c4b4b900a2c362fd8b717/shepard-polling-undecided.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/Photo by Richmond Times-Dispatch","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/27/f8/a2a2055c4b4b900a2c362fd8b717/shepard-polling-undecided.jpg"}}]},"content":"Our latest weekly polling tracker shows Republicans making gains in the final days of the campaign.","contentSnippet":"Our latest weekly polling tracker shows Republicans making gains in the final days of the campaign.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/29/undecided-voters-midterms-polls-2022-00063971","isoDate":"2022-10-29T11:00:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Sarah Ferris, Nicholas Wu and Kelly Hooper","title":"Paul Pelosi told attacker he needed to use the bathroom, called 911 from there","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/28/nancy-pelosi-husband-assaulted-00063965","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 08:01:45 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314532788112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>The violent home invasion at Speaker <a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51564\" data-person-id=\"51564\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666988578794,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-20e1-da54-a9ff-f0f369670000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666988578794,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-20e1-da54-a9ff-f0f369670000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\\&quot;identifier\\&quot;:\\&quot;51564\\&quot;,\\&quot;url\\&quot;:\\&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51564\\&quot;,\\&quot;preferredName\\&quot;:\\&quot;Rep.

He will be booked at San Francisco County jail on charges of attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and several additional felonies.</p> <p>Special agents from the Capitol Police department's California field office \"quickly arrived on scene,\" and a team from the department's Threat Assessment Section was dispatched to the West Coast to assist with the joint investigation, Capitol Police said.</p> <p>Support for the speaker and Paul Pelosi streamed in from both sides of the aisle.

White and Olivia Beavers contributed to this report.</i></p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"The violent home invasion at Speaker Nancy Pelosi's residence Friday morning — which led to an attack that left her husband Paul hospitalized — is rattling Washington at a time when fears of political violence were already spiking.\n The break-in is a dramatic escalation of the kind of aggressive threats that many lawmakers in both parties have seen in recent years, particularly since last year's brutal Capitol siege. For some in the Hill community, the revelation that the perpetrator called out “where's Nancy?” during the invasion eerily echoed the chants of pro-Trump Jan. 6 rioters, who stormed the Capitol and searched the halls for the speaker in a bid to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.\n Pelosi, who was away from her San Francisco home at the time of the attack, has long warned of rising violent rhetoric and made security for Congress' members and staff a higher priority since the riot — which included the pilfering of her own office.\n Law enforcement officials are still investigating how the alleged assailant, identified by police as 42-year-old David DePape, was able to access the speaker’s home and have not yet assessed a motive. \n Paul Pelosi was able to dial 911 himself after telling the intruder he had to go use the bathroom and then calling from there, where his phone had been charging, according to a person familiar with the situation. He was hospitalized after the attack at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, where he successfully underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and “serious injuries to right arm and hands,” Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill said in a statement Friday evening.\n The speaker's husband is expected to make a full recovery.\n “The Speaker and her family are thankful for the outpouring of support and prayers from friends, constituents and people around the country,” Hammill added. \"The Pelosi family is immensely grateful to Mr. Pelosi’s entire medical team and the law enforcement officers who responded to the assault. The family appreciates respect for their privacy during this time.”\n The incident is renewing a fierce debate in Washington and beyond about how to protect members of Congress and their families.\n “Everyone is shaken. It’s absolutely chilling,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of many Democrats who reached out to the speaker’s team upon hearing the news. “You can be against me for what I stand for. But the vitriol to the point of spurring violence is so unacceptable.”\n Dean, who's received violent threats against her and her family, now carries a bulletproof vest in her car after her involvement in Trump’s first impeachment trial. “Who thought I was going to walk into service and need one of those?” she asked.\n Congress has doled out millions of dollars since Jan. 6 for protection of lawmakers and their families, including expanding access to home security cameras, body armor and private security guards, on top of a separate effort to protect Supreme Court justices' families. But several lawmakers, predominantly Democrats, have said there’s more to be done. Earlier this year, U.S. Capitol Police reported about 9,600 threats against lawmakers in 2021 — a steady increase from previous years.\n The invasion at the Pelosi residence swiftly drew condemnation from top Republicans, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) — himself a survivor of a politically motivated attack, who said he was \"disgusted\" by the assault on the speaker's husband. Scalise personally phoned Pelosi after hearing of the incident, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also reached out.\n The swiftness of public GOP support for the speaker, ranging from McCarthy to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), struck a rare note of bipartisan collegiality at the end of a midterm election dominated by bitter sniping across the aisle. It was especially notable as Pelosi remains a favorite political villain for GOP campaigns.\n \n  \n On the same day as the Pelosi attack, a Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.). the assailant had repeatedly dialed the congressman’s office to say he “had a lot of AR-15s” and wanted to shoot the member. And just months earlier, in July, a man was charged with felony stalking after making threats outside of the home of Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) while carrying a holstered firearm. \n And it’s not just members of Congress: In June, a man with a gun and knife was arrested outside of the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after making threats against him.\n The Capitol Police, which are part of the investigation along with the FBI and San Francisco police, have obtained video from the attack showing the alleged assailant, DePape, breaking into Pelosi's house with a hammer, according to sources familiar with the situation. DePape entered the Pelosi house early Friday morning while searching for the speaker and shouting “where is Nancy, where is Nancy?”, according to a source briefed on the attack.\n Later Friday morning, the block of stately homes where Pelosi lives was cordoned off with police tape. Several police vehicles and FBI agents were visible outside the residence.\n In a brief press conference Friday, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said that police officers were dispatched to the Pelosi residence at about 2:30 a.m. for a “priority well-being check,” and arrived on the scene to find Paul Pelosi and DePape holding a hammer.\n “The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it,” Scott said. “Our officers immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him, took him into custody, requested emergency backup and rendered medical aid.”\n DePape, the suspect, was also transported to a local hospital for treatment, Scott said. He will be booked at San Francisco County jail on charges of attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and several additional felonies.\n Special agents from the Capitol Police department's California field office \"quickly arrived on scene,\" and a team from the department's Threat Assessment Section was dispatched to the West Coast to assist with the joint investigation, Capitol Police said.\n Support for the speaker and Paul Pelosi streamed in from both sides of the aisle. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement Friday the assault on Paul Pelosi is \"another example of the dangerous consequences of the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is putting lives at risk and undermining our very democracy and Democratic institutions.\"\n Biden, speaking at a Friday evening fundraiser in Pennsylvania, called the attack \"despicable\" and implored Americans to \"stand up clearly and unambiguously\" against political violence.\n White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a earlier statement that Biden called Nancy Pelosi Friday morning to \"express his support after this horrible attack\" and to condemn the violence. She added that the president is praying for the Pelosi family and that he's \"very glad\" a full recovery is expected.\n Many lawmakers, including McConnell and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, took to Twitter Friday morning to condemn the attack and express support for the speaker and her husband.\n House Republican Caucus Chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said of the alleged attacker in a statement \"this criminal should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n \"Horrified and disgusted by the reports that Paul Pelosi was assaulted in his and Speaker Pelosi's home last night,\"McConnell said in a tweet. \"Grateful to hear that Paul is on track to make a full recovery and that law enforcement including our stellar Capitol Police are on the case.\"\n However, not every Republican offered unabashed support. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, while campaigning with GOP congressional candidate Yesli Vega, told an audience of Paul and Nancy Pelosi: “There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re going to send her back to be with him in California.”\n And not every Democrat was satisfied with the warm words after Friday's traumatic attack.\n \"We know what has fueled this: It is years of vitriol and disinformation,\" Dean said, citing GOP leaders who have allowed politically motivated lies, including those about the validity of elections, to become mainstream. \"What we have sown is what we are reaping.\"\n Jeremy B.

Circuit Court of Appeals judges — Karen Henderson, Robert Wilkins and Florence Pan — turned down the emergency stay request at about 7 p.m. on the evening before Short testified, according to a court docket POLITICO reviewed that reflects the closed-door legal battle.\n \n \n Trump’s team could have sought relief from the Supreme Court following that rejection, but such an application has yet to be filed in the dispute.\n The appeals court panel’s ruling was the result of a four-month fight that was initiated on June 10 over testimony related to grand jury subpoenas pertaining to the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. That fight began around the same time Short first appeared before federal investigators. But it accelerated rapidly on Sept. 28, when Howell ruled against Trump. The nature of the ruling remains sealed but it pertained to two grand jury subpoenas that Trump had challenged.\n The identity of the recipients of those subpoenas is not clear, though the timing suggests they were connected to testimony from Short and Greg Jacob, Pence’s chief counsel.\n POLITICO moved to unseal\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.248620/gov.uscourts.dcd.248620.1.0.pdf\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71ba0000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71ba0001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">moved to unseal Howell’s Sept. 28 ruling and related filings last week.

Having made Trump synonymous with lying, deceiving and bigotry, that job has been largely accomplished. But the political landscape can’t be remade by mere denormalizing. The most horrifying thing about Trump’s constant lies is not that he convinces his supporters to accept them but that his supporters don’t care that much about whether he’s telling the truth as they do about his positions or affectations about the culture war, race, immigration, abortion, grievance, police, trade, guns and political elites. Trump knows that when he stretches the facts, the press will call him out on it. But he also knows that his supporters will perceive his falsehoods as symbolic truths and cheer. The press should continue its lie-spotting because it’s our mission, but critics like Sullivan are wrong to expect such vigilance to change every mind.</p> <p>Sullivan correctly urges reporters to increase its coverage of “election deniers” who dishonestly preach about a “stolen” 2020 election. But that’s just sending a telegram the press got long ago.

She would prefer more “thoughtful framing and context” in coverage. Who can oppose that? Likewise, she counsels better quality control of headlines and news alerts to prevent the further dissemination of lies. Count me in. But her notions that the press should pay less attention to polls and staff blow-ups don’t reflect the way politics are waged. Polls drive fundraising and endorsements, both of which are key to winning votes which is the point of an election. To ignore them would be like ignoring the overture to a symphony. And a candidate’s ability to assemble a solid staff is a good stand-in for how they’ll perform in office.

Report on the party that has come to embody him. Talk with the people who vote for him. Explore the conditions of their lives. Dig into the issues that move them. Trace the lies that beguile them.” But isn’t that precisely what the press pack has been doing since Trump reentered campaigning?</p> <p>Packer adds a useful coverage suggestion in his kicker, writing that “when Trump says nothing new, ignore him.” But there’s evidence that the press is already doing so.

We were too soft on him in 2016, goes the drift. We handed a liar a megaphone and neglected to turn it off. We delighted in covering him because he delivered clicks. We failed to communicate how aberrant he was, thereby normalizing him. We let him blow through democratic norms.\n Such sentiments, expressed in full-throat by former Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan, but also echoed in part by pundit Bill Press, veteran journalist Marvin Kalb, journalist George Packer, and others, predictably comes paired with the advice that the “media” must radically rethink his coverage should he run again in 2024 as expected. The stories should highlight Trump’s mendacious, anti-democratic ways, and never amplify his lies. If we don’t reform our ways and he wins, we will be charged as accessories to democracy’s murder. Or something akin to that.\n But the notion that press “blunders” contributed to Trump’s victory — and that these blunders will elect him again unless the press corps corrects its ways — completely misreads 2016’s coverage. As I’ve written before, from the birth of his candidacy through Election Day, the press rode Trump like a donkey. In the opening weeks of his campaign, it reported and criticized Trump’s racist talk about Mexicans, recounted his status as a liar, billboarded his denigration of John McCain, corrected him when he blamed 9/11 on George W. Bush, charted his sleazy business practices, spelled out his policy ignorance, listed his flip-flops and recorded his misogynistic ways. No presidential candidate in memory outside of George Wallace received harsher coverage. If anything, the press denormalized Trump, rising to declare in unison in the summer of 2015 that the Trump campaign was not just grotesque but also toast.\n Despite this coruscating coverage, Trump polled at 30 percent going into the second Republican debate in mid-September 2015, an astonishing feat for a political newcomer in a field of 16. As the campaign progressed, the press poured more of the same on Trump — all deserved, mind you — uncovering his devious use of philanthropy, exposing his lies in fact-checking columns and shaming him for his Muslim-ban plan. Trump did find safe harbor at Fox News Channel and on Morning Joe, and the cable networks covered his rallies with real frequency. But the coverage reflected his status as the front-runner. By the time Trump had secured the nomination, he still commanded the airwaves over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But whose fault was that? Trump made himself available while Clinton consciously backed out of the TV spotlight, as the New York Times reported in a May 30, 2016 piece. Even so, the news about Trump was largely negative. The conservatives at the National Review published a special “Against Trump” issue in January 2016, and the Weekly Standard’s neocons took a similar anti-Trump slant. A full spectrum of the press warned us about who he was.\n \n \n Once Trump became president, his behavior didn’t change, nor did the critical coverage end. To those who say the press failed to properly call out Trump for his many lies, please consult the news clips. The press did refrain from calling Trump a liar for the first two years of his administration, but by June 2019 the press had overcome that reluctance, as the Washington Post’s Paul Farhi reported. “It’s (almost) official: The president of the United States is a liar,” Farhi wrote. “Nowadays, many in the news media are no longer bothering to grant Trump the benefit of the doubt. In routine news and feature stories, Trump’s dishonesty carries no fig leaf. It is described baldly.”\n Should the press have started calling Trump a liar earlier? Perhaps. I had no problem doing so in December 2015. But I wasn’t alone. The fact-checkers at FactCheck.org crowned Trump “The King of Whoppers’ the same month. PolitiFact awarded him “Lie of the Year” in 2015, 2017, and 2019. It’s worth mentioning that Trump’s capacity for lies increased as he settled into the White House, as the New Yorker’s Susan B. Glasser reported in August 2018: Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler logged 2,140 false claims by President Trump in his first year but twice as many (4,229) in the six months of 2018 leading up to Glasser’s piece. By 2018’s end, Trump had become recognized as such a profligate liar that Kessler had to devise a new unit of measurement to describe Trump’s insistence on repeated single falsehoods again and again. To the previous measure of lies on a one-to-four Pinocchio scale, Kessler instituted The Bottomless Pinocchio.\n Some critics insist that the press do more to denormalize candidates like Trump. Having made Trump synonymous with lying, deceiving and bigotry, that job has been largely accomplished. But the political landscape can’t be remade by mere denormalizing. The most horrifying thing about Trump’s constant lies is not that he convinces his supporters to accept them but that his supporters don’t care that much about whether he’s telling the truth as they do about his positions or affectations about the culture war, race, immigration, abortion, grievance, police, trade, guns and political elites. Trump knows that when he stretches the facts, the press will call him out on it. But he also knows that his supporters will perceive his falsehoods as symbolic truths and cheer. The press should continue its lie-spotting because it’s our mission, but critics like Sullivan are wrong to expect such vigilance to change every mind.\n Sullivan correctly urges reporters to increase its coverage of “election deniers” who dishonestly preach about a “stolen” 2020 election. But that’s just sending a telegram the press got long ago.

The same with the Washington Post. And the Los Angles Times. And the Wall Street Journal. It’s a great prescription but the patient has already taken the medicine.\n \n \n She makes other suggestions worthy of our consideration for how to cover a Trump 2024 bid. She would prefer more “thoughtful framing and context” in coverage. Who can oppose that? Likewise, she counsels better quality control of headlines and news alerts to prevent the further dissemination of lies. Count me in. But her notions that the press should pay less attention to polls and staff blow-ups don’t reflect the way politics are waged. Polls drive fundraising and endorsements, both of which are key to winning votes which is the point of an election. To ignore them would be like ignoring the overture to a symphony. And a candidate’s ability to assemble a solid staff is a good stand-in for how they’ll perform in office. The backstabbing that occurred in the Trump campaign only grew fiercer when he arrived in the White House. It’s not mere gossip.\n One critic of Trump coverage, the Atlantic’s George Packer, offers this suggestion for the media in 2024. “If Trump runs again, journalists would do better to follow the money that supports him. Report on the party that has come to embody him. Talk with the people who vote for him. Explore the conditions of their lives. Dig into the issues that move them. Trace the lies that beguile them.” But isn’t that precisely what the press pack has been doing since Trump reentered campaigning?\n Packer adds a useful coverage suggestion in his kicker, writing that “when Trump says nothing new, ignore him.” But there’s evidence that the press is already doing so. His spurious Truth Social posts don’t get picked up the way his tweets once did, but then again, he’s not president now. Even New York University press scholar Jay Rosen, who loudly disdains the conventions of political reporting concedes that covering somebody like Trump is “not as simple as ‘don’t amplify.’” He continues, “There are occasions when the public needs to know that a political figure is falsifying reality, or that a consequential lie is gaining traction, as with Stop the Steal.”\n None of this is to belittle those who implore the press to improve its game in 2024. As ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl put it succinctly last year, Trump presents unique challenges. “You’re covering essentially an anti-democratic candidate,” Karl said on Reliable Sources. “You’re covering somebody running in a system that is trying to undermine that very system.” But again, is there a newsroom in America that hasn’t internalized that lesson by now?\n \n \n Reporters and editors should never reflexively bat away criticism. If Trump runs again in 2024, which looks likely, they’ll need as many back-seat drivers as they can get. But a genuine reckoning on how to cover Trump in 2024 must take an accurate inventory of the way we’ve actually covered him.\n ******\n Send your favorite Trump lie to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"mailto:shafer.politico@gmail.com\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70fa0000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70fa0001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

They won — so far so good — and they implemented the policy they had campaigned on. Almost immediately, the British economy was hammered with high interest rates and a plunge in the value of the pound. Truss’ poll numbers nosedived, and she quickly backed down. But this only made those who had voted for her wonder why they should still support her. She lost everyone’s confidence, and the end was clear.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314059018112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>What does this head-spinning series of events mean for American would-be tax cutters? Republican politicians ignore economists who argue against tax cuts, because it’s a policy that no one in the Republican coalition objects to.

Cutting taxes was also the signature domestic economic accomplishment of the Donald Trump presidency.</p> <p>At the same time, the British debacle comes at a time when the American right has been edging slowly away from free market orthodoxy. The GOP is embracing a more populist edge and is eager to be seen as a working-class party, criticizing trade and “woke” businesses.</p> <p>Does Truss’ fate show that big tax cuts, particularly for the rich, just aren’t a credible option anymore? Have the markets finally wised up to what economists have been saying? Would the next American politician proposing big tax cuts meet Truss’ fate?</p> <p>Truss cut taxes at a time when interest rates are edging higher, fueling worry among investors. When Trump cut taxes, interest rates were lower. On the other hand, interest rates were at similar levels under George W.

So even before Truss’ downfall, the tax cut zombie was already almost dead.</p> <p>But of course, that’s what the protagonists in the movie always think.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Behind the implosion of British Prime Minister Liz Truss lurks a question. If her insistence on huge tax cuts doomed her, does that mean the era of the tax cut zombie is finally coming to an end?\n For years now, it has been clear that there’s no strong evidence that tax cuts fuel economic growth. But Republican politicians in the United States kept trying it anyway — it was the idea that wouldn’t die. One economist even wrote a book on the matter called “Zombie Economics.”\n Liz Truss and her first Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, embraced the tax cut ideology and advertised it over the summer during the campaign for the leadership contest in the Tory Party. They won — so far so good — and they implemented the policy they had campaigned on. Almost immediately, the British economy was hammered with high interest rates and a plunge in the value of the pound. Truss’ poll numbers nosedived, and she quickly backed down. But this only made those who had voted for her wonder why they should still support her. She lost everyone’s confidence, and the end was clear.\n \n \n What does this head-spinning series of events mean for American would-be tax cutters? Republican politicians ignore economists who argue against tax cuts, because it’s a policy that no one in the Republican coalition objects to. Even low-income Republican voters who don’t stand to gain much from tax cuts like tax cuts, which helped make George W. Bush the president whose policies most closely matched what the American public, even the poor, wanted. Cutting taxes was also the signature domestic economic accomplishment of the Donald Trump presidency.\n At the same time, the British debacle comes at a time when the American right has been edging slowly away from free market orthodoxy. The GOP is embracing a more populist edge and is eager to be seen as a working-class party, criticizing trade and “woke” businesses.\n Does Truss’ fate show that big tax cuts, particularly for the rich, just aren’t a credible option anymore? Have the markets finally wised up to what economists have been saying? Would the next American politician proposing big tax cuts meet Truss’ fate?\n Truss cut taxes at a time when interest rates are edging higher, fueling worry among investors. When Trump cut taxes, interest rates were lower. On the other hand, interest rates were at similar levels under George W. Bush, and they were significantly higher when Ronald Reagan was cutting taxes, suggesting that something else is going on.\n The ways of financial markets are inscrutable, even to the people who constitute those markets, but there do seem to be big differences between Britain and the U.S. that suggest the United States may not face a similar crisis the next time its government proposes big tax cuts.\n One factor is that the U.K. — even under Margaret Thatcher — did not actually manage to cut taxes the way previous conservative U.S. presidents did. Thatcher is Truss’ idol. When she was 7 years old, Truss played Thatcher in her school’s mock election. During this summer’s campaign for the leadership, Truss adopted Thatcher’s blouses with bow ties and repeatedly proclaimed her Thatcherite credentials.\n But when Thatcher took office in 1979, taxes in the U.K. were about 30 percent of GDP, and when she left office in 1992 they were about 30 percent of GDP; Thatcher had actually raised taxes considerably in her first term, only bringing them back down later. In fact, the argument that tax cuts would automatically bring economic growth had not gained much credibility in the U.K. at the time, as Thatcher’s Chancellor Geoffrey Howe later noted: “My Treasury team and I had never succumbed — never seriously anyway — to the mistaken interpretations of Lafferism, which have led some U.S. policymakers so far astray.” Supply-side economics was never a big part of Thatcher’s economic policies, which were about privatization and council house sales instead.

But it is.</p> <p>One clue is in plain sight as you look around during the boring few minutes it takes to top off your tank. Plopped in the corner of the lot like an afterthought are four vertical red slabs.</p> <p>They’re electric vehicle charging stations, capable of reviving an EV and its battery in about half an hour. It is no exaggeration to say they could be the most disruptive thing ever to confront that century-old fixture of the American roadside: the gas station. As more Americans<b> </b>drive their shiny new electric vehicles onto the highway and wonder where to go when the battery nears empty, charging stations are the agents of a revolutionary fill-up — not of gallons but kilowatts, not five-minute “stops” but half-hour “experiences” that could completely transform the tenor of the road trip.</p> <p>These pumps and plugs facing each other across the asphalt are also totems of an unseen battle. Two titans of the energy sector — electric companies and gas stations — have peacefully coexisted for a century but now find themselves vying for the right to serve electric vehicle owners. In just the last nine months, automakers have sold over 576,000 EVs, a 70-percent jump over the same period last year, according to auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. A burst of investment in both vehicles and chargers<b> </b>from automakers and the feds suggest that’s just the beginning. Ford and General Motors, America’s two biggest automakers, and the Biden administration have coalesced around a goal of electrifying half of new cars by 2030.</p> <p>Crucial to that future is a nationwide network of charging stations. Who controls those stations and the fuel coursing through them is the flash point of a fight between the electric utility and the convenience store. The outcome will impact where Americans charge their EVs and how much they pay.</p> <p>As both gas stations and power companies hang their future on the electric vehicle, the fight has gotten ugly. In fact, heads have already rolled. One electric utility, Southern California Edison, forced the resignation of a key lobbyist in order to kneecap the gas station industry as Congress considered President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging stations. The spigot of federal dollars only increased with the passage in August of the big federal climate-energy bill, stuffed with incentives to restructure the auto industry around EVs.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4d/4d/0c1d8d314dc3b86f529368c6f61e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.biden.jpg\"> <br> <p>This collision between electricity and gasoline is in sharp relief at Kum &amp; Go, a chain of almost 400 filling stations and convenience marts in 11 states that has invited the electric vehicle to disrupt its business model. Wellington is the final settlement of metro Denver before the plains spread north toward Wyoming. Alongside the grind of I-25, next to a McDonald's, stands the Kum &amp; Go with its sign advertising the latest price for unleaded. It’s one of six Kum &amp; Go stations in the state that have embraced electric vehicle charging. Other gas station chains sometimes host charging stations owned by someone else, often Tesla. But Kum &amp; Go has branded these stations in its red-and-white color scheme.</p> <p>In 2018, Kum &amp; Go set the goal of “being known as the place that has EV charging,” said Jacob Maass, the company’s commercial fuel manager. This year, as electric vehicles have begun to seem inevitable and the Biden administration spends big to construct a network of 500,000 fast-charging stations, some of the country’s biggest fueling chains have joined the parade, including Pilot Co. and 7-Eleven.</p> <p>But success hinges on resolving fundamental disputes over who has the right to sell electricity, and for how much.</p> <p>The supply chain that underpins the gas station — starting in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia or Texas and flowing through intermediaries to that big price on the sign — becomes something else entirely in the EV age. What replaces it is a system of stupefying complexity. The price a station host pays for the new fuel is determined by which of America’s 3,000 electric utilities the plugs happen to be connected to. This pricing system is invisible to the driver but presents an existential dilemma for gas station owners. They find themselves at the mercy of an opaque, highly regulated and monopolistic electricity system that is the exact opposite of the one they have thrived on for decades. </p> <p>EV charging involves “an electricity market structure that was not designed for — and is, not surprisingly, incompatible with — the retail fuel market,” said A.J. Siccardi, a fueling executive, in testimony to Congress last summer that caused sparks between the two camps.</p> <p>It is possible that gas stations and electric companies will sort through their thicket of disagreements so that gas stations can make money filling batteries, while also (strangely enough) becoming a cool place to hang out. Or it’s possible that the fueling station as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by battery refills in home garages, at workplace parking lots or at Starbucks, while the driver nurses a venti latte.</p> <p>In other words, these electric cubes on the Colorado roadside are either the dominoes that trigger the gas station’s revolution, or the headstones that mark its grave.<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">A</span>merica’s 20th-century economic growth was powered by the electric grid and the gas station. But as businesses, they couldn’t be more different.</p> <p>The gas station arrived in the early 1900s, soon after the car itself, and quickly became a cutthroat game. Because the fuels they sold were nearly identical, sellers could differentiate themselves only by lowering prices. The only way to survive on those rock-bottom prices was to sell more gas. These imperatives drew fuelers to high-traffic intersections, where they broadcasted their prices from huge billboards. Today, America’s 120,000 gas stations are one of the most transparent, hyper-competitive markets in America.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fa/59/7a977f2f40eaa4d75bc83bedc14e/ev-photogrid-v2.jpg\"> <br> <p>Unlike gasoline, electricity was not a street-corner hustle. People wanted it everywhere. Competing for business didn’t make sense because the wiring was so expensive. The grid wasn’t a business, really, but an essential public service — a utility. A social compact emerged where the electric utility would bear the cost of building and maintaining the grid, and in exchange would enjoy a territorial monopoly. To prevent abuse, each state created a public utility commission to oversee the utility’s complicated pricing schedules. The electric company became one of the most complex, obscure and uncompetitive markets in America. </p> <p>And then came the electric vehicle.</p> <p>It short-circuited what had been a symbiotic relationship. After all, gas stations and power companies are each other’s customers. The station illuminates its sign with electricity, and the utility fills its repair trucks with gasoline. Financially, the two are now nearly at parity: The convenience-store industry made $428 billion last year selling fuel, while corporate utilities earned $424 billion selling electricity. But the electric vehicle will inexorably tilt the playing field in the utility’s favor. That’s because with the onset of the EV, the dominant fuel will become electricity — and the utility controls it all.</p> <p>The utility monopoly is so basic to modern life that it goes unnoticed. But it explains why there’s never a usage fee for plugging in your laptop at the coffee shop, or for running the hotel hairdryer until your hairdo is crisp. Charging for electricity is illegal unless you’re the electric company.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2b/39/c8548060429bbbda79a181b7fa9e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.electrichx.jpg\"> <br> <p>As electric vehicles started taking hold, it occurred to many entrepreneurs that fueling them could be a moneymaker. But they faced an odd financial barrier. The fueler pays the utility for the electricity, but can’t ask the driver to share the cost. So, companies found workarounds. Some providers charged for the time spent plugged in. Others assessed a session fee. (Until two years ago, Tesla Inc., the EV market leader, let many of its drivers refuel at its Supercharger stations for free.) No strategy reflected the actual cost, but they were a start. Business needed a change to the law — an exemption that would, for the first time, allow someone other than a power company to sell electricity.</p> <p>Delia Meier, a senior vice president at Iowa 80, a chain of truck stops, took a leading position in Iowa to open the market to ‘charge for charging,’ as it’s sometimes called. “There’s a lot of red tape, a lot of things that probably don’t make any sense,” she said. The Iowa Utilities Board rarely met and moved slow. Meier’s regional utility, Alliant Energy, would request additional hearings, and submit objections at the last minute. To Meier, it seemed the utility was conducting a passive, faceless resistance, using its unmatched savvy before the utility board to wear down any who would challenge its monopoly status.</p> <p>“The whole time it seemed like people were agreeing with us,” Meier said. “Then (the board) would have a hearing and decide not to do anything about it. It went on and on and on.”</p> <p>In a statement to POLITICO’s E&amp;E News, Alliant said, “We are excited to be on the leading edge of electrification efforts and work hard to understand and meet our customers’ needs.”<br></p> <br> <p>In 2019, after a three-year process, Iowa relaxed its rules so stations like Iowa 80 can charge its customers any price for electric fuel, just like gasoline. Most states have done the same. The main lobbyists who forced the issue weren’t gas stations, but new companies whose bread and butter were charging stations — EVgo Inc., ChargePoint Holdings Inc. and, of course, Tesla. Alongside them were environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that a transition to electric vehicles — necessary to head off the climate crisis — couldn’t happen without a financial incentive to sell electric fuel to drivers. Today, only seven states still regulate EV charging as the exclusive domain of the electric company.</p> <p>But even with the freedom to charge customers what they want, gas station owners still think that the utility has stacked the deck against them.</p> <p>One reason is that some utilities also own and operate charging stations. They do so with their ratepayers’ money, in plans approved by regulators. Generally, this happens sparingly and in areas shunned by private industry. But convenience store owners fear the utility as a competitor because the utility has a state-allotted profit built into each of its investments. They worry this padding could lead the utility to set a new floor for fuel prices that the gas station can’t match.</p> <p>Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, explained it this way to Georgia lawmakers last year. Her 6,500 members “have to use the electricity from only one utility. If that same electricity provider is allowed to provide electric fueling stations …<b> </b>taking zero capital risk like the private sector will, they will create and maintain a monopoly in this market.”</p> <p>Gas station owners say their resistance to the electric company is not an effort to slow the transition away from their marquee product. “We have no more commitment to fossil fuels than we do to Snickers bars,” said Brian Young, the owner of a chain of gas stations in eastern Alabama. Rather, it’s that the prospect of installing a charging station is intimidatingly expensive.</p> <p>Convenience stores make tiny profits on gasoline and diesel. “Whether we sell at one dollar or four dollars,” Young said, “we still make 14 cents.” In this low-margin world, a fast charger is a monster investment. The hardware can cost $150,000 or more, according to a 2019 study by think tank RMI. It is a bracing risk, especially since no one knows exactly where future EV drivers will want to fuel. </p> <p>“Honestly, I’m dreading it, but maybe there’s a silver lining,” said Bob Bajwa, the owner of a gas station in Ritzville, Wash., on the prospect of transitioning to EVs. He’s being somewhat optimistic given his personal experience. Bajwa already has one charging station — installed on his property in 2015 by charging provider EVgo — that gets only the occasional customer and produces almost no revenue.</p> <p>The convenience stores know they are overmatched. It’s hard to imagine a future without an electric grid, but one without gas stations can be pretty easily conjured. The fuelers can’t unseat the utility as the kingpin. But a crucial question remains: What will the fuel cost?<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">O</span>ut of sight, utilities and EV station hosts are locked in a furious pricing battle. It threatens to create an uneven charging network where stations are eagerly built in some areas and shunned in others.</p> <p>It comes down to an obscure set of maps. They demarcate the lines between utility service territories. Kum &amp; Go’s decision to put its charging station in Wellington was not an accident. It has a lot to do with the fact that Wellington sits in the territory of Xcel Energy Inc., the state’s largest utility. The consequences would be different if the station was built five blocks to the north, where the territory of a different utility, Poudre Valley REA, begins. The same is true six miles to the south, where power service transfers to yet another provider, the city of Fort Collins.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/a0/74213ce64fde93a5cb98eed8bdf9/mag.Ferris.EVStation.wellington.jpg\"> <br> <p>One reason Kum &amp; Go chose to put its station in Xcel’s territory, and not in Fort Collins or Poudre Valley, is the electricity bill. In particular, it comes down to one line item, a fee that homeowners know nothing about, but some businesses know only too well.</p> <p>It’s called a demand charge. It is a base fee that gets multiplied. The multiplier is the kilowatt, the basic measurement of electrons. The fee is assessed on the few minutes of the monthly billing cycle when the customer is using the most kilowatts. Power companies have always charged this kind of fee as a means to recover the substantial cost of providing service to the customers who need a lot of electrical infrastructure. But the rationale goes haywire when applied to electric vehicles.</p> <p>That’s because an electric vehicle fast charger sucks energy like a black hole.</p> <p>“The draw is incredible,” said Meier of the Iowa 80 truck stop. She installed a couple of fast chargers last year. This type, technically known as a direct-current fast charger, is the natural choice for fueling-on-the-go because it fills a battery in anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the charger and the car model, compared to the slower systems that EV owners put in the home garage that can take all night. If two electric cars arrive and plug in at the same time, the electricity flow becomes a flood. The two fast chargers at Meier’s truck stop can use as much juice in their peak moments<b> </b>as the center’s six restaurants, 56,000 square-foot store, gas pumps and back offices combined.</p> <p>This sudden slurp of electricity can vault a gas station from the power stature of, say, a warehouse into the tier of heavy-duty power users such as an aluminum factory or a large farm with lots of irrigation pumps. But there’s a crucial difference: The factory or farm can plan its electricity use to avoid the sting of high demand charges. The host of a charging station cannot. At some moment beyond the gas station’s control, a flock of EVs will descend simultaneously, and the bill goes stratospheric.</p> <p>Those demand charges become an enormous burden. Electrify America, a leading charging provider, says that demand charges are up to 80 percent of the cost of operating a charging station.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/79/137161aa4918a829b67e1892a12a/mag.Ferris.EVStation.installgrid.jpg\"> <br> <p>A look at these power companies’ rates reveals why Kum &amp; Go was motivated to put its EV chargers in Wellington. If four electric vehicles plug into Kum &amp; Go’s four chargers at the same moment, they require the utility to summon 250 kilowatts. In Wellington, in the realm of power company Xcel, that kilowattage yields a monthly demand charge of $750. If the station moved south to Fort Collins, the charge rises to $2,672. If Kum &amp; Go plugged in to the north, in Poudre Valley, it would rise to $4,750. That’s six times the cost in Wellington.</p> <p>Finding utility territories with lower demand charges has become “a checkpoint for us before we approve a site,” said Maass. As for the territories with higher demand charges, he said: “We’re trying to avoid it the best we can.”</p> <p>Heading north on I-25, a Denver driver glides across five utility territories without even noticing. But for the gas-station operator, they are a hazardous game of hopscotch. These random power fiefs are not just a Denver thing, either: Each of the country’s 3,000 electric utilities has its own demand-charge regime, none having a logical relationship to their neighbors.</p> <p>“Literally they can put it on the other side of the freeway and it will be much cheaper,” said John Phelan, an energy services manager of Fort Collins’ utility.</p> <p>Profit isn’t yet an option. With expensive equipment and few users, the convenience store’s best outcome is to break even. “We’re trying to cover the cost of the electricity bill,” said Meier of Iowa 80, “and I think that’s all that anyone can expect at this point.”</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go knows the pain of this math. Ken Kleemeier, its vice president of fuels, gives the example of a 150-kilowatt charging session with a $6 demand charge. Six dollars times 150 kilowatts means the electricity bill is $900. But “we charge the customer $10,” Kleemeier said.<b> </b>“That’s a $900 loss. That’s where the demand charges are painful. There’s no feasible way to pass that along.”</p> <p>The utilities believe the demand-charge burden is temporary. As electric vehicles become more common, a charging station’s “utilization rate” — the number of hours per day the station is in use — will increase. The demand charge will be absorbed by more and more users, and eventually turn the charging station from money pit into profit center.</p> <p>Furthermore, utilities are starting to offer “demand charge holidays.” These are a period of years where the utility voids or lowers the fee to ease the transition. Gas stations are skeptical. “When the holiday expires, you’re back to demand charges and you’re left with an investment you can’t make money off of,” said David Fialkov, head of government affairs at NATSO, a trade group for truck-stop operators.</p> <p>This multi-headed conflict has created lots of reasons for gas stations and utilities to confront each other. But no conflict has been as vicious as what happened in Washington, D.C., when billions of dollars were on the line.<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span>n the spring of 2021, as Congress was laying the foundations for President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, lobbyists for both utilities and convenience stores were working overtime, framing issues this way and not that, nudging lawmakers down policy paths that could become etched in law.</p> <p>Utilities wanted at least part of the billions of dollars that Congress was mulling for EV infrastructure to go toward their strong suit: installing new power lines and equipment to feed charging stations. They argued they were a crucial link to the EV future. The gas station lobby wanted money, too, to offset the expense of building charging stations. But even more than money, they wanted leverage. They saw an opportunity to have Congress put them, not utilities, at the center of EV fueling.</p> <p>And despite their relatively small size as a lobbying force, the gas stations were scoring some wins.</p> <p>“Our advocacy on all of those fronts, I think, began to get more attention,” said Doug Kantor. At the time, Kantor was a partner at the firm Steptoe, a leading law and lobbying firm with 300 lawyers in its Washington office. For years, Kantor had led a team at Steptoe that lobbied on behalf of several trade groups that represent gas stations and convenience stores.</p> <p>In May, an ally of Kantor’s secured a spot to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A.J. Siccardi, the president of Metroplex Energy, the parent company of RaceTrac, one of the country’s biggest fueling chains, laid out a detailed agenda that would, at every turn, benefit gas stations at the expense of utilities.</p> <p>Demand charges? Abolish them, Siccardi argued, and instead make electricity available at wholesale prices, like gasoline. Subsidies for charging stations? Bar utilities from getting them if they also tapped their ratepayers’ money. A “double dip,” he called it. He also called on Congress to force all states to make gas stations legal sellers of electricity.</p> <p>Despite its financial heft, no one from the utility industry was on the panel to refute him.</p> <p>But they quickly got wind of the proposals. Louis Finkel, the head of government relations at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said he was galled by the gas station lobby’s request to abolish demand charges, a pillar of how the utilities pay for expensive projects. “If someone said they have to rip out and move their fuel tanks a half a mile,” Finkel asked, “who would have to pay for it?”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/7b/9e/367284eb43059d6268193741216e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.pizarro.jpg\"> <br> <p>In June, Kantor and the gas station lobby scored another win. A group of 17 legislators sent a letter to the committee heads responsible for the EV-charging portions of the bill.

One person was particularly put out: Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the state’s biggest utilities. Correa, the letter’s author, said he received a heated call from Pizarro. “I think he didn’t like the tone of the letter,” Correa said in an interview, adding that he said he apologized to Pizarro.</p> <p>In a statement to POLITICO’s E&amp;E News, Southern California Edison said, “the company reached out to numerous lawmakers on provisions of the infrastructure bill,” adding that Pizarro “spoke with Congressman Correa on the important role that electric utilities, with the support and approval of state regulatory commissions, must play in ensuring the deployment of EV charging infrastructure.”</p> <p>But Edison didn’t stop there.</p> <p>In May, Kantor said, some of his partners at Steptoe reached out with uncomfortable news. It involved a request from Edison and other utility clients of Steptoe who weren’t named. Kantor said he was told that Edison had informed Steptoe that if it didn’t sever its relationship with the fueling industry, the electric utility would take its business elsewhere. Kantor described the utility’s thinking as: “Hey, strategically it would be a good thing if we sidelined Steptoe, so they couldn’t continue this advocacy,” he said. “And that was exactly what they did.” Edison declined to comment on Kantor’s story, calling it “an internal matter that is best addressed by Steptoe &amp; Johnson,” the firm’s former name.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/42/614bc9d64fd1b0ead723a74ee903/mag.Ferris.EVStation.traffic.jpg\"> <br> <p>No one forced Kantor to leave, but he thought it was the best thing. (“I did not think as an adviser to my clients that I should tell them they should continue to use me when one of the most important issues to the future of the industry was something that I couldn’t work on,” he said.)</p> <p>Those shoved out of Steptoe by the utilities now hold key positions in the gas-station industry. Kantor took a new job as general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a leading gas station trade group, while two people who left with him, Jessica Frend and LeeAnn Goheen, are in top policy jobs at NATSO. Steptoe declined to comment on the specifics of Kantor’s departure but said in a statement, “We continue to work with Doug in his role at NACS. We count him as a good personal friend as well as a former colleague.”</p> <p>In the end, despite its early tactical victories, the gas station lobby got little of what it wanted in the final infrastructure bill, which Biden signed in November. The bill did not overrule “charge for charging” regulations in individual states, nor block utilities from getting infrastructure funds. It asked state electricity regulators to consider the burden of demand charges, but that request has no teeth. By virtue of its incumbency and power, the utility industry had prevailed over the gas stations. It didn’t have to win; it just had to prevent change.</p> <p>“The c-stores and truck stops say sometimes that they’re uncomfortable” with the utilities’ regulated-monopoly model, said Phil Jones, a former utility regulator who heads a utility-heavy trade group, the Alliance for Transportation Electrification. “But we’ve told them that model is not going to change.”<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">T</span>he gas station of the future might not have a single pump or even a whiff of gasoline. That’s because it might not be a gas station, but a Walgreens.</p> <p>In February, the drugstore chain said it would install fast chargers at more than 500 locations. The hardware comes from Volta Inc., a station provider whose stations double as advertising kiosks, and that also owns the financial transaction between car and charger. In June, Volta signed up the grocer Kroger Co. at locations in Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. Chris Wendel, the co-founder of Volta, thinks electric vehicles shatter the gas station’s very premise.</p> <p>“People won’t go to get fuel,” he said. “You will get it from your home or working place, or in the context of the other things you are doing.”</p> <p>Those other things could be buying groceries or picking up prescriptions — activities that neatly fit the 20 to 40 minutes it takes to fill a battery. Wendel intends for the retailer to capture any purchases now done at the convenience store “that has wallets attached,” he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kum &amp; Go is betting on a totally different scenario — one that it hopes will preserve the stature of the filling station in the roadside landscape.</p> <p>Driving, for example, on Denver’s I-25, you see your battery is low and check an app for nearby charging prices. Kum &amp; Go gets your business because its kilowatt-hour rate is two cents cheaper than the Loaf ’N Jug across the street.</p> <p>You pull in and plug into a hybrid charging plaza, alongside the gas pumps. The car says the refill will take 20 to 40 minutes. Hungry, you head toward the little mart that sits beside most every gas station in America. But that mart has transformed. It is no longer a sterile and slightly desperate place designed to satisfy your craving for candy or a lottery ticket, with a scary bathroom and the smell of old hot dogs. Instead, you find comfortable chairs. Tables. Wi-Fi. Under soft lighting, you explore the beer cave, or pick up a made-to-order sandwich on fresh-baked bread.</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go has brought the food and comfort part of that experience to more than 100 locations already in nine states between Colorado and Michigan. The plan is to have many overlap with electric vehicle charging, Maass said.</p> <p>So it is possible that someday you will nip out to the gas station for a burrito bowl. Or maybe you won’t because the fueling station itself will have wandered off to Taco Bell, which just announced a new chain of charging stations in California. Or to Starbucks, which, as it happens, is creating a chain of its own between Seattle and Denver.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/98/2d/522249a64d50bdf5ad7eac35887e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.walgreens.jpg\"> <br> <p>Beset as they are by new competitors, gas stations believe that drivers’ deep-seated habits give them an advantage, along with their perch at busy intersections. One type of station finds itself with particularly strong leverage: the highway stop in the middle of nowhere.</p> <p>Far from the Walgreens and Starbucks, an infusion of federal money is coming. The Biden administration knows drivers won’t buy EVs without the confidence that they can charge up on road trips. As a result, the very first EV spending from the bipartisan infrastructure bill — $1 billion — is dedicated to building charging stations every 50 miles on high-use corridors. These chargers must be no more than one mile from the highway — in other words, exactly where truck stops and highway gas stations are now.</p> <p>“The gravitational force of our position will require people to realize that without us, it won’t work,” said Fialkov of NATSO, the truck stop trade group.</p> <p>The millions of new electric vehicles that soon will arrive on America’s roads have gas stations hunting for new solutions.</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go, for example, next year will try deploying a battery next to a charging station. Its stored energy could be poured into cars at peak charging times and give the fueler a measure of independence from the utility, perhaps even allowing it to wring a small profit like it does with gas. Others foresee a slog of negotiations, utility by utility. Pilot, a truck-stop operator that wants to offer chargers at 500 locations, will ask power companies to standardize their rates in order to make the financials of charging more coherent. “We have some time to spend with the utilities, and a hill to climb,” said Shameek Konar, Pilot’s CEO.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/5e/0e/8f6979f44f75913bac9848ce03a9/mag.Ferris.EVStation.ender.jpg\"> <br> <p>And gas stations haven’t given up on fighting utilities just because they lost out on the infrastructure bill. Early this year, the gas station lobby formed a new trade group called the Charge Ahead Partnership, made up mostly of gas-pump owners but aspiring to widen its utility pressure campaign to other charging-curious retailers, like grocers and shopping malls. “Public utilities currently have an unfair advantage over this new marketplace,” the group said in a statement last month.</p> <p>As they trade blows over who controls the electricity and how much it costs, both utilities and convenience stores are mindful that tomorrow’s charging network will be shaped by the preferences of people like Jennifer Sirani.</p> <p>In June, Sirani ran into trouble in Wyoming. She was braving a trip from Idaho to Nebraska for her sister’s wedding in her new electric Kia Niro. Between Rock Springs and Laramie, a 200-mile charging desert, Sirani realized her battery was dying. Salvation took the form of truck stop. There she got a tow truck that pulled her 20 miles to a charging station down the line.</p> <p>The following day, as she refilled yet again at Kum &amp; Go’s charging station in Wellington, she cast an eye at the gas pumps and the little convenience mart. One day that shop could satisfy her long wait with a healthy protein bowl, but today it’s just potato chips and Gatorade.</p> <p>“Here is OK,” she concluded. “At the Walmart, there’s a little more to do.”<br></p> <br> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"WELLINGTON, Colo. — In the farthest Denver suburbs, just off Interstate 25 stands a gas station called Kum & Go that doesn’t look like a battle zone. But it is.\n One clue is in plain sight as you look around during the boring few minutes it takes to top off your tank. Plopped in the corner of the lot like an afterthought are four vertical red slabs.\n They’re electric vehicle charging stations, capable of reviving an EV and its battery in about half an hour. It is no exaggeration to say they could be the most disruptive thing ever to confront that century-old fixture of the American roadside: the gas station. As more Americans drive their shiny new electric vehicles onto the highway and wonder where to go when the battery nears empty, charging stations are the agents of a revolutionary fill-up — not of gallons but kilowatts, not five-minute “stops” but half-hour “experiences” that could completely transform the tenor of the road trip.\n These pumps and plugs facing each other across the asphalt are also totems of an unseen battle. Two titans of the energy sector — electric companies and gas stations — have peacefully coexisted for a century but now find themselves vying for the right to serve electric vehicle owners. In just the last nine months, automakers have sold over 576,000 EVs, a 70-percent jump over the same period last year, according to auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. A burst of investment in both vehicles and chargers from automakers and the feds suggest that’s just the beginning. Ford and General Motors, America’s two biggest automakers, and the Biden administration have coalesced around a goal of electrifying half of new cars by 2030.\n Crucial to that future is a nationwide network of charging stations. Who controls those stations and the fuel coursing through them is the flash point of a fight between the electric utility and the convenience store. The outcome will impact where Americans charge their EVs and how much they pay.\n As both gas stations and power companies hang their future on the electric vehicle, the fight has gotten ugly. In fact, heads have already rolled. One electric utility, Southern California Edison, forced the resignation of a key lobbyist in order to kneecap the gas station industry as Congress considered President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging stations. The spigot of federal dollars only increased with the passage in August of the big federal climate-energy bill, stuffed with incentives to restructure the auto industry around EVs.\n \n  \n This collision between electricity and gasoline is in sharp relief at Kum & Go, a chain of almost 400 filling stations and convenience marts in 11 states that has invited the electric vehicle to disrupt its business model. Wellington is the final settlement of metro Denver before the plains spread north toward Wyoming. Alongside the grind of I-25, next to a McDonald's, stands the Kum & Go with its sign advertising the latest price for unleaded. It’s one of six Kum & Go stations in the state that have embraced electric vehicle charging. Other gas station chains sometimes host charging stations owned by someone else, often Tesla. But Kum & Go has branded these stations in its red-and-white color scheme.\n In 2018, Kum & Go set the goal of “being known as the place that has EV charging,” said Jacob Maass, the company’s commercial fuel manager. This year, as electric vehicles have begun to seem inevitable and the Biden administration spends big to construct a network of 500,000 fast-charging stations, some of the country’s biggest fueling chains have joined the parade, including Pilot Co. and 7-Eleven.\n But success hinges on resolving fundamental disputes over who has the right to sell electricity, and for how much.\n The supply chain that underpins the gas station — starting in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia or Texas and flowing through intermediaries to that big price on the sign — becomes something else entirely in the EV age. What replaces it is a system of stupefying complexity. The price a station host pays for the new fuel is determined by which of America’s 3,000 electric utilities the plugs happen to be connected to. This pricing system is invisible to the driver but presents an existential dilemma for gas station owners. They find themselves at the mercy of an opaque, highly regulated and monopolistic electricity system that is the exact opposite of the one they have thrived on for decades. \n EV charging involves “an electricity market structure that was not designed for — and is, not surprisingly, incompatible with — the retail fuel market,” said A.J. Siccardi, a fueling executive, in testimony to Congress last summer that caused sparks between the two camps.\n It is possible that gas stations and electric companies will sort through their thicket of disagreements so that gas stations can make money filling batteries, while also (strangely enough) becoming a cool place to hang out. Or it’s possible that the fueling station as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by battery refills in home garages, at workplace parking lots or at Starbucks, while the driver nurses a venti latte.\n In other words, these electric cubes on the Colorado roadside are either the dominoes that trigger the gas station’s revolution, or the headstones that mark its grave.\n \n \nAmerica’s 20th-century economic growth was powered by the electric grid and the gas station. But as businesses, they couldn’t be more different.\n The gas station arrived in the early 1900s, soon after the car itself, and quickly became a cutthroat game. Because the fuels they sold were nearly identical, sellers could differentiate themselves only by lowering prices. The only way to survive on those rock-bottom prices was to sell more gas. These imperatives drew fuelers to high-traffic intersections, where they broadcasted their prices from huge billboards. Today, America’s 120,000 gas stations are one of the most transparent, hyper-competitive markets in America.\n \n  \n Unlike gasoline, electricity was not a street-corner hustle. People wanted it everywhere. Competing for business didn’t make sense because the wiring was so expensive. The grid wasn’t a business, really, but an essential public service — a utility. A social compact emerged where the electric utility would bear the cost of building and maintaining the grid, and in exchange would enjoy a territorial monopoly. To prevent abuse, each state created a public utility commission to oversee the utility’s complicated pricing schedules. The electric company became one of the most complex, obscure and uncompetitive markets in America. \n And then came the electric vehicle.\n It short-circuited what had been a symbiotic relationship. After all, gas stations and power companies are each other’s customers. The station illuminates its sign with electricity, and the utility fills its repair trucks with gasoline. Financially, the two are now nearly at parity: The convenience-store industry made $428 billion last year selling fuel, while corporate utilities earned $424 billion selling electricity. But the electric vehicle will inexorably tilt the playing field in the utility’s favor. That’s because with the onset of the EV, the dominant fuel will become electricity — and the utility controls it all.\n The utility monopoly is so basic to modern life that it goes unnoticed. But it explains why there’s never a usage fee for plugging in your laptop at the coffee shop, or for running the hotel hairdryer until your hairdo is crisp. Charging for electricity is illegal unless you’re the electric company.\n \n  \n As electric vehicles started taking hold, it occurred to many entrepreneurs that fueling them could be a moneymaker. But they faced an odd financial barrier. The fueler pays the utility for the electricity, but can’t ask the driver to share the cost. So, companies found workarounds. Some providers charged for the time spent plugged in. Others assessed a session fee. (Until two years ago, Tesla Inc., the EV market leader, let many of its drivers refuel at its Supercharger stations for free.) No strategy reflected the actual cost, but they were a start. Business needed a change to the law — an exemption that would, for the first time, allow someone other than a power company to sell electricity.\n Delia Meier, a senior vice president at Iowa 80, a chain of truck stops, took a leading position in Iowa to open the market to ‘charge for charging,’ as it’s sometimes called. “There’s a lot of red tape, a lot of things that probably don’t make any sense,” she said. The Iowa Utilities Board rarely met and moved slow. Meier’s regional utility, Alliant Energy, would request additional hearings, and submit objections at the last minute. To Meier, it seemed the utility was conducting a passive, faceless resistance, using its unmatched savvy before the utility board to wear down any who would challenge its monopoly status.\n “The whole time it seemed like people were agreeing with us,” Meier said. “Then (the board) would have a hearing and decide not to do anything about it. It went on and on and on.”\n In a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News, Alliant said, “We are excited to be on the leading edge of electrification efforts and work hard to understand and meet our customers’ needs.”\n \n In 2019, after a three-year process, Iowa relaxed its rules so stations like Iowa 80 can charge its customers any price for electric fuel, just like gasoline. Most states have done the same. The main lobbyists who forced the issue weren’t gas stations, but new companies whose bread and butter were charging stations — EVgo Inc., ChargePoint Holdings Inc. and, of course, Tesla. Alongside them were environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that a transition to electric vehicles — necessary to head off the climate crisis — couldn’t happen without a financial incentive to sell electric fuel to drivers. Today, only seven states still regulate EV charging as the exclusive domain of the electric company.\n But even with the freedom to charge customers what they want, gas station owners still think that the utility has stacked the deck against them.\n One reason is that some utilities also own and operate charging stations. They do so with their ratepayers’ money, in plans approved by regulators. Generally, this happens sparingly and in areas shunned by private industry. But convenience store owners fear the utility as a competitor because the utility has a state-allotted profit built into each of its investments. They worry this padding could lead the utility to set a new floor for fuel prices that the gas station can’t match.\n Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, explained it this way to Georgia lawmakers last year. Her 6,500 members “have to use the electricity from only one utility. If that same electricity provider is allowed to provide electric fueling stations … taking zero capital risk like the private sector will, they will create and maintain a monopoly in this market.”\n Gas station owners say their resistance to the electric company is not an effort to slow the transition away from their marquee product. “We have no more commitment to fossil fuels than we do to Snickers bars,” said Brian Young, the owner of a chain of gas stations in eastern Alabama. Rather, it’s that the prospect of installing a charging station is intimidatingly expensive.\n Convenience stores make tiny profits on gasoline and diesel. “Whether we sell at one dollar or four dollars,” Young said, “we still make 14 cents.” In this low-margin world, a fast charger is a monster investment. The hardware can cost $150,000 or more, according to a 2019 study by think tank RMI. It is a bracing risk, especially since no one knows exactly where future EV drivers will want to fuel. \n “Honestly, I’m dreading it, but maybe there’s a silver lining,” said Bob Bajwa, the owner of a gas station in Ritzville, Wash., on the prospect of transitioning to EVs. He’s being somewhat optimistic given his personal experience. Bajwa already has one charging station — installed on his property in 2015 by charging provider EVgo — that gets only the occasional customer and produces almost no revenue.\n The convenience stores know they are overmatched. It’s hard to imagine a future without an electric grid, but one without gas stations can be pretty easily conjured. The fuelers can’t unseat the utility as the kingpin. But a crucial question remains: What will the fuel cost?\n \n \nOut of sight, utilities and EV station hosts are locked in a furious pricing battle. It threatens to create an uneven charging network where stations are eagerly built in some areas and shunned in others.\n It comes down to an obscure set of maps. They demarcate the lines between utility service territories. Kum & Go’s decision to put its charging station in Wellington was not an accident. It has a lot to do with the fact that Wellington sits in the territory of Xcel Energy Inc., the state’s largest utility. The consequences would be different if the station was built five blocks to the north, where the territory of a different utility, Poudre Valley REA, begins. The same is true six miles to the south, where power service transfers to yet another provider, the city of Fort Collins.\n \n  \n One reason Kum & Go chose to put its station in Xcel’s territory, and not in Fort Collins or Poudre Valley, is the electricity bill. In particular, it comes down to one line item, a fee that homeowners know nothing about, but some businesses know only too well.\n It’s called a demand charge. It is a base fee that gets multiplied. The multiplier is the kilowatt, the basic measurement of electrons. The fee is assessed on the few minutes of the monthly billing cycle when the customer is using the most kilowatts. Power companies have always charged this kind of fee as a means to recover the substantial cost of providing service to the customers who need a lot of electrical infrastructure. But the rationale goes haywire when applied to electric vehicles.\n That’s because an electric vehicle fast charger sucks energy like a black hole.\n “The draw is incredible,” said Meier of the Iowa 80 truck stop. She installed a couple of fast chargers last year. This type, technically known as a direct-current fast charger, is the natural choice for fueling-on-the-go because it fills a battery in anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the charger and the car model, compared to the slower systems that EV owners put in the home garage that can take all night. If two electric cars arrive and plug in at the same time, the electricity flow becomes a flood. The two fast chargers at Meier’s truck stop can use as much juice in their peak moments as the center’s six restaurants, 56,000 square-foot store, gas pumps and back offices combined.\n This sudden slurp of electricity can vault a gas station from the power stature of, say, a warehouse into the tier of heavy-duty power users such as an aluminum factory or a large farm with lots of irrigation pumps. But there’s a crucial difference: The factory or farm can plan its electricity use to avoid the sting of high demand charges. The host of a charging station cannot. At some moment beyond the gas station’s control, a flock of EVs will descend simultaneously, and the bill goes stratospheric.\n Those demand charges become an enormous burden. Electrify America, a leading charging provider, says that demand charges are up to 80 percent of the cost of operating a charging station.\n \n  \n A look at these power companies’ rates reveals why Kum & Go was motivated to put its EV chargers in Wellington. If four electric vehicles plug into Kum & Go’s four chargers at the same moment, they require the utility to summon 250 kilowatts. In Wellington, in the realm of power company Xcel, that kilowattage yields a monthly demand charge of $750. If the station moved south to Fort Collins, the charge rises to $2,672. If Kum & Go plugged in to the north, in Poudre Valley, it would rise to $4,750. That’s six times the cost in Wellington.\n Finding utility territories with lower demand charges has become “a checkpoint for us before we approve a site,” said Maass. As for the territories with higher demand charges, he said: “We’re trying to avoid it the best we can.”\n Heading north on I-25, a Denver driver glides across five utility territories without even noticing. But for the gas-station operator, they are a hazardous game of hopscotch. These random power fiefs are not just a Denver thing, either: Each of the country’s 3,000 electric utilities has its own demand-charge regime, none having a logical relationship to their neighbors.\n “Literally they can put it on the other side of the freeway and it will be much cheaper,” said John Phelan, an energy services manager of Fort Collins’ utility.\n Profit isn’t yet an option. With expensive equipment and few users, the convenience store’s best outcome is to break even. “We’re trying to cover the cost of the electricity bill,” said Meier of Iowa 80, “and I think that’s all that anyone can expect at this point.”\n Kum & Go knows the pain of this math. Ken Kleemeier, its vice president of fuels, gives the example of a 150-kilowatt charging session with a $6 demand charge. Six dollars times 150 kilowatts means the electricity bill is $900. But “we charge the customer $10,” Kleemeier said. “That’s a $900 loss. That’s where the demand charges are painful. There’s no feasible way to pass that along.”\n The utilities believe the demand-charge burden is temporary. As electric vehicles become more common, a charging station’s “utilization rate” — the number of hours per day the station is in use — will increase. The demand charge will be absorbed by more and more users, and eventually turn the charging station from money pit into profit center.\n Furthermore, utilities are starting to offer “demand charge holidays.” These are a period of years where the utility voids or lowers the fee to ease the transition. Gas stations are skeptical. “When the holiday expires, you’re back to demand charges and you’re left with an investment you can’t make money off of,” said David Fialkov, head of government affairs at NATSO, a trade group for truck-stop operators.\n This multi-headed conflict has created lots of reasons for gas stations and utilities to confront each other. But no conflict has been as vicious as what happened in Washington, D.C., when billions of dollars were on the line.\n \n \nIn the spring of 2021, as Congress was laying the foundations for President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, lobbyists for both utilities and convenience stores were working overtime, framing issues this way and not that, nudging lawmakers down policy paths that could become etched in law.\n Utilities wanted at least part of the billions of dollars that Congress was mulling for EV infrastructure to go toward their strong suit: installing new power lines and equipment to feed charging stations. They argued they were a crucial link to the EV future. The gas station lobby wanted money, too, to offset the expense of building charging stations. But even more than money, they wanted leverage. They saw an opportunity to have Congress put them, not utilities, at the center of EV fueling.\n And despite their relatively small size as a lobbying force, the gas stations were scoring some wins.\n “Our advocacy on all of those fronts, I think, began to get more attention,” said Doug Kantor. At the time, Kantor was a partner at the firm Steptoe, a leading law and lobbying firm with 300 lawyers in its Washington office. For years, Kantor had led a team at Steptoe that lobbied on behalf of several trade groups that represent gas stations and convenience stores.\n In May, an ally of Kantor’s secured a spot to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A.J. Siccardi, the president of Metroplex Energy, the parent company of RaceTrac, one of the country’s biggest fueling chains, laid out a detailed agenda that would, at every turn, benefit gas stations at the expense of utilities.\n Demand charges? Abolish them, Siccardi argued, and instead make electricity available at wholesale prices, like gasoline. Subsidies for charging stations? Bar utilities from getting them if they also tapped their ratepayers’ money. A “double dip,” he called it. He also called on Congress to force all states to make gas stations legal sellers of electricity.\n Despite its financial heft, no one from the utility industry was on the panel to refute him.\n But they quickly got wind of the proposals. Louis Finkel, the head of government relations at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said he was galled by the gas station lobby’s request to abolish demand charges, a pillar of how the utilities pay for expensive projects. “If someone said they have to rip out and move their fuel tanks a half a mile,” Finkel asked, “who would have to pay for it?”\n \n  \n In June, Kantor and the gas station lobby scored another win. A group of 17 legislators sent a letter to the committee heads responsible for the EV-charging portions of the bill. Led by Rep. Lou Correa, a Democrat from California’s Orange County, it echoed gas stations’ talking points. “Fuel retailers are best positioned to own and operate EV charging stations and provide transportation energy to consumers,” the letter said.\n The way the letter put gas stations at the center of electric fueling, while limiting the electric company’s role, made some in the utility industry furious. One person was particularly put out: Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the state’s biggest utilities. Correa, the letter’s author, said he received a heated call from Pizarro. “I think he didn’t like the tone of the letter,” Correa said in an interview, adding that he said he apologized to Pizarro.\n In a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News, Southern California Edison said, “the company reached out to numerous lawmakers on provisions of the infrastructure bill,” adding that Pizarro “spoke with Congressman Correa on the important role that electric utilities, with the support and approval of state regulatory commissions, must play in ensuring the deployment of EV charging infrastructure.”\n But Edison didn’t stop there.\n In May, Kantor said, some of his partners at Steptoe reached out with uncomfortable news. It involved a request from Edison and other utility clients of Steptoe who weren’t named. Kantor said he was told that Edison had informed Steptoe that if it didn’t sever its relationship with the fueling industry, the electric utility would take its business elsewhere. Kantor described the utility’s thinking as: “Hey, strategically it would be a good thing if we sidelined Steptoe, so they couldn’t continue this advocacy,” he said. “And that was exactly what they did.” Edison declined to comment on Kantor’s story, calling it “an internal matter that is best addressed by Steptoe & Johnson,” the firm’s former name.\n \n  \n No one forced Kantor to leave, but he thought it was the best thing. (“I did not think as an adviser to my clients that I should tell them they should continue to use me when one of the most important issues to the future of the industry was something that I couldn’t work on,” he said.)\n Those shoved out of Steptoe by the utilities now hold key positions in the gas-station industry. Kantor took a new job as general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a leading gas station trade group, while two people who left with him, Jessica Frend and LeeAnn Goheen, are in top policy jobs at NATSO. Steptoe declined to comment on the specifics of Kantor’s departure but said in a statement, “We continue to work with Doug in his role at NACS. We count him as a good personal friend as well as a former colleague.”\n In the end, despite its early tactical victories, the gas station lobby got little of what it wanted in the final infrastructure bill, which Biden signed in November. The bill did not overrule “charge for charging” regulations in individual states, nor block utilities from getting infrastructure funds. It asked state electricity regulators to consider the burden of demand charges, but that request has no teeth. By virtue of its incumbency and power, the utility industry had prevailed over the gas stations. It didn’t have to win; it just had to prevent change.\n “The c-stores and truck stops say sometimes that they’re uncomfortable” with the utilities’ regulated-monopoly model, said Phil Jones, a former utility regulator who heads a utility-heavy trade group, the Alliance for Transportation Electrification. “But we’ve told them that model is not going to change.”\n \n \nThe gas station of the future might not have a single pump or even a whiff of gasoline. That’s because it might not be a gas station, but a Walgreens.\n In February, the drugstore chain said it would install fast chargers at more than 500 locations. The hardware comes from Volta Inc., a station provider whose stations double as advertising kiosks, and that also owns the financial transaction between car and charger. In June, Volta signed up the grocer Kroger Co. at locations in Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. Chris Wendel, the co-founder of Volta, thinks electric vehicles shatter the gas station’s very premise.\n “People won’t go to get fuel,” he said. “You will get it from your home or working place, or in the context of the other things you are doing.”\n Those other things could be buying groceries or picking up prescriptions — activities that neatly fit the 20 to 40 minutes it takes to fill a battery. Wendel intends for the retailer to capture any purchases now done at the convenience store “that has wallets attached,” he said.\n Meanwhile, Kum & Go is betting on a totally different scenario — one that it hopes will preserve the stature of the filling station in the roadside landscape.\n Driving, for example, on Denver’s I-25, you see your battery is low and check an app for nearby charging prices. Kum & Go gets your business because its kilowatt-hour rate is two cents cheaper than the Loaf ’N Jug across the street.\n You pull in and plug into a hybrid charging plaza, alongside the gas pumps. The car says the refill will take 20 to 40 minutes. Hungry, you head toward the little mart that sits beside most every gas station in America. But that mart has transformed. It is no longer a sterile and slightly desperate place designed to satisfy your craving for candy or a lottery ticket, with a scary bathroom and the smell of old hot dogs. Instead, you find comfortable chairs. Tables. Wi-Fi. Under soft lighting, you explore the beer cave, or pick up a made-to-order sandwich on fresh-baked bread.\n Kum & Go has brought the food and comfort part of that experience to more than 100 locations already in nine states between Colorado and Michigan. The plan is to have many overlap with electric vehicle charging, Maass said.\n So it is possible that someday you will nip out to the gas station for a burrito bowl. Or maybe you won’t because the fueling station itself will have wandered off to Taco Bell, which just announced a new chain of charging stations in California. Or to Starbucks, which, as it happens, is creating a chain of its own between Seattle and Denver.\n \n  \n Beset as they are by new competitors, gas stations believe that drivers’ deep-seated habits give them an advantage, along with their perch at busy intersections. One type of station finds itself with particularly strong leverage: the highway stop in the middle of nowhere.\n Far from the Walgreens and Starbucks, an infusion of federal money is coming. The Biden administration knows drivers won’t buy EVs without the confidence that they can charge up on road trips. As a result, the very first EV spending from the bipartisan infrastructure bill — $1 billion — is dedicated to building charging stations every 50 miles on high-use corridors. These chargers must be no more than one mile from the highway — in other words, exactly where truck stops and highway gas stations are now.\n “The gravitational force of our position will require people to realize that without us, it won’t work,” said Fialkov of NATSO, the truck stop trade group.\n The millions of new electric vehicles that soon will arrive on America’s roads have gas stations hunting for new solutions.\n Kum & Go, for example, next year will try deploying a battery next to a charging station. Its stored energy could be poured into cars at peak charging times and give the fueler a measure of independence from the utility, perhaps even allowing it to wring a small profit like it does with gas. Others foresee a slog of negotiations, utility by utility. Pilot, a truck-stop operator that wants to offer chargers at 500 locations, will ask power companies to standardize their rates in order to make the financials of charging more coherent. “We have some time to spend with the utilities, and a hill to climb,” said Shameek Konar, Pilot’s CEO.\n \n  \n And gas stations haven’t given up on fighting utilities just because they lost out on the infrastructure bill. Early this year, the gas station lobby formed a new trade group called the Charge Ahead Partnership, made up mostly of gas-pump owners but aspiring to widen its utility pressure campaign to other charging-curious retailers, like grocers and shopping malls. “Public utilities currently have an unfair advantage over this new marketplace,” the group said in a statement last month.\n As they trade blows over who controls the electricity and how much it costs, both utilities and convenience stores are mindful that tomorrow’s charging network will be shaped by the preferences of people like Jennifer Sirani.\n In June, Sirani ran into trouble in Wyoming. She was braving a trip from Idaho to Nebraska for her sister’s wedding in her new electric Kia Niro. Between Rock Springs and Laramie, a 200-mile charging desert, Sirani realized her battery was dying. Salvation took the form of truck stop. There she got a tow truck that pulled her 20 miles to a charging station down the line.\n The following day, as she refilled yet again at Kum & Go’s charging station in Wellington, she cast an eye at the gas pumps and the little convenience mart. One day that shop could satisfy her long wait with a healthy protein bowl, but today it’s just potato chips and Gatorade.\n “Here is OK,” she concluded. “At the Walmart, there’s a little more to do.”","dc:creator":"David Ferris","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/png","url":"https://static.politico.com/73/94/0351d8fc4f6eb6decfacfd348412/header-still.png"},"media:title":[{"_":"Illustrations by Rebekka Dunlap for POLITICO","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/73/94/0351d8fc4f6eb6decfacfd348412/header-still.png"}}]},"content":"Electric vehicles are changing the way Americans fuel up.

That logic seems to me to be deeply flawed.</i>”</p> <p>C-SPAN was broadcasting Vice President Dick Cheney’s speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. I scanned the audience: a sea of older veterans, gray and weathered. I thought of Bob Dole and John Glenn and Danny Inouye — colleagues all who had distinguished themselves in war as they had in peace, men who had come home with both a determination always to defend America and a hard-earned sense of reality about the horrors of battle. Cheney didn’t seem to be speaking to them. His audience was the editorial boards of the <i>Washington Post </i>and <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and the case he was making wasn’t for peace or diplomacy but war — a war of choice.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/cf/9f/1714d0c24b3f811ce68735c95eed/gettyimages-1394503.jpg\"> <br> <p>I flipped the channel. CNN was discussing new polls that claimed strong support for an attack on Iraq. I worried the administration was so caught up in its own hubris, trapped in its own bubble, misreading history and inflated polls that reflected America’s unity in a time of crisis. They seemed determined to crash right into a war of preemption — without even talking to Congress.</p> <p>I decided to go see the intelligence for myself. Given my role on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I’d always stayed in close touch with the CIA. I wanted to understand what it believed about the Middle East, rather than accepting at face value what leaders told us about these countries. I headed to a secure room in the Capitol to read the intelligence community’s best analysis of what was happening in the authoritarian police state in Baghdad. The solitude of the secure room was a grounding experience: no staff, no phones, just an individual senator and classified documents, to consider the unbiased, unvarnished findings of the intelligence community. Sometimes, we used to joke that the front page of the <i>Washington Post </i>was a better place to find out what was really happening in the intelligence community. Under Ronald Reagan, the CIA had been frustratingly porous, spouting media leaks long before the intelligence ever made its way to Congress. But since 9/11, the community had gone out of its way to be solicitous of Congress, to forge a sense that we were all wrestling with hard decisions together and deserved a common set of facts. My former staffer on the Intelligence Committee, George Tenet, a career intelligence staffer, had performed admirably in this respect.<br></p> <br> <p>Thumbing my way through the material, which was similar to the public record, what jumped out was the conclusion that Saddam Hussein <i>coveted </i>weapons of mass destruction, but the reality was that little had really changed over the years. I wondered whether the eyes of any freshman senator saw the same things that I did with five terms under my belt. Sure, Hussein had pursued weapons of mass destruction since the 1970s, and in the 1980s, we’d been his biggest benefactor as he barreled into an ill-advised war against Iran. This wasn’t new behavior for this master of miscalculation in Baghdad. Where was the smoking gun of a newly revived threat?</p> <p>Many in the administration seemed to draw tenuous connections between Hussein and al-Qaeda, but I remembered just how much he — a largely secular autocrat — had long been the target, not the patron, of al Qaeda zealots who dreamed of restoring a religious caliphate and kicking out the existing order. I read the details: The conclusion was thin; if an al Qaeda terrorist had found safe passage through Iraq en route to Iran, it was hardly a sign of Saddam’s cooperation with al Qaeda and more likely proof of Iraq’s porous border, or the old saying “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” If a terrorist thug was on his way to create chaos in Iran, the regime would happily turn a blind eye to his safe passage.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a5/e3/40aa35b145178bafc48bad720dd8/gettyimages-1249735.jpg\"> <br> <p>My conclusion was caution: I simply didn’t see proof of an imminent threat or a new rush by a madman to obtain weapons of mass destruction. I saw the status quo as it had been for a long time. “<i>Looks like the Middle East,</i>” I said to the intelligence officer sitting at the desk.</p> <p>The following Sunday, [my wife] Marcelle and I went for our usual early-morning walk in the neighborhood. It was a warm September day, and we walked hand in hand.</p> <p>Two fit joggers trailed behind us. They stopped and asked what I thought of the intelligence briefings I’d been getting. Marcelle realized this was a conversation that normally she would not be involved in and kept on walking ahead.</p> <p>I went through a requisite disclaimer that if I was in briefings and if they were classified, I could not acknowledge that they even occurred and could not talk about them if they had. They told me they understood that, but asked whether the briefers had showed me File Eight.</p> <p>It was obvious from the look on my face that I had not seen such a file. They suggested I should and that I might find it interesting. Quickly thereafter I arranged to see File Eight, and it contradicted much of what I had heard from the Bush administration.</p> <p>Days later, Marcelle and I were out walking again when the two joggers reappeared. After the opening greetings, they told me they understood I had seen File Eight and asked what did I think about it?</p> <p>It was the eeriest conversation I’d experienced in Washington. I felt like a senatorial version of Bob Woodward meeting Deep Throat — only in broad daylight.</p> <p>I went through the usual disclaimers that I could not talk about any file and if such a file was available and so on. They said of course they understood, but they wondered if I had also been shown File Twelve, using a code word.</p> <p>Again, I think the look on my face gave them the answer. They apologized for interrupting our walk and jogged off. The next day, I was back in the secure room in the Capitol to read File Twelve, and it again contradicted the statements that the administration, and especially Vice President Cheney, seemed to be relying on, and I told my staff and others that for a number of reasons I absolutely intended to vote against the war in Iraq.</p> <p>I’d been around too long to do differently. It is hard to think of any vote that is taken by the Senate that is more important than voting to go to war or not. While we never had a declaration of war in Vietnam, the falsehoods and misleading information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin episode brought about a vote in the Senate that guaranteed the continuation of the war. Only one senator voted no. Had the Senate asked more questions — had it drilled down into the facts — who knows how history could’ve been different? Instead, that war went on for years and thousands of deaths later, until it was officially ended by a one-vote margin in the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Senate in 1975.</p> <p>I wasn’t alone in questioning the intelligence about Iraq. A conservative Democrat from Florida, Bob Graham, was the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and urged everyone to read the intelligence, which he could not talk about on the floor or in open meetings. His warnings and those of Senator Carl Levin, the lead Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, were a contrast to the administration’s cheerleaders urging senators to meet with a man named Ahmed Chalabi, source of many of the stories that the <i>New York Times </i>and others had printed claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. I refused to meet with him, as I knew his reputation for falsehoods was high and that the press who had backed him were being fooled. The intelligence community referred to him as “Curveball” for a reason.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/3d/9f/1305b109480ca7ad96b2c79e13c2/ap03041801618.jpg\"> <br> <p>That Sunday after church, Marcelle and I were out walking through McLean, going by Hickory Hill, the former Robert Kennedy estate, as black cars with multiple antennas and darkened windows passed us by. That was not unusual because of various officials in the administration who lived out in that area. As we reached Georgetown Pike, right by the Quaker meetinghouse, one of the vehicles pulled up. A member of the presidential inner circle leaned out from the back window, greeting both myself and Marcelle, and asked if he could talk with me. We were about a half-mile from home, and she continued on walking. I got in the car with him while the security people got out of the car. We sat there and talked, and he said, “I understand you’ve seen File Eight and Twelve.” I said I had, and I knew of course that he’d seen them. He said, “I also understand you’re going to vote against going to war.”</p> <p>I said, “I am, because we all know there are no weapons of mass destruction and the reasons for going to war are just not there.”</p> <p>He asked if he could talk me out of that, and I said no, and we ended the conversation. I started to get out of the car, and he said they would give me a ride home.</p> <p>“Thanks — let me tell you where I live.”</p> <p>“<i>We know where you live.</i>”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/88/74/06a9c7084e88b731f58de4eeed03/ap21291478050881.jpg\"> <br> <p>In caucus on Tuesday, the debate continued. The administration was grudgingly coming to Congress to negotiate a use of force resolution, something that many senators believed could actually be a tool to prevent a war. But I suspected the die was cast.</p> <p>“<i>I heard James Baker convinced William Safire to write that skeptical column to convince the president to tread carefully,</i>” said one of my earnest colleagues.</p> <p>Washington’s latest parlor game was fixated on whether the people around the president’s father were using third parties to persuade this President Bush not to rush into war. Secretary of State Colin Powell had become the vessel into which they’d poured all their hopes that diplomacy would prevail, that together, we’d be “tough” on Saddam Hussein without an invasion. I feared it was an elusive unicorn they were hunting for — it would’ve been great to find it, but ultimately it was a fiction.</p> <p>“<i>I spoke to Colin Powell. He said that if we have a smart resolution, if we force Bush to go to the UN, we empower the diplomacy so they come our way,</i>” said another colleague.</p> <p>It was a glass-half-full way of looking at the situation. They believed they could shape the White House’s trajectory.</p> <p>“<i>Well, I can’t tell you what’s going on in President Bush’s head,</i>” I said. “<i>So, I’ll just have to trust my own eyes.

That logic seems to me to be deeply flawed.”\n C-SPAN was broadcasting Vice President Dick Cheney’s speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. I scanned the audience: a sea of older veterans, gray and weathered. I thought of Bob Dole and John Glenn and Danny Inouye — colleagues all who had distinguished themselves in war as they had in peace, men who had come home with both a determination always to defend America and a hard-earned sense of reality about the horrors of battle. Cheney didn’t seem to be speaking to them. His audience was the editorial boards of the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, and the case he was making wasn’t for peace or diplomacy but war — a war of choice.\n \n  \n I flipped the channel. CNN was discussing new polls that claimed strong support for an attack on Iraq. I worried the administration was so caught up in its own hubris, trapped in its own bubble, misreading history and inflated polls that reflected America’s unity in a time of crisis. They seemed determined to crash right into a war of preemption — without even talking to Congress.\n I decided to go see the intelligence for myself. Given my role on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I’d always stayed in close touch with the CIA. I wanted to understand what it believed about the Middle East, rather than accepting at face value what leaders told us about these countries. I headed to a secure room in the Capitol to read the intelligence community’s best analysis of what was happening in the authoritarian police state in Baghdad. The solitude of the secure room was a grounding experience: no staff, no phones, just an individual senator and classified documents, to consider the unbiased, unvarnished findings of the intelligence community. Sometimes, we used to joke that the front page of the Washington Post was a better place to find out what was really happening in the intelligence community. Under Ronald Reagan, the CIA had been frustratingly porous, spouting media leaks long before the intelligence ever made its way to Congress. But since 9/11, the community had gone out of its way to be solicitous of Congress, to forge a sense that we were all wrestling with hard decisions together and deserved a common set of facts. My former staffer on the Intelligence Committee, George Tenet, a career intelligence staffer, had performed admirably in this respect.\n \n Thumbing my way through the material, which was similar to the public record, what jumped out was the conclusion that Saddam Hussein coveted weapons of mass destruction, but the reality was that little had really changed over the years. I wondered whether the eyes of any freshman senator saw the same things that I did with five terms under my belt. Sure, Hussein had pursued weapons of mass destruction since the 1970s, and in the 1980s, we’d been his biggest benefactor as he barreled into an ill-advised war against Iran. This wasn’t new behavior for this master of miscalculation in Baghdad. Where was the smoking gun of a newly revived threat?\n Many in the administration seemed to draw tenuous connections between Hussein and al-Qaeda, but I remembered just how much he — a largely secular autocrat — had long been the target, not the patron, of al Qaeda zealots who dreamed of restoring a religious caliphate and kicking out the existing order. I read the details: The conclusion was thin; if an al Qaeda terrorist had found safe passage through Iraq en route to Iran, it was hardly a sign of Saddam’s cooperation with al Qaeda and more likely proof of Iraq’s porous border, or the old saying “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” If a terrorist thug was on his way to create chaos in Iran, the regime would happily turn a blind eye to his safe passage.\n \n  \n My conclusion was caution: I simply didn’t see proof of an imminent threat or a new rush by a madman to obtain weapons of mass destruction. I saw the status quo as it had been for a long time. “Looks like the Middle East,” I said to the intelligence officer sitting at the desk.\n The following Sunday, [my wife] Marcelle and I went for our usual early-morning walk in the neighborhood. It was a warm September day, and we walked hand in hand.\n Two fit joggers trailed behind us. They stopped and asked what I thought of the intelligence briefings I’d been getting. Marcelle realized this was a conversation that normally she would not be involved in and kept on walking ahead.\n I went through a requisite disclaimer that if I was in briefings and if they were classified, I could not acknowledge that they even occurred and could not talk about them if they had. They told me they understood that, but asked whether the briefers had showed me File Eight.\n It was obvious from the look on my face that I had not seen such a file. They suggested I should and that I might find it interesting. Quickly thereafter I arranged to see File Eight, and it contradicted much of what I had heard from the Bush administration.\n Days later, Marcelle and I were out walking again when the two joggers reappeared. After the opening greetings, they told me they understood I had seen File Eight and asked what did I think about it?\n It was the eeriest conversation I’d experienced in Washington. I felt like a senatorial version of Bob Woodward meeting Deep Throat — only in broad daylight.\n I went through the usual disclaimers that I could not talk about any file and if such a file was available and so on. They said of course they understood, but they wondered if I had also been shown File Twelve, using a code word.\n Again, I think the look on my face gave them the answer. They apologized for interrupting our walk and jogged off. The next day, I was back in the secure room in the Capitol to read File Twelve, and it again contradicted the statements that the administration, and especially Vice President Cheney, seemed to be relying on, and I told my staff and others that for a number of reasons I absolutely intended to vote against the war in Iraq.\n I’d been around too long to do differently. It is hard to think of any vote that is taken by the Senate that is more important than voting to go to war or not. While we never had a declaration of war in Vietnam, the falsehoods and misleading information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin episode brought about a vote in the Senate that guaranteed the continuation of the war. Only one senator voted no. Had the Senate asked more questions — had it drilled down into the facts — who knows how history could’ve been different? Instead, that war went on for years and thousands of deaths later, until it was officially ended by a one-vote margin in the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Senate in 1975.\n I wasn’t alone in questioning the intelligence about Iraq. A conservative Democrat from Florida, Bob Graham, was the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and urged everyone to read the intelligence, which he could not talk about on the floor or in open meetings. His warnings and those of Senator Carl Levin, the lead Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, were a contrast to the administration’s cheerleaders urging senators to meet with a man named Ahmed Chalabi, source of many of the stories that the New York Times and others had printed claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. I refused to meet with him, as I knew his reputation for falsehoods was high and that the press who had backed him were being fooled. The intelligence community referred to him as “Curveball” for a reason.\n \n  \n That Sunday after church, Marcelle and I were out walking through McLean, going by Hickory Hill, the former Robert Kennedy estate, as black cars with multiple antennas and darkened windows passed us by. That was not unusual because of various officials in the administration who lived out in that area. As we reached Georgetown Pike, right by the Quaker meetinghouse, one of the vehicles pulled up. A member of the presidential inner circle leaned out from the back window, greeting both myself and Marcelle, and asked if he could talk with me. We were about a half-mile from home, and she continued on walking. I got in the car with him while the security people got out of the car. We sat there and talked, and he said, “I understand you’ve seen File Eight and Twelve.” I said I had, and I knew of course that he’d seen them. He said, “I also understand you’re going to vote against going to war.”\n I said, “I am, because we all know there are no weapons of mass destruction and the reasons for going to war are just not there.”\n He asked if he could talk me out of that, and I said no, and we ended the conversation. I started to get out of the car, and he said they would give me a ride home.\n “Thanks — let me tell you where I live.”\n “We know where you live.”\n \n  \n In caucus on Tuesday, the debate continued. The administration was grudgingly coming to Congress to negotiate a use of force resolution, something that many senators believed could actually be a tool to prevent a war. But I suspected the die was cast.\n “I heard James Baker convinced William Safire to write that skeptical column to convince the president to tread carefully,” said one of my earnest colleagues.\n Washington’s latest parlor game was fixated on whether the people around the president’s father were using third parties to persuade this President Bush not to rush into war. Secretary of State Colin Powell had become the vessel into which they’d poured all their hopes that diplomacy would prevail, that together, we’d be “tough” on Saddam Hussein without an invasion. I feared it was an elusive unicorn they were hunting for — it would’ve been great to find it, but ultimately it was a fiction.\n “I spoke to Colin Powell. He said that if we have a smart resolution, if we force Bush to go to the UN, we empower the diplomacy so they come our way,” said another colleague.\n It was a glass-half-full way of looking at the situation. They believed they could shape the White House’s trajectory.\n “Well, I can’t tell you what’s going on in President Bush’s head,” I said. “So, I’ll just have to trust my own eyes. I don’t think they’re making the case for why they need this authorization now if they don’t intend to use it. Why the hurry? I watch the vice president’s speeches. I don’t think he’s freelancing. And if he is — well, that’s a whole other problem. I think they’re telling us they want to go to war in the worst way. And I’m afraid they really will go to war in the worst way.”\n Days later, I spoke in opposition to the Iraq War authorization.\n It passed 77–23.\n \n  \n My colleagues who made up the overwhelming majority did so for various reasons. I remembered Mike Mansfield’s argument to never question anyone’s motives, just their position. Some probably did fear Bush’s commanding poll numbers and his ability to weaponize national security against them. Others believed the intelligence, and still others genuinely believed that they were empowering diplomacy, that this vote didn’t mean what it said it meant, which was that the president could go to war with our blessing.

Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who had encountered DePape before the attack. “Words have consequences, and without question, the GOP’s hate and extremism has bred political violence.”\n Police said DePape wrestled a hammer from Pelosi inside their home in the Pacific Heights neighborhood and struck him several times. The 82-year-old husband of the speaker was hospitalized but expected to recover.\n \n \n Until now, the suspect was known to be part of a group of pro-nudist activists based across the Bay in Berkeley.\n A photo published by the San Francisco Chronicle, and released after his arrest, shows DePape presiding, fully clothed, over the wedding of otherwise nude activists outside City Hall in 2013.\n The paper said he was known as a “father figure” in a Berkeley group home that included a well known nudist activist known as Gypsy Taub. At the time of the wedding he was identified as a hemp jewelry maker. Wiener told the Chronicle that DePape was among a number of nude activists who protested around San Francisco in 2011 and 2012.\n In more recent years, DePape has embraced the false claims that the November 2020 election was stolen, reposting on Facebook — in an account since removed from the platform — bogus claims by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and others associated with the campaign.\n \n He reposted a video on YouTube denouncing the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as a “farce,” according to CNN.\n A blog featuring content authored by DePape offers a patchwork embrace of bigoted and fringe topics, including posts that feature anti-Semitic language, allege the existence of a “communist” agenda in schools and repeat many of the tropes of the online fever dream known as QAnon, which alleges without evidence that leading figures engage in pedophilia.\n An archived page from another, now-defunct website also attributed to DePape suggests fury toward the government, the mainstream media and corporate powers, decrying “the elites/ruling class” and “the people who rule you” while warning “Tech giants and private industry” have become “so powerful they could single handedly silence the people.”\n It was enough for many leading Democrats to conclude that toxic political rhetoric was behind the attack, even without authorities disclosing a motive. “While the motive is still unknown we know where this kind of violence is sanctioned and modeled,” Rep.

He had retired after the 1956 season but was still hugely popular, having broken baseball’s color barrier 13 years earlier. And he had a decision to make: Who was he going to back in the presidential election that fall?</p> <p>Robinson’s endorsement was so valuable that both John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon personally courted him. And in turn, the baseball icon vetted each candidate, hard. As the election approached, he met with both men on the same day, a kind of job interview for his support.</p> <p>Robinson was an active supporter of the civil rights movement, and most Black Americans backed Kennedy. But Robinson had signaled early in 1960 that Democrats shouldn’t take Blacks’ support for granted. While his first choice for president had been a Democrat, civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey, Robinson made it clear that he was intrigued by Nixon as well.</p> <p>“Though the Democratic nominee is still undetermined at this point, it would be folly to underestimate the impression Nixon’s generally good civil rights record has made among Negroes,” Robinson wrote in a column published in the <i>Chicago Defender</i>, a Black newspaper, in January 1960. “I’ve been following Nixon’s career for some time now, and I don’t mind admitting that generally I’ve liked what I’ve seen and heard.”</p> <p>Robinson added that while Nixon’s record wasn’t as good as Humphrey’s, it was still “very attractive” compared to other Democratic candidates. “Many people whom I’ve talked with, whose first concern is civil rights, would not hesitate to support Vice President Nixon.”</p> <p>Robinson recognized that liberals disliked Nixon for how he had trashed his Democratic opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in his victorious 1950 Senate election. And, as he acknowledged in his autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>I Never Had It Made</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>I Never Had It Made</i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>“there was a great deal of suspicion in the black community about Nixon.” But he defended the vice president, writing that “in the years he’s been prominent in national affairs, Mr. Nixon has grown more than any other person presently in political life.”</p> <p>At the time, the parties were not as ideologically uniform as they are today — there were liberal Republicans and Democratic segregationists. And Robinson wasn’t ready to commit to Democrats if they didn’t nominate Humphrey, which they didn’t, leaving Robinson with a tough choice: Pick an untested Democrat or openly flout the preference of the Black community and support the Republican.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/0f/04/dba78e5a4a51aab785da8e16acf5/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>So, a few weeks before the mid-July Democratic National Convention, Robinson had his doubleheader of meetings with Nixon and Kennedy.</p> <p>In Nixon’s office, the vice president “said all the right things,” Robinson recalled in his autobiography. However, he was put off when he heard Nixon take a call and say, “No, well, I can’t do that. I’m tired of pulling his chestnuts out of this fire. He’ll have to work his own way out of this one.” After hanging up, Nixon told Robinson he had been talking about President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “It sounded as if the Vice President wanted me to disassociate him from Eisenhower since he knew that blacks, in the main, didn’t like Ike,” Robinson wrote. “It had the feel of a cheap trick.”</p> <p>But he had a much worse impression of Kennedy, whom he met with at a private home in Washington later that day.</p> <p>“My very first reaction to the Senator was one of doubt because he couldn’t or wouldn’t look me straight in the eye,” Robinson recalled, and he wound up writing a letter to JFK suggesting he do so in the future.</p> <p>“My second reaction, much more substantial, was that this was a man who had served in the Senate and wanted to be President but who knew little or nothing about black problems and sensibilities. He himself admitted a lack of any depth of understanding about black people … I was appalled that he could be so ignorant of our situation and be bidding for the highest office in the land.”</p> <p>That did it. Jackie Robinson chose Richard Nixon.<br></p> <br> <p>He told the leaders at Washington’s African Methodist Church that he asked the same questions of both candidates, and while Nixon gave straightforward answers, “I had to challenge Kennedy six times.”</p> <p>Robinson’s decision to support Nixon was controversial. It earned him the enmity of some Black leaders, including Malcolm X, but Robinson didn’t waver. Later, he would even support another Republican for president, moderate Nelson Rockefeller.</p> <p>“That was a pretty gutsy thing for him to do, considering the entire black establishment was behind John F. Kennedy, but Jackie Robinson had unique experience in breaking through in the white world,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;recalled William Safire&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">recalled William Safire</a>, a young Nixon aide at the time. “The athlete with the greatest positive influence on black-white relations since the boxer Joe Louis was not the sort to flinch at being called an Uncle Tom for supporting a Republican.”</p> <p>It was also a decision Robinson came to regret.</p> <p>In the coming years, he became disillusioned not just with Nixon, but with the Republican Party. The GOP had moved steadily to the right through the turbulent 1960s, embracing a strategy of pandering to Southern whites that threatened civil rights gains spearheaded by the Democrats. When Nixon sought the presidency again eight years later, Robinson denounced him in a column headlined, “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America.” Robinson would die in 1972, half a century before the reactionary forces he saw emerging ultimately came to dominate the GOP.<br></p> <br> <p><b>The relationship</b> between Nixon and Robinson dated back to 1952, when Robinson was a star player in his prime and Nixon was a U.S. senator running as Eisenhower’s vice presidential running mate, on their way to winning the White House.</p> <p>Nixon was a huge sports fan and something of a fanboy, and had a hard time curbing his enthusiasm when he met Robinson at that year’s Republican National Convention in Chicago. <a href=\"https://books.google.com.ai/books?id=ym0IFRp5F84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;According to Harrison McCall&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://books.google.com.ai/books?id=ym0IFRp5F84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">According to Harrison McCall</a>, president of the California Republican Assembly, who introduced the two men, Nixon told Robinson about first seeing him compete in a UCLA football game in 1939 — and about a specific play that stood out all these years later.</p> <p>“I said to Nixon as we walked away that, while Robinson had undoubtedly met a lot of notables in his career, nevertheless I was sure there was one person he would never forget,” McCall said.</p> <p>Nixon also watched Robinson play for the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field, including the World Series that fall, which the New York Yankees won in seven games. The two men were around the same age — Nixon was born six years earlier, in 1913 — and they both grew up in California, although under far different circumstances.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e9/9a/355b4ca64360b5f1655d69bd4e2d/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>By 1957, a year after Robinson retired, he was praising Nixon for a speech in Ethiopia in which the vice president declared that the U.S. will never be satisfied until all Americans have equal opportunity. “In this endeavor,” Robinson wrote in one of many letters to Nixon, “you have my best wishes and steadfast cooperation.”</p> <p>“Dear Jackie,” Nixon replied. “As you can imagine, there were a number of letters on my desk when I returned to the office today after an absence of three weeks. I can assure you, however, that there were none which meant more to me than your thoughtful letter of March 19.” He called it a “privilege” to be working with Robinson “to achieve the important objective of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all Americans, and your expression of approval will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to me.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>So Nixon had built up</b> a groundswell of goodwill with Robinson in the years leading up to the 1960 election. But he soon squandered it.</p> <p>A key incident took place in October 1960, when Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed in Georgia. Nixon sat on his hands while the Kennedy campaign acted decisively. JFK called King’s wife, Coretta, to express support, and worked behind the scenes to press for King’s release. After he was freed, King publicly thanked JFK for his role and pointedly said he hadn’t heard from Nixon.</p> <p>At the Nixon campaign, Robinson had pushed for a robust response from his candidate.</p> <p>“He has to do this,” Robinson said at the time, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;1987 Safire column&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">1987 Safire column</a> in the <i>New York Times</i>. “He has to call Martin right now, today. I have the number of the jail.” Safire said he brought Robinson to the campaign manager, who then escorted him to see Nixon.</p> <p>“Ten minutes later, he came out, tears of frustration in his eyes,” Safire wrote. “‘He thinks calling Martin would be ‘grandstanding,’ Robinson reported. ‘Nixon doesn't deserve to win.’”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2e/1e/da486c2d46e5b02ad758943af421/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary4.png\"> <br> <p>In his autobiography, Robinson recalled: “I was in the behind-the-scenes struggle to persuade Dick Nixon to express his concern for Dr. King, but apparently his most trusted advisors were counseling him not to rock the racial boat. Add to this fact that Mr. Nixon refused to campaign in Harlem as his opponent did, and it is easy to understand why blacks overwhelmingly voted for Kennedy.”</p> <p>Despite his anger with Nixon, Robinson resisted entreaties from his wife and friends to switch sides.</p> <p>“It’s hard to explain why I stuck, disillusioned as I was,” he wrote. “It had something to do with stubbornness about continuing to want to believe in people even when everything indicates that they are no longer worthy of support.” He said he clung to the hope that Nixon would follow through on what he said at their meeting once the pressure of the campaign was over.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Nixon lost</b> and Robinson began to warm to President Kennedy after initially calling him out for a lack of progress on civil rights. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Robinson still supported a Republican, albeit a moderate one, for president in 1964 — Rockefeller, the New York governor — but this time with his eyes a bit more open.</p> <p>“I wasn’t about to be taken in instantly by the Nelson Rockefeller charm,” Robinson said. “After all, Richard Nixon had turned the charm on me too (although his is a bit more brittle compared with Rockefeller’s) and look how that had worked out.”</p> <p>And Robinson made a distinction between Rockefeller and the rest of the GOP: “I was not as sold on the Republican party as I was on the governor. Every chance I got, while I was campaigning, I said plainly what I thought of the right-wing Republicans and the harm they were doing.”</p> <p>Around this time, Robinson was also calling out Black militants such as Malcolm X, including in a November 1963 <i>Chicago Defender</i> column. Malcolm X replied in a Dec. 7 column in the same publication, addressed to “Dear Good Friend, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson”:</p> <p><i>Aren’t you the same ex-baseball player who tried to “mislead” Negroes in Nixon’s camp during the last presidential election? Evidently, you were the only Negro who voted for Nixon, because according to the polls taken afterward, very few Negroes were dumb enough to follow your “mislead.” … You never give up. You are now trying to lead Negroes into Nelson Rockefeller’s camp.</i></p> <p>Robinson went to the ’64 Republican National Convention in San Francisco as a special delegate, which he called “one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life.” Those were particularly striking words from a man who had endured death threats, hate mail and other abuse after debuting with the Dodgers in 1947.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6c/86/5e206af94660bcf7b7563ce3d720/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>“A new breed of Republican had taken over the GOP,” he wrote. “As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco, I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.”</p> <p>When he cheered on his candidate — shouting “‘C’mon, Rocky!’” — an angry Alabama delegate turned “menacingly” toward him, but the man’s wife held him back. Robinson, who early in his career was forced to turn the other check in the face of white infielders spiking him and white pitchers throwing at his head, had no such restraints now: “‘Turn him loose, lady, turn him loose!’ I shouted. I was ready for him. I wanted him badly, but luckily for him he obeyed his wife.”</p> <p>The Republicans nominated archconservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He’d also written off the Black vote, saying, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.” Robinson denounced him as a bigot and joined “Republicans for Johnson” — working to reelect Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who won in a landslide.<br></p> <br> <p><b>In 1966, Robinson went to work</b> for Rockefeller as a special assistant to the governor for community affairs, then backed him again in the 1968 presidential election, when Nixon staged a comeback. California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged both candidates from the right, and when Robinson heard about reports of a possible Rockefeller-Reagan ticket to block Nixon, he told the New York governor he could never support that.</p> <p>With a laugh, Rockefeller replied: “You should have heard the hard time I had explaining <i>you</i> to Reagan.”</p> <p>After Republicans nominated Nixon for president, Robinson said he realized that the party didn’t care about him or his people.</p> <p>“The Republican Party has told the black man to go to hell. I offer to them a similar invitation,” Robinson wrote in his “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America” column, published by the <i>Chicago Defender</i> in 1968.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a4/5c/1dbffd6040c3a367ddee72fd5a6d/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p>Still just 49, Robinson suffered a heart attack that year, and skipped the GOP convention on doctor’s orders — which he said was for the best.</p> <p>“It was a white folks affair and the once Grand Old Party’s new caretakers, under Richard Nixon, leaned over backwards to give Dixie some Southern comfort,” Robinson wrote, calling the party “insensitive and stupid” for choosing Nixon over Rockefeller.</p> <p>“They deserved the man they got — a two-time loser, an adjustable man with a convertible conscience — Richard Nixon.”</p> <p>Robinson quit his job with the Rockefeller administration and endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate, Humphrey, by now LBJ’s vice president. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1968/08/15/archives/politics-humphrey-urges-speech-limit-and-end-to-convention.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;At a joint appearance in Harlem&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1968/08/15/archives/politics-humphrey-urges-speech-limit-and-end-to-convention.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">At a joint appearance in Harlem</a>, a small group of African Americans heckled both men, one yelling “that Uncle Tom” Robinson should leave along with Humphrey.</p> <p>This time, Nixon won in a close election as the Democratic Party splintered.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Even after turning away from Nixon, </b>Robinson continued to correspond with him. In a 1970 letter republished in his autobiography, Robinson criticized the president for selecting “enemies” of the Black community as his top advisers. He singled out Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who had run for president in 1948 as a “Dixiecrat” and had played a key role at the ’68 GOP convention; Attorney General John Mitchell; and Vice President Spiro Agnew.</p> <p>“You would not support known anti-Semites to placate Jewish feelings. Why appoint known segregationists to deal with black problems?” he asked Nixon.</p> <p>Nixon replied in an anodyne note thanking Robinson for his “thoughtful letter” — the same phrase he had used in responding to the former ballplayer in 1957. “All I can hope,” the president wrote, “is that by my acts and those of the men who I have chosen to help set polices, I can earn the respect and the friendship of Black America.”</p> <p>In another letter, Robinson told Nixon he could never support his reelection as long as Agnew was on the ticket: “I feel so strongly about his being anti-black and anti-progressive in race relations that I dread the fact of anything happening to you and Mr. Agnew becoming President of the United States.”</p> <p>(Of course, Nixon did wind up resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but Agnew resigned before that, sparing the nation a President Agnew.)</p> <p>Perhaps no sentiment better captured Robinson’s disillusionment with Nixon than his March 21, 1972, letter to Nixon, after the president proposed restrictions on school busing, which was a contentious issue at the time. In a nationwide televised address, Nixon declared: “I am opposed to busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance in our schools.”</p> <p>Robinson told Nixon he was wrong to suggest Black Americans wanted busing to achieve racial balance. “We want busing so our children can compete!” he wrote, and accused the president of “polarizing this country.”</p> <p>And yet he expressed a glimmer of hope for his onetime ally.</p> <p>“Because I want so much to be a part of and to love this country as I once did,” he concluded, “I hope you will take another look at where we are going and be the president who leads the nation to accept difficult but necessary action, rather than one who fosters division.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fb/f4/e0b3d5d249c4807b17d14b9326d6/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p>In July 1972, Nixon selected Robinson as the “best all-around athlete” in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/07/01/richard-nixon-baseball-all-time-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;president’s all-time baseball list&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/07/01/richard-nixon-baseball-all-time-teams/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">president’s all-time baseball list</a>.

The Richard Nixon I met back in 1960 bore no resemblance to the Richard Nixon as President.”<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"In the summer of 1960, Jackie Robinson was one of the most prominent ex-athletes in America. He had retired after the 1956 season but was still hugely popular, having broken baseball’s color barrier 13 years earlier. And he had a decision to make: Who was he going to back in the presidential election that fall?\n Robinson’s endorsement was so valuable that both John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon personally courted him. And in turn, the baseball icon vetted each candidate, hard. As the election approached, he met with both men on the same day, a kind of job interview for his support.\n Robinson was an active supporter of the civil rights movement, and most Black Americans backed Kennedy. But Robinson had signaled early in 1960 that Democrats shouldn’t take Blacks’ support for granted. While his first choice for president had been a Democrat, civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey, Robinson made it clear that he was intrigued by Nixon as well.\n “Though the Democratic nominee is still undetermined at this point, it would be folly to underestimate the impression Nixon’s generally good civil rights record has made among Negroes,” Robinson wrote in a column published in the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper, in January 1960. “I’ve been following Nixon’s career for some time now, and I don’t mind admitting that generally I’ve liked what I’ve seen and heard.”\n Robinson added that while Nixon’s record wasn’t as good as Humphrey’s, it was still “very attractive” compared to other Democratic candidates. “Many people whom I’ve talked with, whose first concern is civil rights, would not hesitate to support Vice President Nixon.”\n Robinson recognized that liberals disliked Nixon for how he had trashed his Democratic opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in his victorious 1950 Senate election. And, as he acknowledged in his autobiography, I Never Had It Made\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70dd0001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">I Never Had It Made, “there was a great deal of suspicion in the black community about Nixon.” But he defended the vice president, writing that “in the years he’s been prominent in national affairs, Mr. Nixon has grown more than any other person presently in political life.”\n At the time, the parties were not as ideologically uniform as they are today — there were liberal Republicans and Democratic segregationists. And Robinson wasn’t ready to commit to Democrats if they didn’t nominate Humphrey, which they didn’t, leaving Robinson with a tough choice: Pick an untested Democrat or openly flout the preference of the Black community and support the Republican.\n \n  \n So, a few weeks before the mid-July Democratic National Convention, Robinson had his doubleheader of meetings with Nixon and Kennedy.\n In Nixon’s office, the vice president “said all the right things,” Robinson recalled in his autobiography. However, he was put off when he heard Nixon take a call and say, “No, well, I can’t do that. I’m tired of pulling his chestnuts out of this fire. He’ll have to work his own way out of this one.” After hanging up, Nixon told Robinson he had been talking about President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “It sounded as if the Vice President wanted me to disassociate him from Eisenhower since he knew that blacks, in the main, didn’t like Ike,” Robinson wrote. “It had the feel of a cheap trick.”\n But he had a much worse impression of Kennedy, whom he met with at a private home in Washington later that day.\n “My very first reaction to the Senator was one of doubt because he couldn’t or wouldn’t look me straight in the eye,” Robinson recalled, and he wound up writing a letter to JFK suggesting he do so in the future.\n “My second reaction, much more substantial, was that this was a man who had served in the Senate and wanted to be President but who knew little or nothing about black problems and sensibilities. He himself admitted a lack of any depth of understanding about black people … I was appalled that he could be so ignorant of our situation and be bidding for the highest office in the land.”\n That did it. Jackie Robinson chose Richard Nixon.\n \n He told the leaders at Washington’s African Methodist Church that he asked the same questions of both candidates, and while Nixon gave straightforward answers, “I had to challenge Kennedy six times.”\n Robinson’s decision to support Nixon was controversial. It earned him the enmity of some Black leaders, including Malcolm X, but Robinson didn’t waver. Later, he would even support another Republican for president, moderate Nelson Rockefeller.\n “That was a pretty gutsy thing for him to do, considering the entire black establishment was behind John F. Kennedy, but Jackie Robinson had unique experience in breaking through in the white world,” recalled William Safire, a young Nixon aide at the time. “The athlete with the greatest positive influence on black-white relations since the boxer Joe Louis was not the sort to flinch at being called an Uncle Tom for supporting a Republican.”\n It was also a decision Robinson came to regret.\n In the coming years, he became disillusioned not just with Nixon, but with the Republican Party. The GOP had moved steadily to the right through the turbulent 1960s, embracing a strategy of pandering to Southern whites that threatened civil rights gains spearheaded by the Democrats. When Nixon sought the presidency again eight years later, Robinson denounced him in a column headlined, “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America.” Robinson would die in 1972, half a century before the reactionary forces he saw emerging ultimately came to dominate the GOP.\n \n The relationship between Nixon and Robinson dated back to 1952, when Robinson was a star player in his prime and Nixon was a U.S. senator running as Eisenhower’s vice presidential running mate, on their way to winning the White House.\n Nixon was a huge sports fan and something of a fanboy, and had a hard time curbing his enthusiasm when he met Robinson at that year’s Republican National Convention in Chicago. According to Harrison McCall, president of the California Republican Assembly, who introduced the two men, Nixon told Robinson about first seeing him compete in a UCLA football game in 1939 — and about a specific play that stood out all these years later.\n “I said to Nixon as we walked away that, while Robinson had undoubtedly met a lot of notables in his career, nevertheless I was sure there was one person he would never forget,” McCall said.\n Nixon also watched Robinson play for the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field, including the World Series that fall, which the New York Yankees won in seven games. The two men were around the same age — Nixon was born six years earlier, in 1913 — and they both grew up in California, although under far different circumstances.\n \n  \n By 1957, a year after Robinson retired, he was praising Nixon for a speech in Ethiopia in which the vice president declared that the U.S. will never be satisfied until all Americans have equal opportunity. “In this endeavor,” Robinson wrote in one of many letters to Nixon, “you have my best wishes and steadfast cooperation.”\n “Dear Jackie,” Nixon replied. “As you can imagine, there were a number of letters on my desk when I returned to the office today after an absence of three weeks. I can assure you, however, that there were none which meant more to me than your thoughtful letter of March 19.” He called it a “privilege” to be working with Robinson “to achieve the important objective of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all Americans, and your expression of approval will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to me.”\n \n So Nixon had built up a groundswell of goodwill with Robinson in the years leading up to the 1960 election. But he soon squandered it.\n A key incident took place in October 1960, when Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed in Georgia. Nixon sat on his hands while the Kennedy campaign acted decisively. JFK called King’s wife, Coretta, to express support, and worked behind the scenes to press for King’s release. After he was freed, King publicly thanked JFK for his role and pointedly said he hadn’t heard from Nixon.\n At the Nixon campaign, Robinson had pushed for a robust response from his candidate.\n “He has to do this,” Robinson said at the time, according to a 1987 Safire column in the New York Times. “He has to call Martin right now, today. I have the number of the jail.” Safire said he brought Robinson to the campaign manager, who then escorted him to see Nixon.\n “Ten minutes later, he came out, tears of frustration in his eyes,” Safire wrote. “‘He thinks calling Martin would be ‘grandstanding,’ Robinson reported. ‘Nixon doesn't deserve to win.’”\n \n  \n In his autobiography, Robinson recalled: “I was in the behind-the-scenes struggle to persuade Dick Nixon to express his concern for Dr. King, but apparently his most trusted advisors were counseling him not to rock the racial boat. Add to this fact that Mr. Nixon refused to campaign in Harlem as his opponent did, and it is easy to understand why blacks overwhelmingly voted for Kennedy.”\n Despite his anger with Nixon, Robinson resisted entreaties from his wife and friends to switch sides.\n “It’s hard to explain why I stuck, disillusioned as I was,” he wrote. “It had something to do with stubbornness about continuing to want to believe in people even when everything indicates that they are no longer worthy of support.” He said he clung to the hope that Nixon would follow through on what he said at their meeting once the pressure of the campaign was over.\n \n Nixon lost and Robinson began to warm to President Kennedy after initially calling him out for a lack of progress on civil rights. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Robinson still supported a Republican, albeit a moderate one, for president in 1964 — Rockefeller, the New York governor — but this time with his eyes a bit more open.\n “I wasn’t about to be taken in instantly by the Nelson Rockefeller charm,” Robinson said. “After all, Richard Nixon had turned the charm on me too (although his is a bit more brittle compared with Rockefeller’s) and look how that had worked out.”\n And Robinson made a distinction between Rockefeller and the rest of the GOP: “I was not as sold on the Republican party as I was on the governor. Every chance I got, while I was campaigning, I said plainly what I thought of the right-wing Republicans and the harm they were doing.”\n Around this time, Robinson was also calling out Black militants such as Malcolm X, including in a November 1963 Chicago Defender column. Malcolm X replied in a Dec. 7 column in the same publication, addressed to “Dear Good Friend, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson”:\n Aren’t you the same ex-baseball player who tried to “mislead” Negroes in Nixon’s camp during the last presidential election? Evidently, you were the only Negro who voted for Nixon, because according to the polls taken afterward, very few Negroes were dumb enough to follow your “mislead.” … You never give up. You are now trying to lead Negroes into Nelson Rockefeller’s camp.\n Robinson went to the ’64 Republican National Convention in San Francisco as a special delegate, which he called “one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life.” Those were particularly striking words from a man who had endured death threats, hate mail and other abuse after debuting with the Dodgers in 1947.\n \n  \n “A new breed of Republican had taken over the GOP,” he wrote. “As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco, I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.”\n When he cheered on his candidate — shouting “‘C’mon, Rocky!’” — an angry Alabama delegate turned “menacingly” toward him, but the man’s wife held him back. Robinson, who early in his career was forced to turn the other check in the face of white infielders spiking him and white pitchers throwing at his head, had no such restraints now: “‘Turn him loose, lady, turn him loose!’ I shouted. I was ready for him. I wanted him badly, but luckily for him he obeyed his wife.”\n The Republicans nominated archconservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He’d also written off the Black vote, saying, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.” Robinson denounced him as a bigot and joined “Republicans for Johnson” — working to reelect Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who won in a landslide.\n \n In 1966, Robinson went to work for Rockefeller as a special assistant to the governor for community affairs, then backed him again in the 1968 presidential election, when Nixon staged a comeback. California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged both candidates from the right, and when Robinson heard about reports of a possible Rockefeller-Reagan ticket to block Nixon, he told the New York governor he could never support that.\n With a laugh, Rockefeller replied: “You should have heard the hard time I had explaining you to Reagan.”\n After Republicans nominated Nixon for president, Robinson said he realized that the party didn’t care about him or his people.\n “The Republican Party has told the black man to go to hell. I offer to them a similar invitation,” Robinson wrote in his “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America” column, published by the Chicago Defender in 1968.\n \n  \n Still just 49, Robinson suffered a heart attack that year, and skipped the GOP convention on doctor’s orders — which he said was for the best.\n “It was a white folks affair and the once Grand Old Party’s new caretakers, under Richard Nixon, leaned over backwards to give Dixie some Southern comfort,” Robinson wrote, calling the party “insensitive and stupid” for choosing Nixon over Rockefeller.\n “They deserved the man they got — a two-time loser, an adjustable man with a convertible conscience — Richard Nixon.”\n Robinson quit his job with the Rockefeller administration and endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate, Humphrey, by now LBJ’s vice president. At a joint appearance in Harlem, a small group of African Americans heckled both men, one yelling “that Uncle Tom” Robinson should leave along with Humphrey.\n This time, Nixon won in a close election as the Democratic Party splintered.\n \n Even after turning away from Nixon, Robinson continued to correspond with him. In a 1970 letter republished in his autobiography, Robinson criticized the president for selecting “enemies” of the Black community as his top advisers. He singled out Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who had run for president in 1948 as a “Dixiecrat” and had played a key role at the ’68 GOP convention; Attorney General John Mitchell; and Vice President Spiro Agnew.\n “You would not support known anti-Semites to placate Jewish feelings. Why appoint known segregationists to deal with black problems?” he asked Nixon.\n Nixon replied in an anodyne note thanking Robinson for his “thoughtful letter” — the same phrase he had used in responding to the former ballplayer in 1957. “All I can hope,” the president wrote, “is that by my acts and those of the men who I have chosen to help set polices, I can earn the respect and the friendship of Black America.”\n In another letter, Robinson told Nixon he could never support his reelection as long as Agnew was on the ticket: “I feel so strongly about his being anti-black and anti-progressive in race relations that I dread the fact of anything happening to you and Mr. Agnew becoming President of the United States.”\n (Of course, Nixon did wind up resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but Agnew resigned before that, sparing the nation a President Agnew.)\n Perhaps no sentiment better captured Robinson’s disillusionment with Nixon than his March 21, 1972, letter to Nixon, after the president proposed restrictions on school busing, which was a contentious issue at the time. In a nationwide televised address, Nixon declared: “I am opposed to busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance in our schools.”\n Robinson told Nixon he was wrong to suggest Black Americans wanted busing to achieve racial balance. “We want busing so our children can compete!” he wrote, and accused the president of “polarizing this country.”\n And yet he expressed a glimmer of hope for his onetime ally.\n “Because I want so much to be a part of and to love this country as I once did,” he concluded, “I hope you will take another look at where we are going and be the president who leads the nation to accept difficult but necessary action, rather than one who fosters division.”\n \n  \n In July 1972, Nixon selected Robinson as the “best all-around athlete” in the president’s all-time baseball list. Initially, Robinson said, “I’m honored that he thought of me that way.” But a week later, he had reconsidered, saying, “I mean, how many games has Nixon actually seen?” Robinson surely knew that Nixon had seen quite a few games, but his comment showed how much contempt he had for the president by then.\n Still, Nixon continued to praise Robinson, perhaps in an effort to try to associate himself with a beloved national figure.\n On Oct. 15, 1972, just nine days before Robinson’s death, Major League Baseball honored him at a World Series event commemorating the 25th anniversary of him breaking the color barrier. Robinson, suffering from diabetes and blind in one eye, used the occasion to challenge baseball owners to hire a Black manager. Nixon sent a telegram that was read aloud by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn.\n “Baseball has known many moments of greatness in its long history,” Nixon wrote. “But none have been as significant or compelling as that April 15 afternoon, 25 years ago, when Jackie Robinson and eight other Dodgers took the field for his appearance at first base.”\n Robinson died on Oct. 24, 1972, at the age of 53. The White House sent a 40-person delegation to Robinson’s memorial service in New York three days later, but the president did not attend himself.\n Robinson ultimately got the final word on their relationship in his autobiography I Never Had It Made\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0008\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70de0009\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">I Never Had It Made, which was published soon after his death as Nixon was cruising to a landslide reelection victory.\n “I do not consider my decision to back Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy for the presidency in 1960 one of my finest ones,” Robinson wrote. “It was a sincere one, however, at the time. The Richard Nixon I met back in 1960 bore no resemblance to the Richard Nixon as President.”","dc:creator":"Frederic J.

The movie is filled with chilling scenes, mostly due to the fact that the identity of the killer is unknown, and every character is at-risk throughout the entirety of the film.</p> <p>The movie is based off the murders committed by the Zodiac Killer and was made using two books \"Zodiac\" and \"Zodiac Unmasked\" written by Robert Graysmith, the character Gyllenhaal plays in the movie. David Fincher's \"Zodiac\" is often praised by law enforcement, reporters and the public for how accurate it was in its telling of the tale.</p> <p>The serial killer would tease authorities by sending them coded messages via newspaper articles. These letters remained a mystery for many years, but in 2021, his final two notes were decoded and revealed he was killing people in order to build an army of slaves for his afterlife. </p> <p>Just like in the film, the killer's preferred method used to carry out the killings was not always the same, and he didn't have consistent modus operandi. He got the moniker of Zodiac Killer because that is how he would sign the letters he wrote to the newspapers.</p> <p>There were not many suspects at the time, and the movie primarily focused on one, Arthur Leigh Allen, who seemed a likely candidate. He died in 1992, and 10 years later it was revealed his DNA did not match those found on envelopes the killer sent newspapers. Other suspects included Joseph \"Giuseppe\" Bevilacqua, Gary Francis Poste and Richard Gaikowski, but the killer's identity is still unknown.</p> <p>The 1979 paranormal horror movie is based off a real house in which a horrendous crime took place, followed by some very confusing paranormal activity. The real crime took place five years prior to the movie's release in 1974 in a house in a small Long Island town Amityville. </p> <p>In November 1974, 23-year-old Ronald J. DeFeo Jr. killed his entire family, including his parents and four siblings while they were asleep in their beds. He was caught and was convicted of six sentences of 25 years to life to be served at Sullivan Correctional Facility in the town of Fallsburg, New York, where he stayed until his death in March 2021 at Albany Medical Center.</p> <p>According to Biography.com, just as in the movie, a new family moved into the home where the murders took place, only a year after the killings. The Lutz family only lived there for 28 days however, due to experiencing a number of paranormal horrors in the house.

Blatty also wrote the screenplay for the movie.</p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Doe asked his aunt for a Ouji Board for his birthday, and after she died, he began to experience unexplainable things around the house, like rattlings on the walls, strange noises, and flying objects, something the movie also portrays. According to Screen Rant, after trying multiple different outlets, his family asked a priest to perform an exorcism. His first attempt was cut short after Doe began throwing things at the priest.</p> <p>The family then traveled to Saint Louis University – after the word \"louis\" appeared on Doe's body -- where two other priests performed exorcisms on him. It is unknown what happened after this point, but many believe the boy is actually Ronald Hunkeler, who grew up to be a NASA engineer who worked on the moon landing. </p> <p>Some details are changed in the film. In the film, the possessed child is a 12-year-old girl living with a single mother who started experiencing violent outbursts, which Doe was never confirmed to have.

In 1961, residents of Capitola, California woke up to find birds crashing into their homes and cars and throwing up half digested food onto wherever they landed.</p> <p>They didn't know it at the time, but the reason for the bird's unusual behavior was poisoning from toxic algae they had eaten. </p>","content:encodedSnippet":"The first horror movies in recorded history, \"House of the Devil,\" \"A Terrible Night\" and \"A Nightmare\" were made in 1896 by Georges Méliès and ranged from just over a minute to just over three minutes long.\n While maybe not the most popular genre at the time, it has since grown in popularity, with films like \"The Exorcist,\" \"Carrie,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"It,\" \"The Thing,\" \"Silence of the Lambs\" and many others garnering critical acclaim, the last of which earning Academy Award wins for its lead actor and actress.\n While these movies are often seen as disturbing, what makes some horror movies even more uncomfortable to watch is knowing they are based on, or inspired by, a true story. \n Here are some horror movies based on, or inspired partly, by true stories.\n 9 HALLOWEEN MOVIES TO STREAM\n Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a reporter investigating a series of murders in San Francisco between 1968 and 1969. The movie is filled with chilling scenes, mostly due to the fact that the identity of the killer is unknown, and every character is at-risk throughout the entirety of the film.\n The movie is based off the murders committed by the Zodiac Killer and was made using two books \"Zodiac\" and \"Zodiac Unmasked\" written by Robert Graysmith, the character Gyllenhaal plays in the movie. David Fincher's \"Zodiac\" is often praised by law enforcement, reporters and the public for how accurate it was in its telling of the tale.\n The serial killer would tease authorities by sending them coded messages via newspaper articles. These letters remained a mystery for many years, but in 2021, his final two notes were decoded and revealed he was killing people in order to build an army of slaves for his afterlife. \n Just like in the film, the killer's preferred method used to carry out the killings was not always the same, and he didn't have consistent modus operandi. He got the moniker of Zodiac Killer because that is how he would sign the letters he wrote to the newspapers.\n There were not many suspects at the time, and the movie primarily focused on one, Arthur Leigh Allen, who seemed a likely candidate. He died in 1992, and 10 years later it was revealed his DNA did not match those found on envelopes the killer sent newspapers. Other suspects included Joseph \"Giuseppe\" Bevilacqua, Gary Francis Poste and Richard Gaikowski, but the killer's identity is still unknown.\n The 1979 paranormal horror movie is based off a real house in which a horrendous crime took place, followed by some very confusing paranormal activity. The real crime took place five years prior to the movie's release in 1974 in a house in a small Long Island town Amityville. \n In November 1974, 23-year-old Ronald J. DeFeo Jr. killed his entire family, including his parents and four siblings while they were asleep in their beds. He was caught and was convicted of six sentences of 25 years to life to be served at Sullivan Correctional Facility in the town of Fallsburg, New York, where he stayed until his death in March 2021 at Albany Medical Center.\n According to Biography.com, just as in the movie, a new family moved into the home where the murders took place, only a year after the killings. The Lutz family only lived there for 28 days however, due to experiencing a number of paranormal horrors in the house. The family claimed to have smelled strange smells, sensed cold spots in certain areas of the house and saw green slime coming out of the walls.\n Patriarch George Lutz claimed to have woken up every night at 3:15 a.m., which was when the murders were said to have been committed, and when a priest came over to cleanse the house, he claimed to have heard a spirit yelling at him to get out. The family also claimed they saw the matriarch, Kathy, levitating and a pig-like creature with red eyes staring straight through a window at George and his son.\n There are rumors that the family made up these stories to earn money, as they were going through financial hardships at the time. However, when given a lie detector test to give credibility to the claims, both Kathy and George passed.\n When \"The Conjuring\" was released in 2013, it was easy for audiences to pass it off as yet another horror story based in fiction, but what they did not know is that it was based off a real family, and the demon hunting husband and wife duo who helped them.

No way.” She railed against “radical leftists” and the media – “those lying, propagandist bastards who are trying to bring this country down.”</p> <p>At one point, a man in the crowd called out, “We’ve got your six, Kari.”</p> <p>“Thank you, sir,” Lake replied. “Thank you, cowboy.”</p> <p>She said, “We have God on our side,” and she asked her supporters to raise their hands if they were “ready to vote like your lives depend on it.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/5d/ae/c83e8da54a9eb4498fad8109e928/siderslessecondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p><br></p> <br> <p><b>In Arizona, </b>violence hasn’t been just rhetorical.

Next to Lake on a debate stage, Hobbs would likely seem smaller — with the way she draws her elbows in when she addresses a crowd, and with a voice that does not fill the air like Lake’s. There would probably be a clip the next morning of Lake belittling her.</p> <p>But it didn’t strike me that Hobbs could not <i>survive</i> the encounter. She took questions from reporters at a handful of events I attended over the weekend in and around Phoenix, then took follow-up questions and, when I asked her campaign to talk to her once more, made her available again. She had one well-practiced applause line, referring to Lake as “the Trump-endorsed, election-denying, media-hating, conspiracy-loving GOP nominee.”</p> <p>At El Portal, Garrido Wilcox’s husband, Earl Wilcox, a former Arizona state lawmaker and former aide to former Gov. Janet Napolitano, said he understood Hobbs’ decision not to give Lake the platform of a debate. But he said, “We want her to be stronger … I would like for her to be more forceful, show some passion.”</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2f/70/ed345d2d48c2bb9b53502d896370/siderslessecondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p> Hobbs told me that, politically speaking, Lake is “not a bad candidate … She’s doing that Donald Trump model, where we do all these rallies and get everyone excited.”</p> <p>She said she always expected the race to be close and that her campaign is “very focused on what we have to do … to make sure that we are on the right side of that tight race.”</p> <p>Her critics, she said, are “getting caught up in the noise.”</p> <p>She said, “I know that people are worried because this race is so close, and there’s so much at stake, and it’s easy to get caught up in the ‘You’re not doing everything possible.’”</p> <p>She said, “We are.”</p> <p>Still, Steven Slugocki, a former Democratic Party chair in Maricopa County, the state’s population hub, told me Democrats are already discussing how to respond to “the chaos we could see over the next two years if [Lake, Finchem and Hamadeh] get elected,” anticipating if they win, that Democrats will be in court litigating over <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-suggests-early-voting-restricted-arizona-repeats/story?id=91920284\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Republican-led efforts to limit early voting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-suggests-early-voting-restricted-arizona-repeats/story?id=91920284&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b715f0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b715f0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Republican-led efforts to limit early voting</a> and otherwise make voting more restrictive.</p> <p>“It’s going to be a nonstop grind,” he said.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/44/4a/091206ca4f97bb1b78b00ab04393/siderslessecondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p><b>In 2020, </b>it was a Republican governor, Ducey, who <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/12/02/arizona-gov-doug-ducey-confirms-trump-called-during-vote-certification/3802735001/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666823016868,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf0a-d5ef-ad97-bf7f0c940006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666823016868,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf0a-d5ef-ad97-bf7f0c940006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/12/02/arizona-gov-doug-ducey-confirms-trump-called-during-vote-certification/3802735001/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-1660-d9f5-a1e6-9e7242b40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;silenced a telephone call&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-1660-d9f5-a1e6-9e7242b40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">silenced a telephone call</a> from Trump while signing papers certifying the election, the ringtone “Hail to the Chief” sounding on his phone.

Everyone was.</p> <p>“You feeling good?” said John Rich, the country singer who played after Lake spoke, and who described her as “like a well-spoken Arizona rattlesnake.” “You feel like you’re going to win?”</p> <p>The crowd roared, the smell of barbecue and kettle corn in the air.</p> <p><i>Steven Shepard contributed to this report&nbsp;</i><br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"MORRISTOWN, Ariz. — On a stage backed up to a rodeo ring between a barbecue restaurant and a petting zoo, dusk fell over the Arizona desert and several thousand Kari Lake supporters fell into prayer for Lake, the Republican nominee for governor, for “the army of patriots that you are raising up in this hour” and, ultimately, for a “divine turnaround” in Arizona.\n The event was a rally for Lake, and following the supporter who said the prayer, Austin Smith, a Republican state House candidate, told rallygoers they were “chosen” — a state of “pioneers, ranchers, working-class families” in conflict with forces of a “global world order.”\n “We want to make sure that Arizona is the Wild West, right?” he asked.\n \n  \n With their Lake flags and buckets of beer, the crowd erupted. The opening lines of AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” blared and Lake strode on stage.\n Two years ago, the current occupant of the office Lake is seeking, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, had certified Joe Biden’s victory, the first for a Democratic presidential candidate in the state since 1996, infuriating then-President Donald Trump and his supporters. The Republican state House speaker, Rusty Bowers, also resisted Trump’s pressure campaign, then testified before the Jan. 6 committee about it. Katie Hobbs, the Democratic secretary of state and, now, Lake’s opponent in the gubernatorial race, had overseen the election.\n If there is a center in American politics, in Arizona in 2020, that center held. But as I watched Lake take the stage, it wasn’t clear to me that it still would.\n Lake, a former TV anchor and one of the GOP’s most prominent election deniers, has said that unlike Ducey, she would not have certified the 2020 election. When she was asked earlier this month if she would accept the results of her own upcoming race, she replied, “I’m going to win the election, and I will accept that result.” Separately, she said she would accept the result “if we have a fair, honest and transparent election,” as though the integrity of the election was in any doubt.\n \n  \n \nIn recent polling, she has pulled slightly ahead of Hobbs.\n Meanwhile, Blake Masters, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate who denied the results of the 2020 election while more recently calling Biden the “legitimate president,” has been gaining ground in his run against Sen. Mark Kelly, while state Rep. Mark Finchem, a celebrity in election conspiracy circles, and Abe Hamadeh, a fellow election denier, have credible chances of becoming secretary of state and attorney general, respectively.\n It isn’t hard to see what that might mean for the next presidential election, in 2024. Looking around the state, false claims about the last election are already clouding the present one. Last week, with early voting in Arizona underway, two armed, masked men in tactical gear were seen observing a ballot drop box in Mesa, outside Phoenix. Elections officials were beginning to field complaints of potential voter intimidation, while law enforcement officials said they were stepping up security around drop box sites.\n “Craaaaazies,” Barrett Marson, a Republican political strategist in the state, told me when I asked him about the drop box observers in masks.\n But the whole state, he said, is “crazy.”\n \n  \n “There’s no doubt about that,” he said. “It’s going to be a long two years.”\n  To Lake, the campaign was something different. She called it all — the rally this past Saturday night, her rise in Arizona — the start of a “huge red wave.” And the frisson of excitement in the crowd, the combative rhetoric and the brutal imagery surrounding it suggested a real war at hand.\n In the parking lot at the ranch northwest of Phoenix where Lake addressed the crowd, amid palo verde trees, Tony Boulos, who was selling T-shirts, showed me one of his best sellers. It said, “It’s Time to Take Biden to the Train Station,” a reference to the remote location where dead bodies are disposed of in the TV show “Yellowstone.”\n “The conservatives, they aren’t troublemakers,” he said, pointing to the line of people streaming in. “They’ve just had it.”\n He was selling ammunition, too. “It’s Arizona, man!” Boulos said.\n A colleague of his turned a hot dog on a grill and told me, “Our state’s a hot point right now,” while inside on the microphone, Lake said she felt “like I’m on the road like a rock star, performing.” She called Hobbs a “coward,” while describing her own campaign as a “national movement … originating here in Arizona.” She lamented the state of immigration, homelessness and the economy under Democratic rule, and, shaking her finger, pledged that “we’re not letting them take this election like [Biden] did. No way.” She railed against “radical leftists” and the media – “those lying, propagandist bastards who are trying to bring this country down.”\n At one point, a man in the crowd called out, “We’ve got your six, Kari.”\n “Thank you, sir,” Lake replied. “Thank you, cowboy.”\n She said, “We have God on our side,” and she asked her supporters to raise their hands if they were “ready to vote like your lives depend on it.”\n \n  \n \n \n In Arizona, violence hasn’t been just rhetorical. In 2011, then-Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting outside of Tucson. Fourteen years before that, Mary Rose Garrido Wilcox, then a member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, was shot in the pelvis by a man who disagreed with her politics.\n On the day of the Lake rally, while Hobbs was talking with supporters at El Portal, the restaurant Garrido Wilcox owns in Phoenix. I asked Garrido Wilcox how the political climate in Arizona today compares to then.\n “It’s scarier now,” she said.\n Garrido Wilcox, a Democrat, is optimistic about her party’s prospects in next month’s elections. But Democrats here can read headlines just as well as anyone, and it’s become obvious that Lake is on a tear.\n In fact, to read some of the coverage – “Kari Lake and the Power of a Polished MAGA Message,” or “Why Kari Lake Is the Next Republican Star” – the election is already over. Lake, amid speculation that she could be a presidential or vice presidential contender, recently pledged to “serve eight years” as governor.\n “Kari,” one Democratic strategist texted me, “is going to be president at this rate.”\n \n  \n Part of the problem for Democrats is Lake’s appeal. Then there’s the midterm election climate, which is unfavorable for Democrats everywhere. Biden only won Arizona by about 10,000 votes. But the other thing making some Democrats uncomfortable is Hobbs, who by her own admission is not as “polished” as Lake, who refuses to debate and who strategists inside and outside of Arizona had privately been expressing concerns about all summer.\n When I asked one of them in the state to explain to me why he asked if I’d heard her speak.\n I’d seen the clip of Hobbs, at a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce forum, fumbling to answer a question about what she’d learned from the Latino community (her answer included mentioning “practicing my español … un poquito”), and there was the clip of her spilling her drink at a restaurant when, approached by a member of the conservative group Project Veritas, she moved quickly to get away. For her opponents, her unwillingness to debate was an opportunity to tie all of that up into one, broad hit on her as, as Lake puts it, a “coward.”\n At Lake’s rally, a supporter in a “Where’s Waldo” costume danced in the crowd holding a “Where’s Katie?” sign. Laurie Roberts, a columnist for the Arizona Republic, wrote that Hobbs’ debate avoidance was a “new level of political malpractice.” On CNN, Bakari Sellers, the Democratic TV pundit and former South Carolina state lawmaker, called it a “terrible decision.” And whether it was or not, it was the last thing Hobbs’ campaign wanted to be on voters’ minds in the closing weeks of the race.\n Hobbs had overseen one of the most contentious elections in American history in one of the most bitterly divided states – enduring death threats and protesters outside her home. And here she had allowed Lake to portray her as afraid.\n In an interview, Hobbs told me it was the “right decision” not to debate, dismissing the criticism as “noise.”\n \n  \n \n“I’m running against someone who has made it her entire platform to essentially dismantle democracy, and somehow the problem is that I don’t want to give her a stage to do that?” she asked.\n Lake, she said, is “only interested in a spectacle,” and “there’s really no upside to giving her that opportunity to turn this debate into that kind of spectacle.”\n It probably wouldn’t have been a winning night for Hobbs. Next to Lake on a debate stage, Hobbs would likely seem smaller — with the way she draws her elbows in when she addresses a crowd, and with a voice that does not fill the air like Lake’s. There would probably be a clip the next morning of Lake belittling her.\n But it didn’t strike me that Hobbs could not survive the encounter. She took questions from reporters at a handful of events I attended over the weekend in and around Phoenix, then took follow-up questions and, when I asked her campaign to talk to her once more, made her available again. She had one well-practiced applause line, referring to Lake as “the Trump-endorsed, election-denying, media-hating, conspiracy-loving GOP nominee.”\n At El Portal, Garrido Wilcox’s husband, Earl Wilcox, a former Arizona state lawmaker and former aide to former Gov. Janet Napolitano, said he understood Hobbs’ decision not to give Lake the platform of a debate. But he said, “We want her to be stronger … I would like for her to be more forceful, show some passion.”\n   \n  Hobbs told me that, politically speaking, Lake is “not a bad candidate … She’s doing that Donald Trump model, where we do all these rallies and get everyone excited.”\n She said she always expected the race to be close and that her campaign is “very focused on what we have to do … to make sure that we are on the right side of that tight race.”\n Her critics, she said, are “getting caught up in the noise.”\n She said, “I know that people are worried because this race is so close, and there’s so much at stake, and it’s easy to get caught up in the ‘You’re not doing everything possible.’”\n She said, “We are.”\n Still, Steven Slugocki, a former Democratic Party chair in Maricopa County, the state’s population hub, told me Democrats are already discussing how to respond to “the chaos we could see over the next two years if [Lake, Finchem and Hamadeh] get elected,” anticipating if they win, that Democrats will be in court litigating over Republican-led efforts to limit early voting and otherwise make voting more restrictive.\n “It’s going to be a nonstop grind,” he said.\n \n  \n In 2020, it was a Republican governor, Ducey, who silenced a telephone call from Trump while signing papers certifying the election, the ringtone “Hail to the Chief” sounding on his phone. And when he opposed Lake in the Republican primary — supporting, along with former Vice President Mike Pence, a more traditionalist Republican, Karrin Taylor Robson – Lake’s election denialism seemed to matter to him. He cast Lake as a “fake” and said she was “misleading voters with no evidence” about the result of the election.\n But all of that changed once Lake became the Republican nominee. Ducey, who had been censured by the state Republican Party for his disloyalty to Trump, told the Arizona Republic he “just reject[s]” discussion “about democracy being fragile.”\n Lake is the “superior candidate,” he said.\n And Ducey isn’t the only establishment-minded Republican who is feeling differently about Lake now than before. On the day after the primary, Bill Gates, the Republican chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, told me “the election last night was a catastrophe for the Arizona Republican Party and, I would argue, our democracy.”\n But when I spoke with him this week, Gates said he was at least holding out the possibility that Lake, if elected, “once she’s in the chair, is going to certify the results of an election as they are.”\n “I don’t know that,” he said. “I’m just saying I’m hoping. I have hope for that.”\n \n  \n Lots of Republicans do. Stan Barnes, a former state lawmaker and Republican consultant in Arizona, told me “all the noise around the democracy being threatened is, I believe, heaped upon us and exaggerated beyond belief to serve one political party that has nothing else to talk about this election cycle.”\n Lake, he said, would be “bolder and far more candid than traditional governors,” but from a policy perspective would likely be “very mainstream Republican.”\n If that sounds like what many Republicans said about Trump in the run-up to his election in 2016 or even his defeat in 2020 – when they suggested Trump was saying things he didn’t mean or wouldn’t do — it is. Even Bowers, who lost his primary earlier this year to a Trump-backed challenger who said the devil was at work in the 2020 outcome, told me he has no opinion about whether Lake would be a good governor and didn’t know if he would vote for her.\n “She’s been very vocal about the steal,” he said. “But there’s a lot that a governor does that is not about a steal.”\n But for many Republicans in Arizona, it is still very much about the 2020 election.\n The night before Lake’s rally, I drove to the site of a ballot drop box in Mesa where two sheriff’s deputies were measuring the distance between the box and a spot in the parking lot where a 59-year-old woman and her son (“I came for the free food,” he said,) were eating popcorn and Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers. From her blue camp chair, the mother watched the ballot box.\n   \n “It’s just about the ‘2,000 Mules’ movie,” said the woman, who identified herself only as Andrea, referring to the widely discredited film about 2020 election fraud. “Did you see that? That’s bad stuff!”\n Andrea said she wasn’t sure the election was rigged, but she thought it was “unfair” and that people “don’t like being lied to.” The 2020 election, she said, at least got Republicans more involved in Arizona politics.\n “I think the fact that people are paying attention, they kind of woke us up,” she said.\n She described her presence as a deterrent to would-be-cheaters, and she waved amicably at a voter in a compact car who, after dropping his ballot, left with his middle finger up for her.\n “I think Republicans sat back and let things happen,” she said of 2020. “They didn’t want to get too involved.”\n Now, she said, “It’s like, we have to fight to get this back.”\n The next evening, at the Lake rally, that same fervor ran through the crowd. One man holding a large Lake flag told me he was “attracted to a politician who doesn’t bend over and take it in the ass,” while another predicted Lake will win “as long as we can keep the cheating down.” \n \n  \n He was confident they could. Everyone was.\n “You feeling good?” said John Rich, the country singer who played after Lake spoke, and who described her as “like a well-spoken Arizona rattlesnake.” “You feel like you’re going to win?”\n The crowd roared, the smell of barbecue and kettle corn in the air.\n Steven Shepard contributed to this report","dc:creator":"David Siders","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/d1/2d/4f069a3447b2be90f566d0bf39c0/siderslede.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Photos by David Siders/POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"A Donald Trump supporter grills sausages at the rodeo rally for the Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake on Oct. 22, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/d1/2d/4f069a3447b2be90f566d0bf39c0/siderslede.jpg"}}]},"content":"Arizona resisted election denialism in 2020.

She also joined a lawsuit intended to force then-Vice President Mike Pence’s hand as he resisted pressure from Trump to single-handedly derail Joe Biden’s election.\n Ward and others on the pro-Trump elector slate were among those who received grand jury subpoenas from federal prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. Ward indicated in a recent court filing that the Justice Department has not taken any steps to enforce those subpoenas in recent months.\n Ward also asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in an appearance before the Jan. 6 select committee, a fact that the appeals court panel majority noted could be held against her in the civil lawsuit she brought to block the subpoena.","dc:creator":"Kyle Cheney, Nicholas Wu and Josh Gerstein","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/d5/a6/8b5de3a34bf6bf40994539db62b5/arizona-republicans-21544.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Ross D.

I’d picked up a Culver’s coffee for her on my way because I felt sheepish: Kari Walker deals with reporters every time an election rolls around, because she happens to own a bar and restaurant in the politically swingiest county in one of the politically swingiest states in the country, and it’s one that tends to pick winners.</p> <p>Everybody, she says, wants to know what “secret sauce” accounts for Sauk County’s uncanny record, including voting for the victor in 10 of the last 11 presidential elections; it’s one of only two counties in the state that swung from Obama to Trump and then back to Biden, and Reedsburg itself had gone with the winning candidates in Wisconsin governors’ and Senate races dating back to 2010. “I’ve been on the TV in France,” she’d told me on the phone the night before.

You know, we’ve got 50,000 people in Sauk County, and in 2016, Trump won by 109 votes.” In 2020, he lost the county by 615. These are not margins that lend themselves to sweeping conclusions. Still, Walker ran through the spiel about life in her purple county, how if there are six people sitting at the bar, three voted for Trump and three for Biden in 2020, and she knows all of them and where they work and what they drink and what they drive.</p> <p>If Wisconsin is one of the nation’s premier political battlegrounds, Sauk County is the battleground within the battleground, where the party lean is unpredictable and elections swing by hair’s-width margins. It contains left-leaning tourist towns in the Wisconsin Dells and liberal spillover from the college-town-cum-capital-city of Madison, as well as conservative rural villages and manufacturing centers. If you spot a parade of signs for Republican candidates sticking out of a lawn or a cornfield, or even the rare “Fuck Biden” flag flapping in the wind, you’re seldom far from a procession of signs for Democrats, or maybe even a “LOCK HIM UP.” (“Him” being Trump.)<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/ce/48423fca4a3aa01cf9dfc12043e0/20221013-wis-voters-16.jpeg\"> <br> <p>In this way Sauk mirrors the electoral closeness of the state as a whole, where four of the past six presidential contests were decided by less than a percentage point. Now, as the state faces high-profile contests for its governorship and a U.S. Senate seat that could determine which party controls the whole chamber — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, hoping to hold onto their jobs — Sauk County is a good place to study just what makes Wisconsin so, for lack of a better word, Wisconsiny.</p> <p>Because Wisconsin, at least judging by its current vicious and expensive campaigns, is not so much purple as polarized; it’s a state where <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01056-0\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“median voter theorem”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01056-0&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71060001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">“median voter theorem”</a><b> </b>goes to die. You might expect politicians in such a closely divided electorate to tack toward the center, take for granted their bases’ votes and cultivate just enough ideological crossover appeal to get to 51 percent. But another way to deal with such an even split is to prioritize turnout over persuasion, which means activating a party’s core of most likely voters, which means stoking partisanship and elevating extremes.

This well-predated the Trump-related polarization that has since swept much of the rest of the country. “I’m not sure it’s really an honor,” Franklin says, “but we were there first.”</p> <p>The problem for normal Wisconsinites is that most of them aren’t really anybody’s base; many I spoke to in Sauk don’t feel represented by the extremes of either party. Kari Walker (the Reedsburg chef, no relation to Walker, the former governor) herself was a somewhat disengaged Republican until Trump ran, and she used to consider herself pro-life as well. Now she listens to “Pod Save America” or the Jan. 6 hearings while she cooks, and she organizes letter-writing campaigns for Democrats. “Democracy is my top issue,” she said. “And my second issue would be reproductive rights.” (Wisconsin abortion clinics <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/no-wisconsin-clinics-are-providing-abortions-friday-after-scotus-struck-down-roe-v-wade\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;have ceased&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wpr.org/no-wisconsin-clinics-are-providing-abortions-friday-after-scotus-struck-down-roe-v-wade&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71060008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71060009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">have ceased</a> operation since the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v.

The manager, Sean McNevin, took me through the warehouse and explained how helium shortages and various supply-chain issues are affecting the business, which buys metals from mills and cuts them up to sell to manufacturers. Notwithstanding politicians’ vows to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest, McNevin said many of his manufacturing clients can’t find enough workers. “It’s a very strong environment for manufacturing.” His top issue is the economy, which he said was now like a roller coaster for a lot of industries, “and we’re just waiting for that drop.” He was noncommittal when I asked for his own views on the midterms but thinks it’s likely that both the Democratic governor and the Republican senator will win in November, because Wisconsinites won’t want to give either party <i>carte blanche</i>.</p> <p>By Election Day, by <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/adimpact-predicts-344m-will-be-spent-on-ads-in-wisconsin-races\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;one estimate&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/adimpact-predicts-344m-will-be-spent-on-ads-in-wisconsin-races&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71070000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71070001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">one estimate</a>, Wisconsinites will have endured some $344-million worth of political advertising, much of which seeks to paint the top candidates on either side as “too extreme” for the state. Voters are set to determine whether abortion will remain illegal, how voting will work in their state, who gets to certify the results of the 2024 presidential election, and possibly which party controls the U.S. Senate. Sauk County offers a glimpse into the split mind of Wisconsin on all of these issues, in a state where many people seem sick of politics, but the politics only seem to get worse, because tiny margins can have big results, and each party sees the stakes as existential.</p> <p>For swing voters like McNevin, it can all be a bit tiring. “It feels like we’re being punished for something.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6e/79/9852f63c48b381d325294594d5e3/20221014-wis-voters-23.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>On one extreme of</b> Sauk County politics lies Sauk City, birthplace of the iconic midwestern fast food chain Culver’s, which has a population of about 3,500 and which Biden won by 28 points in 2020. On the other, a mere 24 miles to the northwest, is Rock Springs, with less than one-tenth of the population at barely 300 people, where Biden lost by 42 points. “What’s interesting about Sauk County is that the denser the population is even within the county, the bluer it is,” said Franklin. “And when you get into the open countryside, the redder it is.”</p> <p>Sauk City, on the blue end of the color spectrum, is an old farm-town but also a commuter haven for Madison liberals; on its outskirts, the family-owned Dorf Haus supper club is an area favorite for fish fry and German food. (As for what distinguishes a “supper club” from a “restaurant,” family member Mitch Maier isn’t exactly sure but thinks a supper club probably needs a deer head on the wall and a reputation for stiff cocktails to qualify). Friday night patrons feigned reluctance to talk about politics, but it was pretty easy to get them going. Maybe that had something to do with the generous brandy Old Fashioneds Mitch’s brother Monte was serving.</p> <p>“It’s very divided,” said a woman named Peggy who declined to give her last name. She had no interest in further alienating anybody; she said her godchild had already unfriended her on Facebook, and her liberal friends were “very staunch,” to the point that “politics have become: ‘Well, you’re stupid,’” she said. “They elected a guy with Alzheimer’s, so who’s stupid? … I’m not a Trumper, we just can’t keep doing what we’re doing.” Her husband, Jim, is 75, a Vietnam veteran and former Democrat who said he switched parties in 2016 because “there was no way I was gonna vote for Hillary.” Now he feels Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes is too far left for the state and finds Johnson to be the better choice, but he said it’s hard to get good information. “You can’t believe what anybody says anymore,” he said. “That’s just scary.”</p> <p>A young couple, Robert Hanson and Samantha Steur, listened to this analysis and stayed largely quiet, except to agree that politics was too divisive, even in Wisconsin’s supposed bastion of Midwest nice. They opened up later at their table, over the schnitzel and spaetzle, where Steur observed that “the left is too far left and the right is too far right” — including Barnes and Johnson respectively. “We’re middle-of-the-road people,” Hanson put in: Both want politicians to try to bring folks together, and the couple sees little of that in the state’s current crop. Hanson feels alienated by the identity politics of the left, but said his top issue is democracy, and he can’t stomach voting for a Republican.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/00/1c/5d40cc51426395a179a5930f2ffb/20221014-wis-voters-21.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Meanwhile, said Steur, “There are two Wisconsins. There’s the one in downtown Madison, and there’s the one at dive bars in Prairie du Sac,” the town adjacent to where we were sitting. “I love both of them. … I don’t know how to build the bridge — or rebuild it, if there ever was one.”</p> <p>Rock Springs is a chunk of the other, redder Wisconsin, and that’s where Ken Pieper sells popcorn from an old-timey wagon about a block away from a mead distillery. Pieper owns River Creek Popcorn, which used to operate out of a storefront until floods ripped through the small downtown and destroyed it. Now, he’s conveniently situated outside his own house, which sports a sign on the lawn for Tim Michels, the Republican challenger to Evers. “There’s a stupid part of this, too,” Pieper said of working so close to home. His former sunroom is overrun with popcorn paraphernalia.</p> <p>He and his brother Dennis stepped out of the wagon to sit on a bench in the chilly sunshine and talk politics, which they usually try not to do, since they’re on opposite sides. Both grew up in Sauk County, on a farm about a mile outside of town, and Ken has a simple explanation for how his brother’s political path diverged from his own. “Ding-a-ling went to work for the teachers union.”</p> <p>Ken hopes Michels wins the governor’s race because “education in Wisconsin is trashed. … I don’t think it was necessarily [Evers] that trashed it, but he ain’t necessarily helped.” (Dennis interjected: “It was Scott Walker that trashed it. I taught for 35 years, so I know.”) Ken just hopes Michels, a wealthy businessman and political novice in Wisconsin who got Trump’s endorsement and then won the GOP primary, won’t be another Trump. Ken likes some of what Trump did for the country, but “If he’d stayed off Twitter and learned to zip his trap, he would’ve been a whole lot better politician. … That kind of worries me about Michels, I mean, he is kind of a Trump person.”</p> <p>The Ken/Dennis divide encapsulates the right/left divide in the midterms: For Ken, the economy is the top issue, and for Dennis, it’s abortion. “The economy was already starting to go downhill badly already when Covid came in,” Dennis said. “So how can you say it’s a Democratic thing when basically it’s been here for four years already?”</p> <p>There followed a semi-friendly bickering match over whether Mandela Barnes is too far left.</p> <p>Dennis: “And you’re thinking your guy isn’t too far right?”</p> <p>Ken: “You can’t get any farther left than with Mandela Barnes.”</p> <p>Dennis: “In what way?”</p> <p>Ken: “Pro-abortion, large federal government, expansion of the government …”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/19/c7e5c71a458db5b45c1ab3cad2eb/20221013-wis-voters-38.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Dennis: “You don’t think Obamacare was good?”</p> <p>Ken: “Not especially. It still was aimed at getting bigger government. … It’s states’ rights, not federal government, that needs to run this country.”</p> <p>Dennis: “So what’s wrong with abortion right now? They’ve given it to states’ rights and now every state’s against every other state.”</p> <p>Ken: “It always was states’ rights. It’s your nutty Supreme Court people called it something else.”</p> <p>Dennis: “But I think at that time it was still five-four in favor of Republicans. …”</p> <p>Ken: “It was a highly liberal Supreme Court. So don’t give me that nonsense.”</p> <p>And so on, down what was clearly quite familiar, and tiresome, terrain to them both. The political conversation dissipated fairly soon into Midwestern sports teams, about which they’re more in agreement, and a bit later the two got back to selling popcorn, wedged with their incompatible worldviews into the same small wagon.</p> <p>They seem to make it work the way Ken said the rest of the county gets along: “It’s kind of a mutual ignoring of the issues.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/5d/083600604b7ea5183e8fc83588f1/20221014-wis-voters-57.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>Just over the county </b>line on a Saturday morning, Leah Spicer and her sister Moriah pushed a stroller containing Moriah’s baby with a “LEAH SPICER FOR STATE ASSEMBLY” sign sticking out of the top.

Spicer jumped in when she saw no one planned to challenge Novak this year, because she doesn’t feel Republicans are representing the state well. “They have drawn the districts in such a way that they can maintain their political power without listening to their constituents,” she said.</p> <p>The district being what it is, when potential voters answer the door, she doesn’t lead with her affiliation. “I’m a little bit nervous about tying myself to the Democratic Party,” she told me. “There’s a lot of mistrust, I think, in politics in general, just like it’s something that happens far away. Politicians don’t represent us well, understand our communities, and I’m really trying to run as like a rural politician, who lives here, who understands.” She ticked off her own personal concerns: Three kids in rural public schools she says are under-funded; a small business, a restaurant she owns in the (liberal) Sauk County village of Spring Green, struggling with costs; aging parents on Social Security; family farm vulnerable to climate change. “In terms of political polarization, we’ve got to brush all that aside,” she said. “Especially in rural areas” — she gestures at the surrounding village of Lone Rock, which bills itself as “the coldest in the nation with the warmest heart,” where the trees have lately burst into bright reds and oranges — “this is all we have. There’s not a lot of people out here. And so if we’re not working together, it’s not going to work.”</p> <p>So when one older woman answered the door that morning, remarked that her concerns were “a lot of stuff — I think the federal government is ridiculous,” and asked if Spicer was a Republican, Spicer sounded semi-apologetic to reveal she was running as a Democrat. But she was prepared. She likes to tell voters, as she did here, that Wisconsinites are independent, and they vote for the candidate, not the party. The woman took some literature — Spicer pointed out that her cell number was on there, for any questions or concerns — and said she would think about it. Another potential voter, a young man wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, answered “huh” when Spicer asks what his concerns were. He said he hadn’t voted since he was 18; he was too busy with work at the dairy farm and at his grandparents’ house. “I think both sides equally suck,” he said, but “I honestly never have complained to a politician. Don’t know how.” Spicer suggested: “Maybe you should start.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/28/52/f28d7fdf4f7cb10f42dc120f0d30/20221013-wis-voters-17.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Unlike for the U.S. Senate, there is no majority at stake in Wisconsin’s legislative races: That does and will continue to belong to Republicans, due to the way Republican-controlled legislatures have drawn the districts.

He noted that, while Republican Governor Scott Walker ultimately lost to Evers by a narrow margin in 2018, the progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin won her Senate race by a much larger margin that same year. “I’m like, how do you cast a vote for Scott Walker and then vote for Tammy Baldwin?” he said. “It’s a strange world, and this political stuff … it’s all strange.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e5/ba/bad6dc324ed38bd41d8d4a10f4f4/20221014-wis-voters-33.jpeg\"> <br> <p>At the Downtowner bar in Baraboo — which, incidentally, was the first home of the Ringling Brothers Circus nearly a century and a half before this year’s political circus — Matt Schmidt said he leaned right but didn’t feel too strongly about it. He’s a musician and self-described “tawdry redneck,” and he was looking forward to an upcoming gig in the Wisconsin Dells and pretty happy with life in general. To the extent I could find a political consensus in close-split Sauk County, Schmidt summed it up the best of anyone. “If you’re on the extreme of either side,” he said, “you’re part of the fuckin’ problem.”<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"SAUK COUNTY, Wis. — One recent Friday, the town of Reedsburg’s most famous resident was caffeinating while she mixed up coleslaw in a big blue bowl. I’d picked up a Culver’s coffee for her on my way because I felt sheepish: Kari Walker deals with reporters every time an election rolls around, because she happens to own a bar and restaurant in the politically swingiest county in one of the politically swingiest states in the country, and it’s one that tends to pick winners.\n Everybody, she says, wants to know what “secret sauce” accounts for Sauk County’s uncanny record, including voting for the victor in 10 of the last 11 presidential elections; it’s one of only two counties in the state that swung from Obama to Trump and then back to Biden, and Reedsburg itself had gone with the winning candidates in Wisconsin governors’ and Senate races dating back to 2010. “I’ve been on the TV in France,” she’d told me on the phone the night before. Also on CNN, and in Reuters and Agence France-Presse — appearances I’d learned about from a 2020 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article\",\"_id\":\"00000184-1b67-d3a9-afb4-7f6701f10000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article, which featured her third interview with that paper alone.\n Walker does not, however, overpromise in the manner of many other pundits. “Everyone descends because they’re hoping somebody is going to crack the code,” she said, but “I don’t think the code is crackable. You know, we’ve got 50,000 people in Sauk County, and in 2016, Trump won by 109 votes.” In 2020, he lost the county by 615. These are not margins that lend themselves to sweeping conclusions. Still, Walker ran through the spiel about life in her purple county, how if there are six people sitting at the bar, three voted for Trump and three for Biden in 2020, and she knows all of them and where they work and what they drink and what they drive.\n If Wisconsin is one of the nation’s premier political battlegrounds, Sauk County is the battleground within the battleground, where the party lean is unpredictable and elections swing by hair’s-width margins. It contains left-leaning tourist towns in the Wisconsin Dells and liberal spillover from the college-town-cum-capital-city of Madison, as well as conservative rural villages and manufacturing centers. If you spot a parade of signs for Republican candidates sticking out of a lawn or a cornfield, or even the rare “Fuck Biden” flag flapping in the wind, you’re seldom far from a procession of signs for Democrats, or maybe even a “LOCK HIM UP.” (“Him” being Trump.)\n \n  \n In this way Sauk mirrors the electoral closeness of the state as a whole, where four of the past six presidential contests were decided by less than a percentage point. Now, as the state faces high-profile contests for its governorship and a U.S. Senate seat that could determine which party controls the whole chamber — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, hoping to hold onto their jobs — Sauk County is a good place to study just what makes Wisconsin so, for lack of a better word, Wisconsiny.\n Because Wisconsin, at least judging by its current vicious and expensive campaigns, is not so much purple as polarized; it’s a state where “median voter theorem” goes to die. You might expect politicians in such a closely divided electorate to tack toward the center, take for granted their bases’ votes and cultivate just enough ideological crossover appeal to get to 51 percent. But another way to deal with such an even split is to prioritize turnout over persuasion, which means activating a party’s core of most likely voters, which means stoking partisanship and elevating extremes. By no means is the “base election” a Wisconsin innovation à la unemployment insurance or the ButterBurger — some credit Karl Rove with the nationwide 21st-century version — but the state does dramatically show off the result. Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate delegation is perhaps the most polarized in the country, with the same state having sent to Washington, not two moderates, but one of the Senate’s most conservative members in Johnson and one of its most liberal in Tammy Baldwin.\n \n  \n “Everything makes a big difference when the race is decided by 23,000 votes,” said Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “So both parties think everything matters” — like, say, the ballot drop boxes and election-related grant money that fueled a widespread and mistaken belief among Republicans that Joe Biden did not win the state fairly in 2020. “The paradox of really close elections in a very polarized partisan environment is the parties pay an awful lot of attention to pandering to their base, because they absolutely need every partisan vote they can get.” Franklin traces the state’s sharp polarization back to the era of Republican Governor Scott Walker and the fights over public-sector unions beginning in 2011, which he says poisoned intra-party cooperation and helped usher in a winner-take-all partisanship. This well-predated the Trump-related polarization that has since swept much of the rest of the country. “I’m not sure it’s really an honor,” Franklin says, “but we were there first.”\n The problem for normal Wisconsinites is that most of them aren’t really anybody’s base; many I spoke to in Sauk don’t feel represented by the extremes of either party. Kari Walker (the Reedsburg chef, no relation to Walker, the former governor) herself was a somewhat disengaged Republican until Trump ran, and she used to consider herself pro-life as well. Now she listens to “Pod Save America” or the Jan. 6 hearings while she cooks, and she organizes letter-writing campaigns for Democrats. “Democracy is my top issue,” she said. “And my second issue would be reproductive rights.” (Wisconsin abortion clinics have ceased operation since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, under an 1849 state law that bans abortions.) I also met people in Sauk who weren’t Republicans until Trump ran, who maybe didn’t love the tweeting but certainly dislike this current inflation-rattled economy much more. My conversations in Sauk County mirrored the results of Franklin’s latest poll for Marquette: There’s almost no overlap in the top issues for likely Democratic and likely Republican voters. For Democrats it’s gun violence and abortion; for Republicans it’s inflation and crime.\n \n  \n Five minutes or so down East Main Street from Walker’s restaurant, Wisconsin Metals has a “help wanted” sign out front in search of a fabricator. The manager, Sean McNevin, took me through the warehouse and explained how helium shortages and various supply-chain issues are affecting the business, which buys metals from mills and cuts them up to sell to manufacturers. Notwithstanding politicians’ vows to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest, McNevin said many of his manufacturing clients can’t find enough workers. “It’s a very strong environment for manufacturing.” His top issue is the economy, which he said was now like a roller coaster for a lot of industries, “and we’re just waiting for that drop.” He was noncommittal when I asked for his own views on the midterms but thinks it’s likely that both the Democratic governor and the Republican senator will win in November, because Wisconsinites won’t want to give either party carte blanche.\n By Election Day, by one estimate, Wisconsinites will have endured some $344-million worth of political advertising, much of which seeks to paint the top candidates on either side as “too extreme” for the state. Voters are set to determine whether abortion will remain illegal, how voting will work in their state, who gets to certify the results of the 2024 presidential election, and possibly which party controls the U.S. Senate. Sauk County offers a glimpse into the split mind of Wisconsin on all of these issues, in a state where many people seem sick of politics, but the politics only seem to get worse, because tiny margins can have big results, and each party sees the stakes as existential.\n For swing voters like McNevin, it can all be a bit tiring. “It feels like we’re being punished for something.”\n \n  \n  \nOn one extreme of Sauk County politics lies Sauk City, birthplace of the iconic midwestern fast food chain Culver’s, which has a population of about 3,500 and which Biden won by 28 points in 2020. On the other, a mere 24 miles to the northwest, is Rock Springs, with less than one-tenth of the population at barely 300 people, where Biden lost by 42 points. “What’s interesting about Sauk County is that the denser the population is even within the county, the bluer it is,” said Franklin. “And when you get into the open countryside, the redder it is.”\n Sauk City, on the blue end of the color spectrum, is an old farm-town but also a commuter haven for Madison liberals; on its outskirts, the family-owned Dorf Haus supper club is an area favorite for fish fry and German food. (As for what distinguishes a “supper club” from a “restaurant,” family member Mitch Maier isn’t exactly sure but thinks a supper club probably needs a deer head on the wall and a reputation for stiff cocktails to qualify). Friday night patrons feigned reluctance to talk about politics, but it was pretty easy to get them going. Maybe that had something to do with the generous brandy Old Fashioneds Mitch’s brother Monte was serving.\n “It’s very divided,” said a woman named Peggy who declined to give her last name. She had no interest in further alienating anybody; she said her godchild had already unfriended her on Facebook, and her liberal friends were “very staunch,” to the point that “politics have become: ‘Well, you’re stupid,’” she said. “They elected a guy with Alzheimer’s, so who’s stupid? … I’m not a Trumper, we just can’t keep doing what we’re doing.” Her husband, Jim, is 75, a Vietnam veteran and former Democrat who said he switched parties in 2016 because “there was no way I was gonna vote for Hillary.” Now he feels Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes is too far left for the state and finds Johnson to be the better choice, but he said it’s hard to get good information. “You can’t believe what anybody says anymore,” he said. “That’s just scary.”\n A young couple, Robert Hanson and Samantha Steur, listened to this analysis and stayed largely quiet, except to agree that politics was too divisive, even in Wisconsin’s supposed bastion of Midwest nice. They opened up later at their table, over the schnitzel and spaetzle, where Steur observed that “the left is too far left and the right is too far right” — including Barnes and Johnson respectively. “We’re middle-of-the-road people,” Hanson put in: Both want politicians to try to bring folks together, and the couple sees little of that in the state’s current crop. Hanson feels alienated by the identity politics of the left, but said his top issue is democracy, and he can’t stomach voting for a Republican.\n \n  \n Meanwhile, said Steur, “There are two Wisconsins. There’s the one in downtown Madison, and there’s the one at dive bars in Prairie du Sac,” the town adjacent to where we were sitting. “I love both of them. … I don’t know how to build the bridge — or rebuild it, if there ever was one.”\n Rock Springs is a chunk of the other, redder Wisconsin, and that’s where Ken Pieper sells popcorn from an old-timey wagon about a block away from a mead distillery. Pieper owns River Creek Popcorn, which used to operate out of a storefront until floods ripped through the small downtown and destroyed it. Now, he’s conveniently situated outside his own house, which sports a sign on the lawn for Tim Michels, the Republican challenger to Evers. “There’s a stupid part of this, too,” Pieper said of working so close to home. His former sunroom is overrun with popcorn paraphernalia.\n He and his brother Dennis stepped out of the wagon to sit on a bench in the chilly sunshine and talk politics, which they usually try not to do, since they’re on opposite sides. Both grew up in Sauk County, on a farm about a mile outside of town, and Ken has a simple explanation for how his brother’s political path diverged from his own. “Ding-a-ling went to work for the teachers union.”\n Ken hopes Michels wins the governor’s race because “education in Wisconsin is trashed. … I don’t think it was necessarily [Evers] that trashed it, but he ain’t necessarily helped.” (Dennis interjected: “It was Scott Walker that trashed it. I taught for 35 years, so I know.”) Ken just hopes Michels, a wealthy businessman and political novice in Wisconsin who got Trump’s endorsement and then won the GOP primary, won’t be another Trump. Ken likes some of what Trump did for the country, but “If he’d stayed off Twitter and learned to zip his trap, he would’ve been a whole lot better politician. … That kind of worries me about Michels, I mean, he is kind of a Trump person.”\n The Ken/Dennis divide encapsulates the right/left divide in the midterms: For Ken, the economy is the top issue, and for Dennis, it’s abortion. “The economy was already starting to go downhill badly already when Covid came in,” Dennis said. “So how can you say it’s a Democratic thing when basically it’s been here for four years already?”\n There followed a semi-friendly bickering match over whether Mandela Barnes is too far left.\n Dennis: “And you’re thinking your guy isn’t too far right?”\n Ken: “You can’t get any farther left than with Mandela Barnes.”\n Dennis: “In what way?”\n Ken: “Pro-abortion, large federal government, expansion of the government …”\n \n  \n Dennis: “You don’t think Obamacare was good?”\n Ken: “Not especially. It still was aimed at getting bigger government. … It’s states’ rights, not federal government, that needs to run this country.”\n Dennis: “So what’s wrong with abortion right now? They’ve given it to states’ rights and now every state’s against every other state.”\n Ken: “It always was states’ rights. It’s your nutty Supreme Court people called it something else.”\n Dennis: “But I think at that time it was still five-four in favor of Republicans. …”\n Ken: “It was a highly liberal Supreme Court. So don’t give me that nonsense.”\n And so on, down what was clearly quite familiar, and tiresome, terrain to them both. The political conversation dissipated fairly soon into Midwestern sports teams, about which they’re more in agreement, and a bit later the two got back to selling popcorn, wedged with their incompatible worldviews into the same small wagon.\n They seem to make it work the way Ken said the rest of the county gets along: “It’s kind of a mutual ignoring of the issues.”\n \n  \n  \nJust over the county line on a Saturday morning, Leah Spicer and her sister Moriah pushed a stroller containing Moriah’s baby with a “LEAH SPICER FOR STATE ASSEMBLY” sign sticking out of the top. The kid mostly napped while Spicer knocked on doors and introduced herself to potential voters in the 51st District, the most competitive of the three assembly districts that contain parts of Sauk County. (Of the two others, naturally, one is held by a Democrat and the other by a Republican.)\n Spicer is a 29-year-old Democrat hoping to unseat the four-term Republican Assemblyman Todd Novak. She thinks she’s got a decent shot, although the district is R+1, and a CNalysis state legislative forecast favors Novak. She points out Novak won his first race by 65 votes, although last cycle he had his best margin ever with 1,258 votes (out of about 30,000 cast in the race). Spicer jumped in when she saw no one planned to challenge Novak this year, because she doesn’t feel Republicans are representing the state well. “They have drawn the districts in such a way that they can maintain their political power without listening to their constituents,” she said.\n The district being what it is, when potential voters answer the door, she doesn’t lead with her affiliation. “I’m a little bit nervous about tying myself to the Democratic Party,” she told me. “There’s a lot of mistrust, I think, in politics in general, just like it’s something that happens far away. Politicians don’t represent us well, understand our communities, and I’m really trying to run as like a rural politician, who lives here, who understands.” She ticked off her own personal concerns: Three kids in rural public schools she says are under-funded; a small business, a restaurant she owns in the (liberal) Sauk County village of Spring Green, struggling with costs; aging parents on Social Security; family farm vulnerable to climate change. “In terms of political polarization, we’ve got to brush all that aside,” she said. “Especially in rural areas” — she gestures at the surrounding village of Lone Rock, which bills itself as “the coldest in the nation with the warmest heart,” where the trees have lately burst into bright reds and oranges — “this is all we have. There’s not a lot of people out here. And so if we’re not working together, it’s not going to work.”\n So when one older woman answered the door that morning, remarked that her concerns were “a lot of stuff — I think the federal government is ridiculous,” and asked if Spicer was a Republican, Spicer sounded semi-apologetic to reveal she was running as a Democrat. But she was prepared. She likes to tell voters, as she did here, that Wisconsinites are independent, and they vote for the candidate, not the party. The woman took some literature — Spicer pointed out that her cell number was on there, for any questions or concerns — and said she would think about it. Another potential voter, a young man wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, answered “huh” when Spicer asks what his concerns were. He said he hadn’t voted since he was 18; he was too busy with work at the dairy farm and at his grandparents’ house. “I think both sides equally suck,” he said, but “I honestly never have complained to a politician. Don’t know how.” Spicer suggested: “Maybe you should start.”\n \n  \n Unlike for the U.S. Senate, there is no majority at stake in Wisconsin’s legislative races: That does and will continue to belong to Republicans, due to the way Republican-controlled legislatures have drawn the districts. (A common Democratic complaint in the state is that, while Wisconsin voted 49.4/48.8 in favor of Biden over Trump in 2020, Republicans control 58 percent of the seats in the state Assembly and 64 percent of the seats in the state Senate.) But in some ways the stakes are even higher, because the question is whether Republicans will get a legislative supermajority that can override a governor’s veto, for which they would only need five additional seats in the Assembly and one in the Senate. Democrat Tony Evers has vetoed a record 126 bills this legislative session alone on wildly polarized issues from gun rights to school choice to unemployment benefits. Michels has vowed to sign them if elected, but with a legislative supermajority, Republicans wouldn’t even need the governor’s office to turn those bills into law.\n \n  \n Given how few competitive legislative districts are left, the Sauk County Democrats are hoping to gain some ground in the 51st. At a debate watch party in the Sauk Dems’ office, which shares space with a flooring store in a strip mall in the county seat of Baraboo, a spectator grumbled when Michels vowed to leave abortion access up to the legislature which, Michels said, represents the people of the state. “Not in Wisconsin, it doesn’t,” said the Sauk Democrat. The Democratic chair for the county is Tammy Wood, who sports blue highlights in her hair and is fired up for November. “I’m feeling good about it all,” she told me after the debate. She says she’s not even worried about Mandela Barnes’ lackluster recent polling against Ron Johnson, that it’s remarkable Dems are running so close to Republicans while their party is in power nationally. “But we’re gonna have to bust knuckle to make it happen. … We cannot go back to that same ‘divide and conquer’” that she says characterized the Scott Walker era.\n \n  \n But the county Republicans are feeling good, too, their former county chair Scott Frostman told me, especially with Johnson leading Barnes by the Wisconsin-comfortable margin of six points in the latest Marquette poll. Frostman believes that, given the economy, Democrats don’t have much to run on, and he said people don’t bring up the abortion issue much when he knocks doors, albeit Republican and independent-leaning ones. Michels, meanwhile, had recently gotten the endorsement of the Tavern League, the trade group for bars around the state, which he’d accepted at a bar in Baraboo. Frostman, too, admits the elections will come down to turnout, and that there’s no real predicting what Wisconsin voters will do. He noted that, while Republican Governor Scott Walker ultimately lost to Evers by a narrow margin in 2018, the progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin won her Senate race by a much larger margin that same year. “I’m like, how do you cast a vote for Scott Walker and then vote for Tammy Baldwin?” he said. “It’s a strange world, and this political stuff … it’s all strange.”\n \n  \n At the Downtowner bar in Baraboo — which, incidentally, was the first home of the Ringling Brothers Circus nearly a century and a half before this year’s political circus — Matt Schmidt said he leaned right but didn’t feel too strongly about it. He’s a musician and self-described “tawdry redneck,” and he was looking forward to an upcoming gig in the Wisconsin Dells and pretty happy with life in general. To the extent I could find a political consensus in close-split Sauk County, Schmidt summed it up the best of anyone. “If you’re on the extreme of either side,” he said, “you’re part of the fuckin’ problem.”","dc:creator":"Kathy Gilsinan","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/f0/fd/d0be8e6f4961ade31562fec8cb3b/lede.sauk.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Andy Manis for POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Wisconsin voters watch a televised governor’s debate at the Sauk County Democratic Party headquarters in Baraboo, Wis., between incumbent Gov.

What the Woodward sessions with Trump prove — as if it needed proving — is that interviewing Trump is and has always been a futile gesture. It’s not that no news comes out of a Trump interview. He can always be relied on to say something that will set the chyrons at all three cable news networks pulsing. But in most cases, this one included, the interview is a hot diaper mess that mainly illustrates Trump’s narcissism and willful ignorance. He doesn’t really know anything, which is forgivable. But he also doesn’t want to know anything, which isn’t.</p> <p>Woodward’s frustration becomes palpable in the excerpt. “He is staggeringly incautious and repetitive,” Woodward writes, “as if saying something often and loud enough will make it true.” Trump made himself amply available, Woodward writes, so much so that the interviewer kept tape recorders in multiple locations inside his house because he could expect the president to call at any time. Trump vowed to answer questions on any topic, Woodward notes. But giving Woodward a first-class ticket on the access journalism express doesn’t really reveal much new about Trump because we’ve heard so much of it before.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314387828112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p><br><b>He avoids giving straight answers to straight questions:</b> Woodward asks if the president of the United States should be asking foreign leaders to investigate his political opponents.

It amounted to a large-scale deception and coverup.”</p> <p><b>He ignores questions and freestyles some brazen lies:</b> When Woodward asks what his Covid plan is in late July 2020, Trump claims that the virus is “flaring up all over the world” but “we have it under control,” which wasn’t the case. Woodward presses Trump for details on the Covid plan only to be told, “Bob, you’ll see the plan over the next four weeks.” Writes Woodward of Trump’s ineptitude, “I wondered how you execute a plan that doesn’t exist.”</p> <p><b>He turns questions into platforms for bragging and personalization:&nbsp;</b>“I think we’re doing a very good job,” Trump says of his Covid response. “We’ve done better than any — other than with the press. Other than with the press, I’ve done a great job.” On his relationship with Kim Jong Un, “I get a sense he likes me. I think he likes me.”</p> <p><b>He feels, as ever, put upon:&nbsp;</b>“I have opposition like nobody has. … I was unlucky with the virus. …”</p> <p><b>He wallows in non sequiturs:&nbsp;</b>Woodward asks if buddying up to Kim Jong Un was strategically designed and Trump answers, “No. No. It was designed for whatever reason, it was designed. Who knows? Instinctively. Let’s talk instinct.”</p> <p>The crowning lesson of the Trump era, one that Woodward appears to have gleaned from his reporting, is that only one subject fully engages Trump’s interest, and that is Trump. Having Woodward approach him to serve as his Boswell apparently caused Trump’s ego to go def con 3. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/23/1130712231/the-trump-tapes-reveal-much-about-bob-woodward-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Elsewhere&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/10/23/1130712231/the-trump-tapes-reveal-much-about-bob-woodward-donald-trump&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b716e000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b716e000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Elsewhere</a> on the tapes, Trump refers to Woodward as “a great historian” and “the great Bob Woodward.” Trump appears to have understood from the beginning that the service of his ego might backfire, yet he would still take the risk.

It amounted to a large-scale deception and coverup.”\n He ignores questions and freestyles some brazen lies: When Woodward asks what his Covid plan is in late July 2020, Trump claims that the virus is “flaring up all over the world” but “we have it under control,” which wasn’t the case. Woodward presses Trump for details on the Covid plan only to be told, “Bob, you’ll see the plan over the next four weeks.” Writes Woodward of Trump’s ineptitude, “I wondered how you execute a plan that doesn’t exist.”\n He turns questions into platforms for bragging and personalization: “I think we’re doing a very good job,” Trump says of his Covid response. “We’ve done better than any — other than with the press. Other than with the press, I’ve done a great job.” On his relationship with Kim Jong Un, “I get a sense he likes me. I think he likes me.”\n He feels, as ever, put upon: “I have opposition like nobody has. … I was unlucky with the virus. …”\n He wallows in non sequiturs: Woodward asks if buddying up to Kim Jong Un was strategically designed and Trump answers, “No. No. It was designed for whatever reason, it was designed. Who knows? Instinctively. Let’s talk instinct.”\n The crowning lesson of the Trump era, one that Woodward appears to have gleaned from his reporting, is that only one subject fully engages Trump’s interest, and that is Trump. Having Woodward approach him to serve as his Boswell apparently caused Trump’s ego to go def con 3. Elsewhere on the tapes, Trump refers to Woodward as “a great historian” and “the great Bob Woodward.” Trump appears to have understood from the beginning that the service of his ego might backfire, yet he would still take the risk. In the 14th interview session, Trump says to Woodward, “You’re probably going to screw me. Because, you know, that’s the way it goes. Look, [George W.] Bush sat with you for hours and you screwed him. But the difference was, I ain’t no Bush.”\n Trump’s reaction to the audiobook news has been to threaten Woodward with a lawsuit, his go-to move whenever the news cycle displeases him. “We’ve already hired the lawyers,” Trump told a radio show host last week. The grounds for Trump’s suit reflect his feeling that the tapes are “his,” because they were granted for print journalism purposes (Woodward’s Trump book, Rage\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/bob-woodward-trump-tapes-audiobook-recorded-interviews\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b716e0012\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b716e0013\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Rage), not audio ones. The legal logic here parallels his belief that the government documents he allegedly pilfered and stored in Mar-a-Lago are his because he says they are.\n Trump interviews have been and will always be futile exercises in attempting to nail a blob of mercury because that’s the way he flows. He’s a double-talk artist who uses words as protective coloration because, as a flighty and fidgety guy, he resists the compunction to be consistent. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stop trying to get him on the record. It also doesn’t mean we should let him say whatever he wants without challenging him. But if Doorstop Bob Woodward can’t wring a coherent interrogation out of somebody after 20 interviews of 600 questions, nobody can. Interview him all you want, just don’t expect anything but puzzlement and frustration in return.\n ******\n “Hot diaper” is not my coinage.

Someday, perhaps, we will have an election in which people say, “You know, this one is actually not that big a deal — there’s little at stake either way.” Still, this year — with Donald Trump’s past, present and future still looming over all American politics — does genuinely qualify as consequential. Which means the after-election ruminations will similarly be among the most consequential.</p> <p>Two, Democrats are genuinely confronting a political moment that for most defies comprehension. As Nancy Pelosi put it in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/pelosi-democrats-midterms.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;interview with the New York Times&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/pelosi-democrats-midterms.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71580002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b71580003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">interview with the New York Times</a>, explaining her against-the-current optimism: “Part of it is, I can’t believe anybody would vote for these people.”</p> <p>In the 30 years that I have been covering politics, one constant was that people in both major parties had the same envious complaint about the other: <i>We are too principled for our own good. The opposition is just better at being ruthless than we are.</i></p> <p>What has changed in recent years is the end of equivalence. It is inconceivable to imagine any Democratic politician in modern times having such a grip on supporters that he or she would remain an unchallenged leader after losing an election or being under multiple simultaneous criminal investigations.</p> <p>The possibility that two seismic events — the revelations of the Jan. 6 committee about Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, and the Supreme Court’s June decision to revoke a constitutional right to abortion — might not reshape the political landscape in Democrats’ favor puts the question in the starkest light: What will it take to change the fundamentals?</p> <p>One answer is that Democrats perhaps shouldn’t be so hard on themselves, even if they lose congressional control. Since World War II, the party holding the White House has lost seats in every midterm election, except in 1998 (amid backlash to the Bill Clinton impeachment) and 2002 (with George W. Bush still commanding support a year after 9/11). It is only because Democrats last summer allowed expectations that 2022 would be another of those anomalous years to soar that the likely return of old patterns is so jarring.</p> <p>But another answer is that 2022 is in fact a year of useful experiments for Democrats. For decades, progressives like Sanders have argued that voters want a choice, not an echo — that drawing sharp stylistic lines and advocating an ambitious liberal agenda would motivate voters more effectively than play-it-safe centrism.</p> <p>Democrat John Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania against Trump-backed television physician Mehmet Oz, as well as Democrat Mandela Barnes’s effort to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, both offer good tests of the hypothesis. As both contests have become more challenging for Democrats, some allies of Barnes and Fetterman have complained of ineffective support from establishment Democrats in Washington.</p> <p>Also facing a severe test is the long-time belief among many Democrats that demography is destiny — that as the country becomes more diverse, a multiracial coalition would inevitably yield huge benefits for progressive candidates. In Nevada, however, a state with a large and growing Hispanic population, a Democratic incumbent, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whose mother was a Mexican immigrant, is in a close race against Republican Adam Laxalt, a Trump-backer who has challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election.</p> <p>Above all, the Democratic post-election analysis will have large implications for President Joseph Biden. Legislative victories and modestly improved poll numbers last summer quieted widespread grumbling among Democrats that he might be too old or too weakened to be the best Democratic nominee in 2024, especially if the outcome of losing is Trump’s return to the White House. This stewing will return in force if Democrats have especially weak midterms, in which an unpopular president was simply not welcome in many key races.</p> <p>Of course, it is not just Democrats who will be facing post-mortems. If Republicans fail to take the Senate, there will be widespread recriminations over candidate choices in several states, including Pennsylvania if Oz loses, and also in Georgia, where former football star Herschel Walker has run a stumbling campaign beset by allegations over his personal life.</p> <p>Amid all this fluidity, there is one reliable constant. Post-election debates are always a way of returning to arguments that the debaters have been waging for years. Just as no one ever says any election is unimportant, there has never been a documented case of an operative or election analyst saying, “Unfortunately, these results show that premises I have articulated for years now are just not true. I’m not sure what to say about the results except that I have been wrong about everything.”</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Twelve days before the election, Democrats have yet to lose the House or Senate, or confront the dire, your-lab-results-are-back-and-the-doctor-needs-to-see-you implications for a progressive agenda.\n Plenty of prominent party voices, however, believe it’s best to prepare in advance.

This kind of told-you-so fretting is common after a disappointing election, or even in not-my-fault, not-for-attribution chatter among operatives beforehand.\n \n \n There are two, closely related reasons why the soul-searching this year started early, even as there remains a decent (though some polls suggest dwindling) chance it won’t be needed.\n One, candidates and progressive commentators are describing 2022 as the most important midterm election in generations. Someday, perhaps, we will have an election in which people say, “You know, this one is actually not that big a deal — there’s little at stake either way.” Still, this year — with Donald Trump’s past, present and future still looming over all American politics — does genuinely qualify as consequential. Which means the after-election ruminations will similarly be among the most consequential.\n Two, Democrats are genuinely confronting a political moment that for most defies comprehension. As Nancy Pelosi put it in an interview with the New York Times, explaining her against-the-current optimism: “Part of it is, I can’t believe anybody would vote for these people.”\n In the 30 years that I have been covering politics, one constant was that people in both major parties had the same envious complaint about the other: We are too principled for our own good. The opposition is just better at being ruthless than we are.\n What has changed in recent years is the end of equivalence. It is inconceivable to imagine any Democratic politician in modern times having such a grip on supporters that he or she would remain an unchallenged leader after losing an election or being under multiple simultaneous criminal investigations.\n The possibility that two seismic events — the revelations of the Jan. 6 committee about Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, and the Supreme Court’s June decision to revoke a constitutional right to abortion — might not reshape the political landscape in Democrats’ favor puts the question in the starkest light: What will it take to change the fundamentals?\n One answer is that Democrats perhaps shouldn’t be so hard on themselves, even if they lose congressional control. Since World War II, the party holding the White House has lost seats in every midterm election, except in 1998 (amid backlash to the Bill Clinton impeachment) and 2002 (with George W. Bush still commanding support a year after 9/11). It is only because Democrats last summer allowed expectations that 2022 would be another of those anomalous years to soar that the likely return of old patterns is so jarring.\n But another answer is that 2022 is in fact a year of useful experiments for Democrats. For decades, progressives like Sanders have argued that voters want a choice, not an echo — that drawing sharp stylistic lines and advocating an ambitious liberal agenda would motivate voters more effectively than play-it-safe centrism.\n Democrat John Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania against Trump-backed television physician Mehmet Oz, as well as Democrat Mandela Barnes’s effort to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, both offer good tests of the hypothesis. As both contests have become more challenging for Democrats, some allies of Barnes and Fetterman have complained of ineffective support from establishment Democrats in Washington.\n Also facing a severe test is the long-time belief among many Democrats that demography is destiny — that as the country becomes more diverse, a multiracial coalition would inevitably yield huge benefits for progressive candidates. In Nevada, however, a state with a large and growing Hispanic population, a Democratic incumbent, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whose mother was a Mexican immigrant, is in a close race against Republican Adam Laxalt, a Trump-backer who has challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n Above all, the Democratic post-election analysis will have large implications for President Joseph Biden. Legislative victories and modestly improved poll numbers last summer quieted widespread grumbling among Democrats that he might be too old or too weakened to be the best Democratic nominee in 2024, especially if the outcome of losing is Trump’s return to the White House. This stewing will return in force if Democrats have especially weak midterms, in which an unpopular president was simply not welcome in many key races.\n Of course, it is not just Democrats who will be facing post-mortems. If Republicans fail to take the Senate, there will be widespread recriminations over candidate choices in several states, including Pennsylvania if Oz loses, and also in Georgia, where former football star Herschel Walker has run a stumbling campaign beset by allegations over his personal life.\n Amid all this fluidity, there is one reliable constant. Post-election debates are always a way of returning to arguments that the debaters have been waging for years. Just as no one ever says any election is unimportant, there has never been a documented case of an operative or election analyst saying, “Unfortunately, these results show that premises I have articulated for years now are just not true. I’m not sure what to say about the results except that I have been wrong about everything.”","dc:creator":"John F.

Foster began to have renal failure by age 26.\n “No one child or adult should go through the constant health battles that I’ve had to go through,” Foster said. “I’ve dealt with pain, trauma and the same mental issues I faced before.”","dc:creator":"Arek Sarkissian","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/b2/49/323c03d1487a9e87f2af4364aaf3/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1059945228"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Members from the Florida Board of Medicine and the state Board of Osteopathic Medicine approved rulemaking language that would ban children from taking hormones or undergoing surgery to treat gender dysphoria.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/b2/49/323c03d1487a9e87f2af4364aaf3/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1059945228"}}]},"content":"The rulemaking is the latest step taken by the DeSantis administration to tighten regulatory controls over gender-affirming care.","contentSnippet":"The rulemaking is the latest step taken by the DeSantis administration to tighten regulatory controls over gender-affirming care.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/28/florida-gender-affirming-treatments-kids-ban-00064039","isoDate":"2022-10-28T21:17:11.000Z"},{"title":"\n\n    Mondrian Artwork Has Been Hanging Upside Down For 75 Years\n\n","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mondrian-upside-down-75-years-new-york-city-germany_n_635c3c0fe4b023ac31c54a45","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 19:00:48 -0400","content:encoded":"\n\n    But to switch it around now could damage it, according to the art historian who discovered the error.\n\n","content:encodedSnippet":"But to switch it around now could damage it, according to the art historian who discovered the error.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/635c4cc826000060009f5641.jpeg?cache=s42schcztc&ops=224_126"},"comments":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mondrian-upside-down-75-years-new-york-city-germany_n_635c3c0fe4b023ac31c54a45#comments","content":"\n\n    But to switch it around now could damage it, according to the art historian who discovered the error.\n\n","contentSnippet":"But to switch it around now could damage it, according to the art historian who discovered the error.","guid":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mondrian-upside-down-75-years-new-york-city-germany_n_635c3c0fe4b023ac31c54a45","isoDate":"2022-10-28T23:00:48.000Z"},{"title":"McDonald's stock hits all time high ","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/business/mcdonalds-stock/index.html","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 19:46:30 GMT","content":"McDonald's stock hit an all time high Friday as Wall Street cheered the company's third quarter results.

Kathy Hochul faces a closer-than-expected challenge from GOP foe Lee Zeldin. Despite growing midterm anxiety in the White House, Biden's entry into battleground races has been limited and highly calculated.\n “Folks, we're here to celebrate one most significant investments in American history again, not hyperbole,\" Biden told the crowd. \"And it's going to ensure that the future is made in America. It’s one of the bright spots around the country that should give us a sense of optimism and hope about who we are as a nation.“\n \n \n Biden's event is in the heart of one of the biggest toss-up races in the nation: The contest between Democrat Francis Conole and Republican Brandon Williams to succeed moderate GOP Rep. John Katko in New York's 22nd District. It's also an area where Hochul will need to perform well to win. A Biden visit can rev up the party base while highlighting new jobs long sought in a region sapped by decades of manufacturing declines, party leaders said.\n The president is \"in demand in New York because he’s more popular in New York than he in some other places,\" state Democratic Committee chair Jay Jacobs said Wednesday. \"And I will tell you, he’s highlighting an achievement in New York\" to bring in new jobs.\n When Biden visited Poughkeepsie on Oct. 6, he was quick to highlight another House candidate in a tough race: Rep. Pat Ryan who \"proved the pundits wrong\" winning a special election in August and now is vying for a full term in another close race.\n Hochul said Thursday that the Micron deal males \"this is not just a chips corridor. This is chips country. This is New York State, and we're gonna build it here in New York.\"\n Even some local Republicans praised Biden's event as a means to highlight the Micron deal, which comes thanks to the federal CHIPS and Science Act passed by Congress in August. The legislation provides tax credits for U.S. companies and a $10 billion Green CHIPS incentive in New York.\n \"Having the president here is going to validate the investment,\" Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon, a Republican, said Wednesday. \"Hopefully it will make the community believe in the investment more. I don’t know if there’s a political agenda. Hopefully, it’s not so much.\"\n \n  \n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer led the effort to broker the Micron deal announced Oct. 4, and he joined Biden on Thursday, having encouraged the president's visit. He praised Hochul's role, too.\n \"We make an unstoppable team, and if I didn't have her fighting alongside me for New York, we wouldn't be here celebrating today,\" Schumer said of the governor.\n Syracuse also happens to be a special place for the president: His first wife, Neilia, was from nearby Skaneateles in the Finger Lakes and graduated from Syracuse University. They lived in Syracuse from 1966 to 1968 as he obtained his law degree. In fact, his home there was recently put up for sale.\n Biden noted his local roots and also touted Hochul.\n “When I was up here as a law student, we had Kodak, Corning, General Electric,\" he said. \"The governor's always believed it could be that way again. She thought that would be the case, and the region is poised to lead the world in advanced manufacturing. Not a joke, poised to lead the world.”\n In a state with twice as many Democrats as Republicans, Biden is more popular in New York than other places: A Siena College poll last week showed his approval at 53 percent positive to 43 percent negative — making him more liked than Hochul.\n But in the swing 22nd District, Biden isn't nearly as popular. He was viewed unfavorably by 53 percent of voters and favorably by 42 percent, an Oct. 4 Siena poll showed. And while 76 percent of Democrats viewed him positively, 82 percent of Republicans had a negative view of the president.\n That's on par with the president’s approval rating nationally, a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll Wednesday found.\n \"I think it’s a jump ball if there is an advantage\" for either side with Biden coming to the district, McMahon said.\n Biden isn't expected to attend any fundraisers on the trip, and Conole — the Democrat running for the 22nd District seat — is not expected to attend because it is government event, his campaign said. The Siena poll showed Republican rival Williams with a 5-point lead over Conole, 45 percent to 40 percent, heading into the final weeks before Election Day, Nov. 8.\n POLITICO’s forecast lists the race as one of the nation's 28 toss-ups. It's also a district that Biden carried by 8 percentage points in 2020.\n Jacobs said Biden's latest stop in New York won't just help the state's candidates, it will promote Biden's national domestic agenda.

He kept his job at the time, but when the Associated Press reported on the correspondence six months later, he was given the gate. It’s easy to see why: In reviewing tens of thousands of pages over eight years, the reporters turned up emails that seemed to show the two men bandying about business ideas, with Solomon saying things like, “Our business opportunities are so promising” and Azima wishing him luck on his “first defense sale” when he was supposed to deliver a $725 million proposal to the UAE government. Solomon denied everything other than mismanaging a source relationship, but it wasn’t a good look.</p> <p>These days, Solomon too is affiliated with a D.C. think tank, and isn’t trying to litigate his way back into journalism’s good graces. Instead, he’s calling the case a cautionary tale — not just for journalists who blur lines with sources, but for people who think working in Washington institutions means everything’s on the up-and-up.</p> <p>“This case illustrates how powerful individuals and entities can deploy vast resources and spend vast sums with the aim of silencing a journalist,” Solomon said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Noel J. Nudelman. “And it’s a trend that’s becoming a greater threat to journalism and media, as digital surveillance and hacking technologies evolve and become more potent and pervasive. This is a major threat to the freedom of the press. And steps need to be taken to protect journalists and their ability to do their important work.”</p> <p>But it’s probably a bit more complicated than that, and not just because Solomon’s email trail essentially provided his alleged tormentors the matches with which to torch his career. It wasn’t actually Solomon’s email that was accessed — it was that of a source who had spent a career involved in sensitive work in what amounts to a bad geopolitical neighborhood.</p> <p>In the same way, the same month as Solomon’s firing, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, was the subject of a celebrated hack that led to the release of his correspondence with a variety of Washington players, many of whom had once assumed that they, too, lived in a safe world.</p> <p>“Jay and I came to the conclusion that we were both hit by the same mercenary hackers albeit hired by two different clients,” Otaiba told me this week.</p> <p>Indeed, the hostility between Iran and its Gulf neighbors, and the related standoff pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE, has a way of spilling into Washington controversies, from the downfall of Brookings Institution President John Allen (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/17/john-allen-brookings-institution-fbi-qatar-00040380\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/17/john-allen-brookings-institution-fbi-qatar-00040380&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70ec0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70ec0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank</a>, he was never charged but did lose his job, something that was cheered by many Beltway opponents of the emirate) to the release of emails of folks like Otaiba and Solomon (both of whom tend to be viewed with suspicion by many of Qatar’s stateside admirers and by folks in favor of rapprochement with Iran). <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The AP reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70ec000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70ec000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">The AP reported</a> on Thursday that the FBI is probing an ex-CIA operative for allegedly spying on Qatar’s rivals, including U.S. figures who the emirate fears are out to damage its relationship with Washington.</p> <p>Ironically, according to a researcher who has studied the increasingly prominent sorts of schemes like the one Solomon’s suit describes, the effect of all these email dumps may not be quite what their alleged sponsors hope.</p> <p>“The different Gulf states at that point on different sides of the Gulf crisis, split between Qatar and some of the others, were really trying to engage in U.S. politics in a big way, because securing U.S. political support for their side of the controversy was highly valuable,” says James Shires, a senior research fellow in cybersecurity at Chatham House in London, <a href=\"https://tnsr.org/2020/08/the-simulation-of-scandal-hack-and-leak-operations-the-gulf-states-and-u-s-politics/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tnsr.org/2020/08/the-simulation-of-scandal-hack-and-leak-operations-the-gulf-states-and-u-s-politics/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70ec000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2419-d0bf-a7a6-7e1b70ec000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019</a>, including the one that led to Solomon’s emails going public. “Some of the ways they tried to do this was to do hack-and-leak operations that smeared the other side. … This kind of backfired a lot.

It wasn’t actually Solomon’s email that was accessed — it was that of a source who had spent a career involved in sensitive work in what amounts to a bad geopolitical neighborhood.\n In the same way, the same month as Solomon’s firing, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, was the subject of a celebrated hack that led to the release of his correspondence with a variety of Washington players, many of whom had once assumed that they, too, lived in a safe world.\n “Jay and I came to the conclusion that we were both hit by the same mercenary hackers albeit hired by two different clients,” Otaiba told me this week.\n Indeed, the hostility between Iran and its Gulf neighbors, and the related standoff pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE, has a way of spilling into Washington controversies, from the downfall of Brookings Institution President John Allen (investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank, he was never charged but did lose his job, something that was cheered by many Beltway opponents of the emirate) to the release of emails of folks like Otaiba and Solomon (both of whom tend to be viewed with suspicion by many of Qatar’s stateside admirers and by folks in favor of rapprochement with Iran). The AP reported on Thursday that the FBI is probing an ex-CIA operative for allegedly spying on Qatar’s rivals, including U.S. figures who the emirate fears are out to damage its relationship with Washington.\n Ironically, according to a researcher who has studied the increasingly prominent sorts of schemes like the one Solomon’s suit describes, the effect of all these email dumps may not be quite what their alleged sponsors hope.\n “The different Gulf states at that point on different sides of the Gulf crisis, split between Qatar and some of the others, were really trying to engage in U.S. politics in a big way, because securing U.S. political support for their side of the controversy was highly valuable,” says James Shires, a senior research fellow in cybersecurity at Chatham House in London, who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019, including the one that led to Solomon’s emails going public. “Some of the ways they tried to do this was to do hack-and-leak operations that smeared the other side. … This kind of backfired a lot. When they got third parties to do the hacking and leaking, often either PR firms or law firms, the story became about the hack-and-leak operation, not the content of the leak.”","dc:creator":"Michael Schaffer","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/ab/dbd8f4ce47ccbd13b596e586ad25/capcity.Solomon.jpeg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/Photos by Reuters, iStock","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/ab/dbd8f4ce47ccbd13b596e586ad25/capcity.Solomon.jpeg"}}]},"content":"Jay Solomon claims that a major law firm and an array of others targeted him after he angered a Persian Gulf ruler.","contentSnippet":"Jay Solomon claims that a major law firm and an array of others targeted him after he angered a Persian Gulf ruler.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/28/reporter-suing-email-hack-fired-00063901","isoDate":"2022-10-28T08:30:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Kelly Garrity","title":"Biden to travel to Egypt for COP27 climate conference","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/28/biden-to-travel-to-egypt-for-cop27-00064094","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 18:43:41 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/d0/c6/51f64a484c8fb592474a31727a9c/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1437047091\"> <br> <p>President Joe Biden will attend the U.N.
