Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) haven’t set foot in the state since the summer. Former Vice President Mike Pence headlined a fundraiser for Republican Senate nominee Don Bolduc the day after the state’s Sept. 13 primary and never came back. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed both Republican House candidates but is nowhere to be seen.\n The cast of characters has dwindled on the Democratic side, too. President Joe Biden has been to reliably blue Massachusetts more times this year than to purple New Hampshire, which he last visited in April.\n “It’s confusing to me for a couple of reasons,” Republican consultant Mike Dennehy, who advised one of Bolduc’s primary rivals, said in an interview. “You have New Hampshire being one of the top U.S. Senate races in the country. And you have New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. So where are all the political celebrities?”\n Several polls show Bolduc’s race against Sen. Maggie Hassan within the margin of error. Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas’ contest against Karoline Leavitt, a former Trump White House press aide, is rated a toss-up.\n But Republican resources and Democratic attention have largely shifted to other states. Neighboring Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been helping Democrats in Oregon and elsewhere. Cruz, who campaigned for Leavitt ahead of the September primary and endorsed Bolduc earlier this month, has been spotted in recent days with Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker and North Carolina Republicans Ted Budd and Bo Hines instead.\n \n There are a few factors at play: Voters nominated a slate of hard-right, pro-Trump nominees against Hassan, Pappas and Rep. Annie Kuster, seemingly cutting the Democratic incumbents a break in a state Trump lost twice and complicating the endorsement calculus for those trying to distance themselves from the former president.\n Uncertainties also abound about the next presidential contest. Democrats are weighing whether to rejigger their primary calendar, potentially jeopardizing New Hampshire’s storied status. And the possibility of a 2024 rematch between Trump and Biden is casting a shadow over the primaries — potentially diminishing New Hampshire’s allure.\n “People are viewing New Hampshire as a limited pasture right now,” Patrick Griffin, a GOP strategist who’s been a media consultant on presidential campaigns and for Republicans’ Senate and House campaign arms, said in an interview.\n Some big names have still swung through. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard stumped for Bolduc this month — with Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who leads the Republican Senate campaign arm, expected to follow. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) and first lady Jill Biden have hit the trail for Hassan.\n Other Republicans — outgoing Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo among them — have come through for “Politics and Eggs,” the New Hampshire Institute of Politics and Saint Anselm College speaker series that’s a must-stop for presidential hopefuls. But they left without stumping for Bolduc, Leavitt or Bob Burns, who’s challenging Kuster. Pompeo recently endorsed Bolduc — as have Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) — but hasn’t campaigned with him in person.\n Then there’s closely watched Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, who hasn’t set foot here — despite some prodding.\n Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie came to New England this month — to campaign for Republican Allan Fung, who polls show has the edge in Rhode Island’s hotly contested congressional race. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who’s up for reelection in November, ran digital ads in New Hampshire and other early-voting states over the summer. But when she came east in August, it was to campaign for Massachusetts’ Republican gubernatorial nominee Geoff Diehl.\n There’s been a similar dearth of top-tier politicians on the Democratic side. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker headlined the state party’s convention in June — where Labor Secretary Marty Walsh also spoke — but has since been spending his time on his reelection bid and his money on candidates in other states. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg headlined a major party fundraising dinner in September. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was last here for a dinner in March.\n And those who have campaigned for Bolduc or Hassan have played coy about their future plans as they try to balance their own self-interests with those of Trump or Biden.\n \n  \n Booker joked while campaigning with Hassan and Pappas in a Derry coffee shop last week that he’d spent a lot of time in the state two years ago. He called himself “a guy who has a lot of love for the Granite State” and said he wants to keep it “at the top of our primary list.”\n But he also listed off the Biden administration’s legislative wins — including bipartisan infrastructure and gun safety bills — and said “I’m just one of those people who believe President Biden should run for reelection on that record.”\n Haley, the former Trump administration ambassador to the United Nations, didn’t acknowledge a reporter’s question earlier this month about potential dual motives about her trips to campaign for Bolduc.\n “He’s a veteran who just wants to see America get back to what she is, which is great. And I could not be more excited than to help him,” Haley said in response. “This is my second time coming, and if I need to come back, I’ll come back.”\n Other Republican visitors to New Hampshire have been more open about their ambitions. Pompeo said his September visit for “Politics and Eggs” was “not random.” A month later he told CBS News he’ll make a decision by the spring on whether to run for president — regardless of Trump.\n Jim Demers, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic operative and lobbyist who backed Booker in 2020 before moving to Biden, said in an interview that “the big difference here is the Republican candidates or elected officials who are coming here are very clear that they’re testing the waters for 2024.”\n Democrats, he said, “are coming here — I think most of them — with an expectation that President Biden is going to run again.”\n But, Demers said as he watched Booker, Hassan and Pappas make their rounds in the small Derry coffee shop, if Biden “decides not to run, they’ve laid a little foundation.”","dc:creator":"Lisa Kashinsky","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/fa/5e/b6a6e8d64ffa9f73fb8f4a35a05f/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/621776142"},"media:credit":[{"_":"John Moore/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"“You have New Hampshire being one of the top U.S. Senate races in the country.

Someday, perhaps, we will have an election in which people say, “You know, this one is actually not that big a deal — there’s little at stake either way.” Still, this year — with Donald Trump’s past, present and future still looming over all American politics — does genuinely qualify as consequential. Which means the after-election ruminations will similarly be among the most consequential.</p> <p>Two, Democrats are genuinely confronting a political moment that for most defies comprehension. As Nancy Pelosi put it in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/pelosi-democrats-midterms.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;interview with the New York Times&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/pelosi-democrats-midterms.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89410000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89410001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">interview with the New York Times</a>, explaining her against-the-current optimism: “Part of it is, I can’t believe anybody would vote for these people.”</p> <p>In the 30 years that I have been covering politics, one constant was that people in both major parties had the same envious complaint about the other: <i>We are too principled for our own good. The opposition is just better at being ruthless than we are.</i></p> <p>What has changed in recent years is the end of equivalence. It is inconceivable to imagine any Democratic politician in modern times having such a grip on supporters that he or she would remain an unchallenged leader after losing an election or being under multiple simultaneous criminal investigations.</p> <p>The possibility that two seismic events — the revelations of the Jan. 6 committee about Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, and the Supreme Court’s June decision to revoke a constitutional right to abortion — might not reshape the political landscape in Democrats’ favor puts the question in the starkest light: What will it take to change the fundamentals?</p> <p>One answer is that Democrats perhaps shouldn’t be so hard on themselves, even if they lose congressional control. Since World War II, the party holding the White House has lost seats in every midterm election, except in 1998 (amid backlash to the Bill Clinton impeachment) and 2002 (with George W. Bush still commanding support a year after 9/11). It is only because Democrats last summer allowed expectations that 2022 would be another of those anomalous years to soar that the likely return of old patterns is so jarring.</p> <p>But another answer is that 2022 is in fact a year of useful experiments for Democrats. For decades, progressives like Sanders have argued that voters want a choice, not an echo — that drawing sharp stylistic lines and advocating an ambitious liberal agenda would motivate voters more effectively than play-it-safe centrism.</p> <p>Democrat John Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania against Trump-backed television physician Mehmet Oz, as well as Democrat Mandela Barnes’s effort to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, both offer good tests of the hypothesis. As both contests have become more challenging for Democrats, some allies of Barnes and Fetterman have complained of ineffective support from establishment Democrats in Washington.</p> <p>Also facing a severe test is the long-time belief among many Democrats that demography is destiny — that as the country becomes more diverse, a multiracial coalition would inevitably yield huge benefits for progressive candidates. In Nevada, however, a state with a large and growing Hispanic population, a Democratic incumbent, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whose mother was a Mexican immigrant, is in a close race against Republican Adam Laxalt, a Trump-backer who has challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election.</p> <p>Above all, the Democratic post-election analysis will have large implications for President Joseph Biden. Legislative victories and modestly improved poll numbers last summer quieted widespread grumbling among Democrats that he might be too old or too weakened to be the best Democratic nominee in 2024, especially if the outcome of losing is Trump’s return to the White House. This stewing will return in force if Democrats have especially weak midterms, in which an unpopular president was simply not welcome in many key races.</p> <p>Of course, it is not just Democrats who will be facing post-mortems. If Republicans fail to take the Senate, there will be widespread recriminations over candidate choices in several states, including Pennsylvania if Oz loses, and also in Georgia, where former football star Herschel Walker has run a stumbling campaign beset by allegations over his personal life.</p> <p>Amid all this fluidity, there is one reliable constant. Post-election debates are always a way of returning to arguments that the debaters have been waging for years. Just as no one ever says any election is unimportant, there has never been a documented case of an operative or election analyst saying, “Unfortunately, these results show that premises I have articulated for years now are just not true. I’m not sure what to say about the results except that I have been wrong about everything.”</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Twelve days before the election, Democrats have yet to lose the House or Senate, or confront the dire, your-lab-results-are-back-and-the-doctor-needs-to-see-you implications for a progressive agenda.\n Plenty of prominent party voices, however, believe it’s best to prepare in advance.

Someday, perhaps, we will have an election in which people say, “You know, this one is actually not that big a deal — there’s little at stake either way.” Still, this year — with Donald Trump’s past, present and future still looming over all American politics — does genuinely qualify as consequential. Which means the after-election ruminations will similarly be among the most consequential.\n Two, Democrats are genuinely confronting a political moment that for most defies comprehension. As Nancy Pelosi put it in an interview with the New York Times, explaining her against-the-current optimism: “Part of it is, I can’t believe anybody would vote for these people.”\n In the 30 years that I have been covering politics, one constant was that people in both major parties had the same envious complaint about the other: We are too principled for our own good. The opposition is just better at being ruthless than we are.\n What has changed in recent years is the end of equivalence. It is inconceivable to imagine any Democratic politician in modern times having such a grip on supporters that he or she would remain an unchallenged leader after losing an election or being under multiple simultaneous criminal investigations.\n The possibility that two seismic events — the revelations of the Jan. 6 committee about Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, and the Supreme Court’s June decision to revoke a constitutional right to abortion — might not reshape the political landscape in Democrats’ favor puts the question in the starkest light: What will it take to change the fundamentals?\n One answer is that Democrats perhaps shouldn’t be so hard on themselves, even if they lose congressional control. Since World War II, the party holding the White House has lost seats in every midterm election, except in 1998 (amid backlash to the Bill Clinton impeachment) and 2002 (with George W. Bush still commanding support a year after 9/11). It is only because Democrats last summer allowed expectations that 2022 would be another of those anomalous years to soar that the likely return of old patterns is so jarring.\n But another answer is that 2022 is in fact a year of useful experiments for Democrats. For decades, progressives like Sanders have argued that voters want a choice, not an echo — that drawing sharp stylistic lines and advocating an ambitious liberal agenda would motivate voters more effectively than play-it-safe centrism.\n Democrat John Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania against Trump-backed television physician Mehmet Oz, as well as Democrat Mandela Barnes’s effort to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, both offer good tests of the hypothesis. As both contests have become more challenging for Democrats, some allies of Barnes and Fetterman have complained of ineffective support from establishment Democrats in Washington.\n Also facing a severe test is the long-time belief among many Democrats that demography is destiny — that as the country becomes more diverse, a multiracial coalition would inevitably yield huge benefits for progressive candidates. In Nevada, however, a state with a large and growing Hispanic population, a Democratic incumbent, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whose mother was a Mexican immigrant, is in a close race against Republican Adam Laxalt, a Trump-backer who has challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n Above all, the Democratic post-election analysis will have large implications for President Joseph Biden. Legislative victories and modestly improved poll numbers last summer quieted widespread grumbling among Democrats that he might be too old or too weakened to be the best Democratic nominee in 2024, especially if the outcome of losing is Trump’s return to the White House. This stewing will return in force if Democrats have especially weak midterms, in which an unpopular president was simply not welcome in many key races.\n Of course, it is not just Democrats who will be facing post-mortems. If Republicans fail to take the Senate, there will be widespread recriminations over candidate choices in several states, including Pennsylvania if Oz loses, and also in Georgia, where former football star Herschel Walker has run a stumbling campaign beset by allegations over his personal life.\n Amid all this fluidity, there is one reliable constant. Post-election debates are always a way of returning to arguments that the debaters have been waging for years. Just as no one ever says any election is unimportant, there has never been a documented case of an operative or election analyst saying, “Unfortunately, these results show that premises I have articulated for years now are just not true. I’m not sure what to say about the results except that I have been wrong about everything.”","dc:creator":"John F.

He had retired after the 1956 season but was still hugely popular, having broken baseball’s color barrier 13 years earlier. And he had a decision to make: Who was he going to back in the presidential election that fall?</p> <p>Robinson’s endorsement was so valuable that both John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon personally courted him. And in turn, the baseball icon vetted each candidate, hard. As the election approached, he met with both men on the same day, a kind of job interview for his support.</p> <p>Robinson was an active supporter of the civil rights movement, and most Black Americans backed Kennedy. But Robinson had signaled early in 1960 that Democrats shouldn’t take Blacks’ support for granted. While his first choice for president had been a Democrat, civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey, Robinson made it clear that he was intrigued by Nixon as well.</p> <p>“Though the Democratic nominee is still undetermined at this point, it would be folly to underestimate the impression Nixon’s generally good civil rights record has made among Negroes,” Robinson wrote in a column published in the <i>Chicago Defender</i>, a Black newspaper, in January 1960. “I’ve been following Nixon’s career for some time now, and I don’t mind admitting that generally I’ve liked what I’ve seen and heard.”</p> <p>Robinson added that while Nixon’s record wasn’t as good as Humphrey’s, it was still “very attractive” compared to other Democratic candidates. “Many people whom I’ve talked with, whose first concern is civil rights, would not hesitate to support Vice President Nixon.”</p> <p>Robinson recognized that liberals disliked Nixon for how he had trashed his Democratic opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in his victorious 1950 Senate election. And, as he acknowledged in his autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>I Never Had It Made</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>I Never Had It Made</i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>“there was a great deal of suspicion in the black community about Nixon.” But he defended the vice president, writing that “in the years he’s been prominent in national affairs, Mr. Nixon has grown more than any other person presently in political life.”</p> <p>At the time, the parties were not as ideologically uniform as they are today — there were liberal Republicans and Democratic segregationists. And Robinson wasn’t ready to commit to Democrats if they didn’t nominate Humphrey, which they didn’t, leaving Robinson with a tough choice: Pick an untested Democrat or openly flout the preference of the Black community and support the Republican.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/0f/04/dba78e5a4a51aab785da8e16acf5/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>So, a few weeks before the mid-July Democratic National Convention, Robinson had his doubleheader of meetings with Nixon and Kennedy.</p> <p>In Nixon’s office, the vice president “said all the right things,” Robinson recalled in his autobiography. However, he was put off when he heard Nixon take a call and say, “No, well, I can’t do that. I’m tired of pulling his chestnuts out of this fire. He’ll have to work his own way out of this one.” After hanging up, Nixon told Robinson he had been talking about President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “It sounded as if the Vice President wanted me to disassociate him from Eisenhower since he knew that blacks, in the main, didn’t like Ike,” Robinson wrote. “It had the feel of a cheap trick.”</p> <p>But he had a much worse impression of Kennedy, whom he met with at a private home in Washington later that day.</p> <p>“My very first reaction to the Senator was one of doubt because he couldn’t or wouldn’t look me straight in the eye,” Robinson recalled, and he wound up writing a letter to JFK suggesting he do so in the future.</p> <p>“My second reaction, much more substantial, was that this was a man who had served in the Senate and wanted to be President but who knew little or nothing about black problems and sensibilities.

The two men were around the same age — Nixon was born six years earlier, in 1913 — and they both grew up in California, although under far different circumstances.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e9/9a/355b4ca64360b5f1655d69bd4e2d/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>By 1957, a year after Robinson retired, he was praising Nixon for a speech in Ethiopia in which the vice president declared that the U.S. will never be satisfied until all Americans have equal opportunity. “In this endeavor,” Robinson wrote in one of many letters to Nixon, “you have my best wishes and steadfast cooperation.”</p> <p>“Dear Jackie,” Nixon replied. “As you can imagine, there were a number of letters on my desk when I returned to the office today after an absence of three weeks. I can assure you, however, that there were none which meant more to me than your thoughtful letter of March 19.” He called it a “privilege” to be working with Robinson “to achieve the important objective of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all Americans, and your expression of approval will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to me.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>So Nixon had built up</b> a groundswell of goodwill with Robinson in the years leading up to the 1960 election. But he soon squandered it.</p> <p>A key incident took place in October 1960, when Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed in Georgia. Nixon sat on his hands while the Kennedy campaign acted decisively. JFK called King’s wife, Coretta, to express support, and worked behind the scenes to press for King’s release. After he was freed, King publicly thanked JFK for his role and pointedly said he hadn’t heard from Nixon.</p> <p>At the Nixon campaign, Robinson had pushed for a robust response from his candidate.</p> <p>“He has to do this,” Robinson said at the time, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;1987 Safire column&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">1987 Safire column</a> in the <i>New York Times</i>. “He has to call Martin right now, today. I have the number of the jail.” Safire said he brought Robinson to the campaign manager, who then escorted him to see Nixon.</p> <p>“Ten minutes later, he came out, tears of frustration in his eyes,” Safire wrote. “‘He thinks calling Martin would be ‘grandstanding,’ Robinson reported. ‘Nixon doesn't deserve to win.’”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2e/1e/da486c2d46e5b02ad758943af421/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary4.png\"> <br> <p>In his autobiography, Robinson recalled: “I was in the behind-the-scenes struggle to persuade Dick Nixon to express his concern for Dr. King, but apparently his most trusted advisors were counseling him not to rock the racial boat. Add to this fact that Mr. Nixon refused to campaign in Harlem as his opponent did, and it is easy to understand why blacks overwhelmingly voted for Kennedy.”</p> <p>Despite his anger with Nixon, Robinson resisted entreaties from his wife and friends to switch sides.</p> <p>“It’s hard to explain why I stuck, disillusioned as I was,” he wrote. “It had something to do with stubbornness about continuing to want to believe in people even when everything indicates that they are no longer worthy of support.” He said he clung to the hope that Nixon would follow through on what he said at their meeting once the pressure of the campaign was over.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Nixon lost</b> and Robinson began to warm to President Kennedy after initially calling him out for a lack of progress on civil rights. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Robinson still supported a Republican, albeit a moderate one, for president in 1964 — Rockefeller, the New York governor — but this time with his eyes a bit more open.</p> <p>“I wasn’t about to be taken in instantly by the Nelson Rockefeller charm,” Robinson said. “After all, Richard Nixon had turned the charm on me too (although his is a bit more brittle compared with Rockefeller’s) and look how that had worked out.”</p> <p>And Robinson made a distinction between Rockefeller and the rest of the GOP: “I was not as sold on the Republican party as I was on the governor. Every chance I got, while I was campaigning, I said plainly what I thought of the right-wing Republicans and the harm they were doing.”</p> <p>Around this time, Robinson was also calling out Black militants such as Malcolm X, including in a November 1963 <i>Chicago Defender</i> column. Malcolm X replied in a Dec. 7 column in the same publication, addressed to “Dear Good Friend, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson”:</p> <p><i>Aren’t you the same ex-baseball player who tried to “mislead” Negroes in Nixon’s camp during the last presidential election? Evidently, you were the only Negro who voted for Nixon, because according to the polls taken afterward, very few Negroes were dumb enough to follow your “mislead.” … You never give up. You are now trying to lead Negroes into Nelson Rockefeller’s camp.</i></p> <p>Robinson went to the ’64 Republican National Convention in San Francisco as a special delegate, which he called “one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life.” Those were particularly striking words from a man who had endured death threats, hate mail and other abuse after debuting with the Dodgers in 1947.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6c/86/5e206af94660bcf7b7563ce3d720/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>“A new breed of Republican had taken over the GOP,” he wrote. “As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco, I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.”</p> <p>When he cheered on his candidate — shouting “‘C’mon, Rocky!’” — an angry Alabama delegate turned “menacingly” toward him, but the man’s wife held him back. Robinson, who early in his career was forced to turn the other check in the face of white infielders spiking him and white pitchers throwing at his head, had no such restraints now: “‘Turn him loose, lady, turn him loose!’ I shouted. I was ready for him. I wanted him badly, but luckily for him he obeyed his wife.”</p> <p>The Republicans nominated archconservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He’d also written off the Black vote, saying, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.” Robinson denounced him as a bigot and joined “Republicans for Johnson” — working to reelect Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who won in a landslide.<br></p> <br> <p><b>In 1966, Robinson went to work</b> for Rockefeller as a special assistant to the governor for community affairs, then backed him again in the 1968 presidential election, when Nixon staged a comeback. California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged both candidates from the right, and when Robinson heard about reports of a possible Rockefeller-Reagan ticket to block Nixon, he told the New York governor he could never support that.</p> <p>With a laugh, Rockefeller replied: “You should have heard the hard time I had explaining <i>you</i> to Reagan.”</p> <p>After Republicans nominated Nixon for president, Robinson said he realized that the party didn’t care about him or his people.</p> <p>“The Republican Party has told the black man to go to hell. I offer to them a similar invitation,” Robinson wrote in his “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America” column, published by the <i>Chicago Defender</i> in 1968.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/a4/5c/1dbffd6040c3a367ddee72fd5a6d/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p>Still just 49, Robinson suffered a heart attack that year, and skipped the GOP convention on doctor’s orders — which he said was for the best.</p> <p>“It was a white folks affair and the once Grand Old Party’s new caretakers, under Richard Nixon, leaned over backwards to give Dixie some Southern comfort,” Robinson wrote, calling the party “insensitive and stupid” for choosing Nixon over Rockefeller.</p> <p>“They deserved the man they got — a two-time loser, an adjustable man with a convertible conscience — Richard Nixon.”</p> <p>Robinson quit his job with the Rockefeller administration and endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate, Humphrey, by now LBJ’s vice president. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1968/08/15/archives/politics-humphrey-urges-speech-limit-and-end-to-convention.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;At a joint appearance in Harlem&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1968/08/15/archives/politics-humphrey-urges-speech-limit-and-end-to-convention.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">At a joint appearance in Harlem</a>, a small group of African Americans heckled both men, one yelling “that Uncle Tom” Robinson should leave along with Humphrey.</p> <p>This time, Nixon won in a close election as the Democratic Party splintered.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Even after turning away from Nixon, </b>Robinson continued to correspond with him. In a 1970 letter republished in his autobiography, Robinson criticized the president for selecting “enemies” of the Black community as his top advisers. He singled out Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who had run for president in 1948 as a “Dixiecrat” and had played a key role at the ’68 GOP convention; Attorney General John Mitchell; and Vice President Spiro Agnew.</p> <p>“You would not support known anti-Semites to placate Jewish feelings. Why appoint known segregationists to deal with black problems?” he asked Nixon.</p> <p>Nixon replied in an anodyne note thanking Robinson for his “thoughtful letter” — the same phrase he had used in responding to the former ballplayer in 1957. “All I can hope,” the president wrote, “is that by my acts and those of the men who I have chosen to help set polices, I can earn the respect and the friendship of Black America.”</p> <p>In another letter, Robinson told Nixon he could never support his reelection as long as Agnew was on the ticket: “I feel so strongly about his being anti-black and anti-progressive in race relations that I dread the fact of anything happening to you and Mr. Agnew becoming President of the United States.”</p> <p>(Of course, Nixon did wind up resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but Agnew resigned before that, sparing the nation a President Agnew.)</p> <p>Perhaps no sentiment better captured Robinson’s disillusionment with Nixon than his March 21, 1972, letter to Nixon, after the president proposed restrictions on school busing, which was a contentious issue at the time. In a nationwide televised address, Nixon declared: “I am opposed to busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance in our schools.”</p> <p>Robinson told Nixon he was wrong to suggest Black Americans wanted busing to achieve racial balance. “We want busing so our children can compete!” he wrote, and accused the president of “polarizing this country.”</p> <p>And yet he expressed a glimmer of hope for his onetime ally.</p> <p>“Because I want so much to be a part of and to love this country as I once did,” he concluded, “I hope you will take another look at where we are going and be the president who leads the nation to accept difficult but necessary action, rather than one who fosters division.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fb/f4/e0b3d5d249c4807b17d14b9326d6/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p>In July 1972, Nixon selected Robinson as the “best all-around athlete” in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/07/01/richard-nixon-baseball-all-time-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;president’s all-time baseball list&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/07/01/richard-nixon-baseball-all-time-teams/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">president’s all-time baseball list</a>.

Kennedy for the presidency in 1960 one of my finest ones,” Robinson wrote. “It was a sincere one, however, at the time. The Richard Nixon I met back in 1960 bore no resemblance to the Richard Nixon as President.”<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"In the summer of 1960, Jackie Robinson was one of the most prominent ex-athletes in America. He had retired after the 1956 season but was still hugely popular, having broken baseball’s color barrier 13 years earlier. And he had a decision to make: Who was he going to back in the presidential election that fall?\n Robinson’s endorsement was so valuable that both John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon personally courted him. And in turn, the baseball icon vetted each candidate, hard. As the election approached, he met with both men on the same day, a kind of job interview for his support.\n Robinson was an active supporter of the civil rights movement, and most Black Americans backed Kennedy. But Robinson had signaled early in 1960 that Democrats shouldn’t take Blacks’ support for granted. While his first choice for president had been a Democrat, civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey, Robinson made it clear that he was intrigued by Nixon as well.\n “Though the Democratic nominee is still undetermined at this point, it would be folly to underestimate the impression Nixon’s generally good civil rights record has made among Negroes,” Robinson wrote in a column published in the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper, in January 1960. “I’ve been following Nixon’s career for some time now, and I don’t mind admitting that generally I’ve liked what I’ve seen and heard.”\n Robinson added that while Nixon’s record wasn’t as good as Humphrey’s, it was still “very attractive” compared to other Democratic candidates. “Many people whom I’ve talked with, whose first concern is civil rights, would not hesitate to support Vice President Nixon.”\n Robinson recognized that liberals disliked Nixon for how he had trashed his Democratic opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in his victorious 1950 Senate election. And, as he acknowledged in his autobiography, I Never Had It Made\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890a0001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">I Never Had It Made, “there was a great deal of suspicion in the black community about Nixon.” But he defended the vice president, writing that “in the years he’s been prominent in national affairs, Mr. Nixon has grown more than any other person presently in political life.”\n At the time, the parties were not as ideologically uniform as they are today — there were liberal Republicans and Democratic segregationists. And Robinson wasn’t ready to commit to Democrats if they didn’t nominate Humphrey, which they didn’t, leaving Robinson with a tough choice: Pick an untested Democrat or openly flout the preference of the Black community and support the Republican.\n \n  \n So, a few weeks before the mid-July Democratic National Convention, Robinson had his doubleheader of meetings with Nixon and Kennedy.\n In Nixon’s office, the vice president “said all the right things,” Robinson recalled in his autobiography. However, he was put off when he heard Nixon take a call and say, “No, well, I can’t do that. I’m tired of pulling his chestnuts out of this fire. He’ll have to work his own way out of this one.” After hanging up, Nixon told Robinson he had been talking about President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “It sounded as if the Vice President wanted me to disassociate him from Eisenhower since he knew that blacks, in the main, didn’t like Ike,” Robinson wrote. “It had the feel of a cheap trick.”\n But he had a much worse impression of Kennedy, whom he met with at a private home in Washington later that day.\n “My very first reaction to the Senator was one of doubt because he couldn’t or wouldn’t look me straight in the eye,” Robinson recalled, and he wound up writing a letter to JFK suggesting he do so in the future.\n “My second reaction, much more substantial, was that this was a man who had served in the Senate and wanted to be President but who knew little or nothing about black problems and sensibilities. He himself admitted a lack of any depth of understanding about black people … I was appalled that he could be so ignorant of our situation and be bidding for the highest office in the land.”\n That did it. Jackie Robinson chose Richard Nixon.\n \n He told the leaders at Washington’s African Methodist Church that he asked the same questions of both candidates, and while Nixon gave straightforward answers, “I had to challenge Kennedy six times.”\n Robinson’s decision to support Nixon was controversial. It earned him the enmity of some Black leaders, including Malcolm X, but Robinson didn’t waver. Later, he would even support another Republican for president, moderate Nelson Rockefeller.\n “That was a pretty gutsy thing for him to do, considering the entire black establishment was behind John F. Kennedy, but Jackie Robinson had unique experience in breaking through in the white world,” recalled William Safire, a young Nixon aide at the time. “The athlete with the greatest positive influence on black-white relations since the boxer Joe Louis was not the sort to flinch at being called an Uncle Tom for supporting a Republican.”\n It was also a decision Robinson came to regret.\n In the coming years, he became disillusioned not just with Nixon, but with the Republican Party. The GOP had moved steadily to the right through the turbulent 1960s, embracing a strategy of pandering to Southern whites that threatened civil rights gains spearheaded by the Democrats. When Nixon sought the presidency again eight years later, Robinson denounced him in a column headlined, “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America.” Robinson would die in 1972, half a century before the reactionary forces he saw emerging ultimately came to dominate the GOP.\n \n The relationship between Nixon and Robinson dated back to 1952, when Robinson was a star player in his prime and Nixon was a U.S. senator running as Eisenhower’s vice presidential running mate, on their way to winning the White House.\n Nixon was a huge sports fan and something of a fanboy, and had a hard time curbing his enthusiasm when he met Robinson at that year’s Republican National Convention in Chicago. According to Harrison McCall, president of the California Republican Assembly, who introduced the two men, Nixon told Robinson about first seeing him compete in a UCLA football game in 1939 — and about a specific play that stood out all these years later.\n “I said to Nixon as we walked away that, while Robinson had undoubtedly met a lot of notables in his career, nevertheless I was sure there was one person he would never forget,” McCall said.\n Nixon also watched Robinson play for the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field, including the World Series that fall, which the New York Yankees won in seven games. The two men were around the same age — Nixon was born six years earlier, in 1913 — and they both grew up in California, although under far different circumstances.\n \n  \n By 1957, a year after Robinson retired, he was praising Nixon for a speech in Ethiopia in which the vice president declared that the U.S. will never be satisfied until all Americans have equal opportunity. “In this endeavor,” Robinson wrote in one of many letters to Nixon, “you have my best wishes and steadfast cooperation.”\n “Dear Jackie,” Nixon replied. “As you can imagine, there were a number of letters on my desk when I returned to the office today after an absence of three weeks. I can assure you, however, that there were none which meant more to me than your thoughtful letter of March 19.” He called it a “privilege” to be working with Robinson “to achieve the important objective of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all Americans, and your expression of approval will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to me.”\n \n So Nixon had built up a groundswell of goodwill with Robinson in the years leading up to the 1960 election. But he soon squandered it.\n A key incident took place in October 1960, when Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed in Georgia. Nixon sat on his hands while the Kennedy campaign acted decisively. JFK called King’s wife, Coretta, to express support, and worked behind the scenes to press for King’s release. After he was freed, King publicly thanked JFK for his role and pointedly said he hadn’t heard from Nixon.\n At the Nixon campaign, Robinson had pushed for a robust response from his candidate.\n “He has to do this,” Robinson said at the time, according to a 1987 Safire column in the New York Times. “He has to call Martin right now, today. I have the number of the jail.” Safire said he brought Robinson to the campaign manager, who then escorted him to see Nixon.\n “Ten minutes later, he came out, tears of frustration in his eyes,” Safire wrote. “‘He thinks calling Martin would be ‘grandstanding,’ Robinson reported. ‘Nixon doesn't deserve to win.’”\n \n  \n In his autobiography, Robinson recalled: “I was in the behind-the-scenes struggle to persuade Dick Nixon to express his concern for Dr. King, but apparently his most trusted advisors were counseling him not to rock the racial boat. Add to this fact that Mr. Nixon refused to campaign in Harlem as his opponent did, and it is easy to understand why blacks overwhelmingly voted for Kennedy.”\n Despite his anger with Nixon, Robinson resisted entreaties from his wife and friends to switch sides.\n “It’s hard to explain why I stuck, disillusioned as I was,” he wrote. “It had something to do with stubbornness about continuing to want to believe in people even when everything indicates that they are no longer worthy of support.” He said he clung to the hope that Nixon would follow through on what he said at their meeting once the pressure of the campaign was over.\n \n Nixon lost and Robinson began to warm to President Kennedy after initially calling him out for a lack of progress on civil rights. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Robinson still supported a Republican, albeit a moderate one, for president in 1964 — Rockefeller, the New York governor — but this time with his eyes a bit more open.\n “I wasn’t about to be taken in instantly by the Nelson Rockefeller charm,” Robinson said. “After all, Richard Nixon had turned the charm on me too (although his is a bit more brittle compared with Rockefeller’s) and look how that had worked out.”\n And Robinson made a distinction between Rockefeller and the rest of the GOP: “I was not as sold on the Republican party as I was on the governor. Every chance I got, while I was campaigning, I said plainly what I thought of the right-wing Republicans and the harm they were doing.”\n Around this time, Robinson was also calling out Black militants such as Malcolm X, including in a November 1963 Chicago Defender column. Malcolm X replied in a Dec. 7 column in the same publication, addressed to “Dear Good Friend, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson”:\n Aren’t you the same ex-baseball player who tried to “mislead” Negroes in Nixon’s camp during the last presidential election? Evidently, you were the only Negro who voted for Nixon, because according to the polls taken afterward, very few Negroes were dumb enough to follow your “mislead.” … You never give up. You are now trying to lead Negroes into Nelson Rockefeller’s camp.\n Robinson went to the ’64 Republican National Convention in San Francisco as a special delegate, which he called “one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life.” Those were particularly striking words from a man who had endured death threats, hate mail and other abuse after debuting with the Dodgers in 1947.\n \n  \n “A new breed of Republican had taken over the GOP,” he wrote. “As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco, I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.”\n When he cheered on his candidate — shouting “‘C’mon, Rocky!’” — an angry Alabama delegate turned “menacingly” toward him, but the man’s wife held him back. Robinson, who early in his career was forced to turn the other check in the face of white infielders spiking him and white pitchers throwing at his head, had no such restraints now: “‘Turn him loose, lady, turn him loose!’ I shouted. I was ready for him. I wanted him badly, but luckily for him he obeyed his wife.”\n The Republicans nominated archconservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He’d also written off the Black vote, saying, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.” Robinson denounced him as a bigot and joined “Republicans for Johnson” — working to reelect Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who won in a landslide.\n \n In 1966, Robinson went to work for Rockefeller as a special assistant to the governor for community affairs, then backed him again in the 1968 presidential election, when Nixon staged a comeback. California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged both candidates from the right, and when Robinson heard about reports of a possible Rockefeller-Reagan ticket to block Nixon, he told the New York governor he could never support that.\n With a laugh, Rockefeller replied: “You should have heard the hard time I had explaining you to Reagan.”\n After Republicans nominated Nixon for president, Robinson said he realized that the party didn’t care about him or his people.\n “The Republican Party has told the black man to go to hell. I offer to them a similar invitation,” Robinson wrote in his “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America” column, published by the Chicago Defender in 1968.\n \n  \n Still just 49, Robinson suffered a heart attack that year, and skipped the GOP convention on doctor’s orders — which he said was for the best.\n “It was a white folks affair and the once Grand Old Party’s new caretakers, under Richard Nixon, leaned over backwards to give Dixie some Southern comfort,” Robinson wrote, calling the party “insensitive and stupid” for choosing Nixon over Rockefeller.\n “They deserved the man they got — a two-time loser, an adjustable man with a convertible conscience — Richard Nixon.”\n Robinson quit his job with the Rockefeller administration and endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate, Humphrey, by now LBJ’s vice president. At a joint appearance in Harlem, a small group of African Americans heckled both men, one yelling “that Uncle Tom” Robinson should leave along with Humphrey.\n This time, Nixon won in a close election as the Democratic Party splintered.\n \n Even after turning away from Nixon, Robinson continued to correspond with him. In a 1970 letter republished in his autobiography, Robinson criticized the president for selecting “enemies” of the Black community as his top advisers. He singled out Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who had run for president in 1948 as a “Dixiecrat” and had played a key role at the ’68 GOP convention; Attorney General John Mitchell; and Vice President Spiro Agnew.\n “You would not support known anti-Semites to placate Jewish feelings. Why appoint known segregationists to deal with black problems?” he asked Nixon.\n Nixon replied in an anodyne note thanking Robinson for his “thoughtful letter” — the same phrase he had used in responding to the former ballplayer in 1957. “All I can hope,” the president wrote, “is that by my acts and those of the men who I have chosen to help set polices, I can earn the respect and the friendship of Black America.”\n In another letter, Robinson told Nixon he could never support his reelection as long as Agnew was on the ticket: “I feel so strongly about his being anti-black and anti-progressive in race relations that I dread the fact of anything happening to you and Mr. Agnew becoming President of the United States.”\n (Of course, Nixon did wind up resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but Agnew resigned before that, sparing the nation a President Agnew.)\n Perhaps no sentiment better captured Robinson’s disillusionment with Nixon than his March 21, 1972, letter to Nixon, after the president proposed restrictions on school busing, which was a contentious issue at the time. In a nationwide televised address, Nixon declared: “I am opposed to busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance in our schools.”\n Robinson told Nixon he was wrong to suggest Black Americans wanted busing to achieve racial balance. “We want busing so our children can compete!” he wrote, and accused the president of “polarizing this country.”\n And yet he expressed a glimmer of hope for his onetime ally.\n “Because I want so much to be a part of and to love this country as I once did,” he concluded, “I hope you will take another look at where we are going and be the president who leads the nation to accept difficult but necessary action, rather than one who fosters division.”\n \n  \n In July 1972, Nixon selected Robinson as the “best all-around athlete” in the president’s all-time baseball list. Initially, Robinson said, “I’m honored that he thought of me that way.” But a week later, he had reconsidered, saying, “I mean, how many games has Nixon actually seen?” Robinson surely knew that Nixon had seen quite a few games, but his comment showed how much contempt he had for the president by then.\n Still, Nixon continued to praise Robinson, perhaps in an effort to try to associate himself with a beloved national figure.\n On Oct. 15, 1972, just nine days before Robinson’s death, Major League Baseball honored him at a World Series event commemorating the 25th anniversary of him breaking the color barrier. Robinson, suffering from diabetes and blind in one eye, used the occasion to challenge baseball owners to hire a Black manager. Nixon sent a telegram that was read aloud by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn.\n “Baseball has known many moments of greatness in its long history,” Nixon wrote. “But none have been as significant or compelling as that April 15 afternoon, 25 years ago, when Jackie Robinson and eight other Dodgers took the field for his appearance at first base.”\n Robinson died on Oct. 24, 1972, at the age of 53. The White House sent a 40-person delegation to Robinson’s memorial service in New York three days later, but the president did not attend himself.\n Robinson ultimately got the final word on their relationship in his autobiography I Never Had It Made\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890b0004\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890b0005\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">I Never Had It Made, which was published soon after his death as Nixon was cruising to a landslide reelection victory.\n “I do not consider my decision to back Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy for the presidency in 1960 one of my finest ones,” Robinson wrote. “It was a sincere one, however, at the time. The Richard Nixon I met back in 1960 bore no resemblance to the Richard Nixon as President.”","dc:creator":"Frederic J.

Nixon had stoked the economy and forecast “peace with honor” in Vietnam. Only the trifling cloud called Watergate shadowed the president’s expected victory.</p> <p>All of which placed Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts under intense pressure. His Judiciary Committee investigators had corralled a witness who, given the drama of a public hearing, an eager media and the dazzle of the Kennedy name, could shatter the Watergate cover up and breathe new life into McGovern’s campaign.<br></p> <br> <p>“A giant fraud is being perpetrated upon the American people, and anyone who has it within his power to help expose that fraud has a responsibility to the public and to himself to do so as soon and as dramatically as possible,” one of Kennedy’s advisers contended in a memo to the senator.</p> <p>But a man-to-man showdown with Nixon would raise the issue of Kennedy’s own scandalous behavior. Only three years had passed since the night on Chappaquiddick, when he drove his car off an unmarked bridge and cost Mary Jo Kopechne her life. And it could be seen as partisan hatchetry.</p> <p>“I think the public should get as many facts as possible before the election, but I see no reason why we have to be the ones who do it … if our doing it is going to raise a serious collateral issue,” another aide responded.</p> <p>In the end, not for the first or last time in a storied career, Ted Kennedy’s private failings afflicted his public performance. He held no hearings in that election season. Nixon carried 49 states.</p> <p>In the hyper-partisan era of Donald Trump, the notion of a politician’s personal shortcomings hurting their political chances seems quaint. Far from disqualifying him, the 45<sup>th</sup> president’s litany of controversies — from shady business practices to the Billy Bush tape — seemed to boost his image and excite his base. Even now, following the events of January 6, Trump remains the de facto leader (and presumptive 2024 nominee) of the GOP.</p> <p>But as Ted Kennedy’s career shows, politics did not always operate this way. At key junctions in American history, his vulnerability on issues of personal character kept him from acting on public policy. His silence during the hearings over Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a classic example.</p> <p>Now, thanks to the unheralded release of a Senate Judiciary Committee file on Watergate that was improperly withheld from the public for decades, we have another case in point. This is the untold story of why Kennedy declined to stage what one aide described as “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions” and, to the dismay of fellow Democrats, dawdled as Nixon coasted to a landslide reelection.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Kennedy’s career has </b>many might-have-beens. The most widely known occurred in 1991, when one of his investigators, Ricki Seidman, was the first Senate aide to speak to Anita Hill and hear her allegation that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the years before his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p> <p>Kennedy had played a leading role in defeating another conservative nominee to the high court — Judge Robert Bork — in 1987, but now was in no shape to question Thomas’ behavior. The senator was ensnared by scandal that spring and summer after he woke his son and nephew for some late-night carousing in Palm Beach, Fla. The nephew, William Kennedy Smith, was charged with raping a young woman at the Kennedy family estate that night.</p> <p>The investigator was told to stand down and passed the information to other Senate offices. Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden led the subsequent public hearings. Kennedy became a target of ridicule after tales of how he had wandered the grounds of his seaside home that night, without pants, reached the writers at Saturday Night Live and the Tonight show.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4f/d5/36830e7140dba4a1f80bb59f047a/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>The Bork-slayer had been silenced. “Viscerally and visually he was getting smaller and smaller … just sinking into his chair … becoming a little shriveled man,” said Judith Lichtman, the longtime women’s advocate. If Kennedy had not been cowed by the Palm Beach scandal, author and journalist Timothy Phelps, who broke the Hill story, told me, Thomas would never have served on the Supreme Court.</p> <p>Kennedy’s hometown newspaper, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, questioned his continued usefulness in office.</p> <p>“Those who have generally supported Kennedy over the years — and we include ourselves in that number — have maintained that his private behavior, however reprehensible one judges it to be, has not adversely affected his performance as a public official,” the <i>Globe </i>editorialized. “Sadly, that contention can no longer be made.”</p> <p>Chappaquiddick, Palm Beach, “and other, periodic results of reckless behavior by Kennedy have diminished his moral authority. … Neither he nor his supporters can again assert that his private life has no impact on the discharge of his public duties.”</p> <p>There are other instances where Kennedy was muzzled by his private misbehavior. In the months after Chappaquiddick, he had sat on the sidelines as Sen. Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, and other liberals led the successful opposition to two of Richard Nixon’s Supreme Court nominees — federal judges Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, two Southerners whose speeches and rulings showed them as defenders of the South’s white supremacist order.</p> <p>Kennedy’s “moral armor was in bad repair,” wrote newsman William Eaton, who would win a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the nomination. “This was right after Chappaquiddick,” Jason Berman, an aide to Bayh, said when I spoke to him. “You can understand, if you were going to make the fight on grounds of ethics and morality, why Teddy would not have been the best candidate.”</p> <p>A few months later, his colleagues in the Democratic caucus dumped Kennedy, whom they had elevated to lead them in battle against the wily and formidable Nixon, from his job as Senate whip.</p> <p>“He took us with him over that bridge,” said Sen. Walter Mondale, the liberal Democrat from Minnesota, “because he was sort of our star.” The Senate Democrats replaced Kennedy with the more conservative Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. “It was a huge humiliation within the Senate — a very personal thing that happened to him that senators rarely do to each other,” Mondale said. “Chappaquiddick got him.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/70/1d/4b7fd6574015a3d465cab5c7e2d6/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>But it is not until now, with the quiet return of a Senate Judiciary Committee’s file on Watergate to its rightful place in the National Archives, that this new story can be told.</p> <p>The Watergate file had been wrongly withheld from historians and biographers with Kennedy’s papers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, instead of at the Archives, where Senate committee records are supposed to be kept. It reappeared in the Judiciary committee files after Kennedy’s death. I came upon it in my research for a new biography, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Ted Kennedy: A Life</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89040001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>Ted Kennedy: A Life</i></a>, from which this article is adapted.</p> <p>The documents tell of 1972, a time when Nixon was riding high, having made his world-jolting trip to China — and following it up by joining Soviet leaders at a momentous summit, for the signing of arms control treaties, in Moscow.</p> <p>But the president — who gnawed on the belief that the Kennedy clan had stolen the 1960 election from him — was possessed with the fear that they would do it again, with Ted Kennedy as a candidate, in 1972.</p> <p>“Nixon was mesmerized by Ted Kennedy. Even after Chappaquiddick,” Tom Korologos, who lobbied for the administration on Capitol Hill, told me. “The Kennedys had screwed him in 1960. He had a syndrome. He didn’t want it to happen again. He was paranoid. Really. Paranoid.”</p> <p>Nixon pressed his staff for dirt on Kennedy and other Democrats. In May of 1971, he had ordered them to proceed with a campaign of bugging and surveillance. “I want, Bob, more use of wiretapping,” he told his chief of staff, H.R. “Bob” Haldeman. “Kennedy… Maybe we can get a real scandal on any one of the leading Democrats.”</p> <p>The president’s men picked up the pace, with schemes to wreak havoc at the Democratic national convention in Miami, to break into McGovern’s headquarters and to bug Democratic headquarters at the Watergate office building. On June 17, at the Watergate, a team of Nixon’s burglars got caught.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/17/ed/27a8aa794c38b0dabe283df1006e/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>Watergate was a self-inflicted wound by Nixon. The Democratic convention was a catastrophe that summer — with scuffling between the New Left and vanquished party moderates, sophomoric liberal antics (there were votes to give Mao Zedong, Archie Bunker and Benjamin Spock the vice-presidential nomination) and a general lack of discipline that delayed McGovern’s acceptance speech until almost 3 a.m. “Only in Guam,” noted the campaign chronicler Theodore H. White, “was George McGovern speaking in prime time under the American flag.”</p> <p>And then bad turned to worse, as the vice-presidential candidate — Senator Joseph Eagleton of Missouri — was compelled to resign from the ticket for not disclosing hospitalizations, electric shock sessions and other mental health treatments he had undergone.</p> <p>Nixon’s own convention was superbly choreographed. He had browbeat the Federal Reserve into stoking the roaring economy. He was cutting a deal with the North Vietnamese that would doom the American ally, South Vietnam, in the long term but give Nixon something to boast about that fall. “Peace is at hand,” said his adviser, Henry Kissinger, in October.</p> <p>Through all this, the Watergate coverup continued. With perjury and payoffs, Nixon and his aides cloaked the president’s involvement. At the <i>Washington Post</i>, two young reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helped keep the story alive. Out of the public eye, the <i>Post</i>’s efforts were matched by one of Kennedy’s aides, the inestimable James Flug, that summer and fall.</p> <p>Kennedy had found how his family’s mystique lured the best and brightest to Washington and to his staff, and Flug was a premier example. Brooklyn-born and tough, he graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from Harvard and then from Harvard Law School. Kennedy kept a loose rein on his staff, Flug told me before his death in 2020, and he was given freedom to roam. He excelled, said a fellow aide, in taking Ted Kennedy into political thickets, from which the senator had to hack his way out.</p> <p>Watergate was the ultimate thicket. The vehicle was Kennedy’s little Judiciary subcommittee. In addition to a panel on refugees, and a Senate Labor subcommittee on health, he chaired an all-purpose toolbox with jurisdiction over the federal government’s administrative procedures and practices. Known as Ad Prac, its charter was basically anything that Ted Kennedy could convince the Judiciary chairman, James Eastland of Mississippi, to OK. “It was bottom-up work,” former staffer Thomas Susman said. Kennedy’s aides brought their groundwork to the boss. He then made the choice to join, or to skip, a scrap.</p> <p>Flug was the Ad Prac counsel. By mid-August, he was well-versed in the Watergate scandal and plugged into the network of lawyers, government accountants and investigators who were building a case against the president’s men. “Flug was finding connections and weaving patterns that were just sort of mind-boggling,” Kennedy would recall, in an oral history for the University of Virginia.</p> <p>Flug was one of the first congressional investigators to interview Alfred Baldwin, the Nixon hireling who monitored the Watergate wiretaps from a hotel across the street — and famously served as the lookout for the burglars on the night of the break-in. It is Baldwin who is immortalized in the opening scenes of the motion picture <i>All the President’s Men, </i>alerting his cohorts (“Base One to Unit One — we have some activity here…”) to the arrival of the police<i>.</i></p> <p>Flug warned Kennedy, in a long August memo, that Nixon’s men were succeeding, via perjury and other means, at covering up the ties between the burglars, who were about to be indicted and brought to trial, and the White House.</p> <p>“The information in the indictments will probably not provide much real detail on the who, what or how of the plot,” Flug wrote. “The indictments will be better than nothing, (but) they will be of very limited utility in bringing out the whole story.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democrats had chosen McGovern. Kennedy gave a rousing speech at the convention but turned McGovern down when asked to be his running mate. Kennedy’s family was worried about his safety, and he instinctively recoiled from the inconsequential duties of the office. “I am not cut out that way,” he told the <i>Boston Globe</i>. “The vice presidency is good for some people. However, I don’t need that kind of exposure.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/38/18/4e8ae8304b60b3bbd30934fb32af/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary4.jpg\"> <br> <p>Performing a mitzvah for the party might have been a smart move. By declining to serve, Kennedy squandered an opportunity to be vetted and immunized, on a national stage, for his behavior at Chappaquiddick. “You do the penance, as they say, as a vice presidential candidate,” <i>Boston Globe</i> editor Robert Healy told White House aide Charles Colson, in a transcribed phone call. “You do the bit for the party and then in ’76 you have done it and because you’ve done it Chappaquiddick fades away. … I think that really makes some sense.”</p> <p>“That’s the one rationale,” Colson agreed.</p> <p>McGovern understood Kennedy’s reticence but bristled at the selfishness Kennedy displayed <i>after</i> declining the candidate’s offer. Like a wolf marking his territory, Kennedy blackballed McGovern’s second choice, Mayor Kevin White of Boston. If Kennedy wished to run for president himself someday, he did not see the sense in raising another Irish-Catholic from Massachusetts to national prominence. With cursory vetting, and the clock running, McGovern picked Eagleton instead.</p> <p>It was a disastrous start for McGovern’s fall campaign. Nixon had the economy on fire and a string of foreign policy successes to tout. Despite the Democratic nominee’s military record — as a bomber pilot, he flew 35 missions against the Nazis — Nixon portrayed him as an irresolute radical.<br></p> <br> <p><b>McGovern’s opportunity to </b>regain ground, it seemed, rested with the Watergate scandal. It “has become one of the major issues of the 1972 Presidential campaign,” an eight-page, single-spaced McGovern campaign memo to the nation’s editors and television producers declared rather hopefully on September 22. “Repeated Republican denials of complicity in the break-in have been met with repeated discoveries of evidence to the contrary.”</p> <p>In his own memo, Flug told Kennedy that the office was getting heat from the McGovern campaign. “They, of course, think this is the best thing they have going.”</p> <p>Kennedy faced a decision, similar to those he confronted in the Haynsworth and Carswell battles. Did he have the credibility, after Chappaquiddick, to launch a highly public investigation of corrupt acts by others? Would his presence distort the public’s perception of the crimes committed in Nixon’s name?</p> <p>“My natural inclination, like yours, is to go — it’s too meaty a thing to stay away from,” Flug urged his boss. “But for the same reason, it could backfire big and leave you looking like McGovern’s political hatchet man.”</p> <p>Kennedy’s choice was a topic of debate for years. Nixon and his aides would ultimately credit “the fine hand of the Kennedys” with the creation of the Senate Watergate Committee, the appointment of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, and the president’s slow and steady downfall. McGovern’s advisers, however, were just as agitated — filling the air with “unprintable expletives,” according to columnist Stewart Alsop — by what they perceived as Kennedy’s failure to act. Upon examination, McGovern may have had the better cause to complain.</p> <p>There were, to be sure, complications. To start, there was Kennedy’s proposed use of Ad Prac. Some in the Senate objected to his view of the panel as an unfettered hunting license and argued that a Watergate investigation would be better launched from a committee with clear jurisdiction like Government Operations. On the other hand, Kennedy had held hearings on the threat posed to civil liberties by wiretapping long before Watergate, and so had precedent on his side. Nor did other senators show an appetite in taking on Nixon.

Nixon had stoked the economy and forecast “peace with honor” in Vietnam. Only the trifling cloud called Watergate shadowed the president’s expected victory.\n All of which placed Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts under intense pressure. His Judiciary Committee investigators had corralled a witness who, given the drama of a public hearing, an eager media and the dazzle of the Kennedy name, could shatter the Watergate cover up and breathe new life into McGovern’s campaign.\n \n “A giant fraud is being perpetrated upon the American people, and anyone who has it within his power to help expose that fraud has a responsibility to the public and to himself to do so as soon and as dramatically as possible,” one of Kennedy’s advisers contended in a memo to the senator.\n But a man-to-man showdown with Nixon would raise the issue of Kennedy’s own scandalous behavior. Only three years had passed since the night on Chappaquiddick, when he drove his car off an unmarked bridge and cost Mary Jo Kopechne her life. And it could be seen as partisan hatchetry.\n “I think the public should get as many facts as possible before the election, but I see no reason why we have to be the ones who do it … if our doing it is going to raise a serious collateral issue,” another aide responded.\n In the end, not for the first or last time in a storied career, Ted Kennedy’s private failings afflicted his public performance. He held no hearings in that election season. Nixon carried 49 states.\n In the hyper-partisan era of Donald Trump, the notion of a politician’s personal shortcomings hurting their political chances seems quaint. Far from disqualifying him, the 45th president’s litany of controversies — from shady business practices to the Billy Bush tape — seemed to boost his image and excite his base. Even now, following the events of January 6, Trump remains the de facto leader (and presumptive 2024 nominee) of the GOP.\n But as Ted Kennedy’s career shows, politics did not always operate this way. At key junctions in American history, his vulnerability on issues of personal character kept him from acting on public policy. His silence during the hearings over Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a classic example.\n Now, thanks to the unheralded release of a Senate Judiciary Committee file on Watergate that was improperly withheld from the public for decades, we have another case in point. This is the untold story of why Kennedy declined to stage what one aide described as “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions” and, to the dismay of fellow Democrats, dawdled as Nixon coasted to a landslide reelection.\n \n Kennedy’s career has many might-have-beens. The most widely known occurred in 1991, when one of his investigators, Ricki Seidman, was the first Senate aide to speak to Anita Hill and hear her allegation that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the years before his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n Kennedy had played a leading role in defeating another conservative nominee to the high court — Judge Robert Bork — in 1987, but now was in no shape to question Thomas’ behavior. The senator was ensnared by scandal that spring and summer after he woke his son and nephew for some late-night carousing in Palm Beach, Fla. The nephew, William Kennedy Smith, was charged with raping a young woman at the Kennedy family estate that night.\n The investigator was told to stand down and passed the information to other Senate offices. Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden led the subsequent public hearings. Kennedy became a target of ridicule after tales of how he had wandered the grounds of his seaside home that night, without pants, reached the writers at Saturday Night Live and the Tonight show.\n \n  \n The Bork-slayer had been silenced. “Viscerally and visually he was getting smaller and smaller … just sinking into his chair … becoming a little shriveled man,” said Judith Lichtman, the longtime women’s advocate. If Kennedy had not been cowed by the Palm Beach scandal, author and journalist Timothy Phelps, who broke the Hill story, told me, Thomas would never have served on the Supreme Court.\n Kennedy’s hometown newspaper, the Boston Globe, questioned his continued usefulness in office.\n “Those who have generally supported Kennedy over the years — and we include ourselves in that number — have maintained that his private behavior, however reprehensible one judges it to be, has not adversely affected his performance as a public official,” the Globe editorialized. “Sadly, that contention can no longer be made.”\n Chappaquiddick, Palm Beach, “and other, periodic results of reckless behavior by Kennedy have diminished his moral authority. … Neither he nor his supporters can again assert that his private life has no impact on the discharge of his public duties.”\n There are other instances where Kennedy was muzzled by his private misbehavior. In the months after Chappaquiddick, he had sat on the sidelines as Sen. Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, and other liberals led the successful opposition to two of Richard Nixon’s Supreme Court nominees — federal judges Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, two Southerners whose speeches and rulings showed them as defenders of the South’s white supremacist order.\n Kennedy’s “moral armor was in bad repair,” wrote newsman William Eaton, who would win a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the nomination. “This was right after Chappaquiddick,” Jason Berman, an aide to Bayh, said when I spoke to him. “You can understand, if you were going to make the fight on grounds of ethics and morality, why Teddy would not have been the best candidate.”\n A few months later, his colleagues in the Democratic caucus dumped Kennedy, whom they had elevated to lead them in battle against the wily and formidable Nixon, from his job as Senate whip.\n “He took us with him over that bridge,” said Sen. Walter Mondale, the liberal Democrat from Minnesota, “because he was sort of our star.” The Senate Democrats replaced Kennedy with the more conservative Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. “It was a huge humiliation within the Senate — a very personal thing that happened to him that senators rarely do to each other,” Mondale said. “Chappaquiddick got him.”\n \n  \n But it is not until now, with the quiet return of a Senate Judiciary Committee’s file on Watergate to its rightful place in the National Archives, that this new story can be told.\n The Watergate file had been wrongly withheld from historians and biographers with Kennedy’s papers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, instead of at the Archives, where Senate committee records are supposed to be kept. It reappeared in the Judiciary committee files after Kennedy’s death. I came upon it in my research for a new biography, Ted Kennedy: A Life\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89040000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89040001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Ted Kennedy: A Life, from which this article is adapted.\n The documents tell of 1972, a time when Nixon was riding high, having made his world-jolting trip to China — and following it up by joining Soviet leaders at a momentous summit, for the signing of arms control treaties, in Moscow.\n But the president — who gnawed on the belief that the Kennedy clan had stolen the 1960 election from him — was possessed with the fear that they would do it again, with Ted Kennedy as a candidate, in 1972.\n “Nixon was mesmerized by Ted Kennedy. Even after Chappaquiddick,” Tom Korologos, who lobbied for the administration on Capitol Hill, told me. “The Kennedys had screwed him in 1960. He had a syndrome. He didn’t want it to happen again. He was paranoid. Really. Paranoid.”\n Nixon pressed his staff for dirt on Kennedy and other Democrats. In May of 1971, he had ordered them to proceed with a campaign of bugging and surveillance. “I want, Bob, more use of wiretapping,” he told his chief of staff, H.R. “Bob” Haldeman. “Kennedy… Maybe we can get a real scandal on any one of the leading Democrats.”\n The president’s men picked up the pace, with schemes to wreak havoc at the Democratic national convention in Miami, to break into McGovern’s headquarters and to bug Democratic headquarters at the Watergate office building. On June 17, at the Watergate, a team of Nixon’s burglars got caught.\n \n  \n Watergate was a self-inflicted wound by Nixon. The Democratic convention was a catastrophe that summer — with scuffling between the New Left and vanquished party moderates, sophomoric liberal antics (there were votes to give Mao Zedong, Archie Bunker and Benjamin Spock the vice-presidential nomination) and a general lack of discipline that delayed McGovern’s acceptance speech until almost 3 a.m. “Only in Guam,” noted the campaign chronicler Theodore H. White, “was George McGovern speaking in prime time under the American flag.”\n And then bad turned to worse, as the vice-presidential candidate — Senator Joseph Eagleton of Missouri — was compelled to resign from the ticket for not disclosing hospitalizations, electric shock sessions and other mental health treatments he had undergone.\n Nixon’s own convention was superbly choreographed. He had browbeat the Federal Reserve into stoking the roaring economy. He was cutting a deal with the North Vietnamese that would doom the American ally, South Vietnam, in the long term but give Nixon something to boast about that fall. “Peace is at hand,” said his adviser, Henry Kissinger, in October.\n Through all this, the Watergate coverup continued. With perjury and payoffs, Nixon and his aides cloaked the president’s involvement. At the Washington Post, two young reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helped keep the story alive. Out of the public eye, the Post’s efforts were matched by one of Kennedy’s aides, the inestimable James Flug, that summer and fall.\n Kennedy had found how his family’s mystique lured the best and brightest to Washington and to his staff, and Flug was a premier example. Brooklyn-born and tough, he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and then from Harvard Law School. Kennedy kept a loose rein on his staff, Flug told me before his death in 2020, and he was given freedom to roam. He excelled, said a fellow aide, in taking Ted Kennedy into political thickets, from which the senator had to hack his way out.\n Watergate was the ultimate thicket. The vehicle was Kennedy’s little Judiciary subcommittee. In addition to a panel on refugees, and a Senate Labor subcommittee on health, he chaired an all-purpose toolbox with jurisdiction over the federal government’s administrative procedures and practices. Known as Ad Prac, its charter was basically anything that Ted Kennedy could convince the Judiciary chairman, James Eastland of Mississippi, to OK. “It was bottom-up work,” former staffer Thomas Susman said. Kennedy’s aides brought their groundwork to the boss. He then made the choice to join, or to skip, a scrap.\n Flug was the Ad Prac counsel. By mid-August, he was well-versed in the Watergate scandal and plugged into the network of lawyers, government accountants and investigators who were building a case against the president’s men. “Flug was finding connections and weaving patterns that were just sort of mind-boggling,” Kennedy would recall, in an oral history for the University of Virginia.\n Flug was one of the first congressional investigators to interview Alfred Baldwin, the Nixon hireling who monitored the Watergate wiretaps from a hotel across the street — and famously served as the lookout for the burglars on the night of the break-in. It is Baldwin who is immortalized in the opening scenes of the motion picture All the President’s Men, alerting his cohorts (“Base One to Unit One — we have some activity here…”) to the arrival of the police.\n Flug warned Kennedy, in a long August memo, that Nixon’s men were succeeding, via perjury and other means, at covering up the ties between the burglars, who were about to be indicted and brought to trial, and the White House.\n “The information in the indictments will probably not provide much real detail on the who, what or how of the plot,” Flug wrote. “The indictments will be better than nothing, (but) they will be of very limited utility in bringing out the whole story.”\n Meanwhile, the Democrats had chosen McGovern. Kennedy gave a rousing speech at the convention but turned McGovern down when asked to be his running mate. Kennedy’s family was worried about his safety, and he instinctively recoiled from the inconsequential duties of the office. “I am not cut out that way,” he told the Boston Globe. “The vice presidency is good for some people. However, I don’t need that kind of exposure.”\n \n  \n Performing a mitzvah for the party might have been a smart move. By declining to serve, Kennedy squandered an opportunity to be vetted and immunized, on a national stage, for his behavior at Chappaquiddick. “You do the penance, as they say, as a vice presidential candidate,” Boston Globe editor Robert Healy told White House aide Charles Colson, in a transcribed phone call. “You do the bit for the party and then in ’76 you have done it and because you’ve done it Chappaquiddick fades away. … I think that really makes some sense.”\n “That’s the one rationale,” Colson agreed.\n McGovern understood Kennedy’s reticence but bristled at the selfishness Kennedy displayed after declining the candidate’s offer. Like a wolf marking his territory, Kennedy blackballed McGovern’s second choice, Mayor Kevin White of Boston. If Kennedy wished to run for president himself someday, he did not see the sense in raising another Irish-Catholic from Massachusetts to national prominence. With cursory vetting, and the clock running, McGovern picked Eagleton instead.\n It was a disastrous start for McGovern’s fall campaign. Nixon had the economy on fire and a string of foreign policy successes to tout. Despite the Democratic nominee’s military record — as a bomber pilot, he flew 35 missions against the Nazis — Nixon portrayed him as an irresolute radical.\n \n McGovern’s opportunity to regain ground, it seemed, rested with the Watergate scandal. It “has become one of the major issues of the 1972 Presidential campaign,” an eight-page, single-spaced McGovern campaign memo to the nation’s editors and television producers declared rather hopefully on September 22. “Repeated Republican denials of complicity in the break-in have been met with repeated discoveries of evidence to the contrary.”\n In his own memo, Flug told Kennedy that the office was getting heat from the McGovern campaign. “They, of course, think this is the best thing they have going.”\n Kennedy faced a decision, similar to those he confronted in the Haynsworth and Carswell battles. Did he have the credibility, after Chappaquiddick, to launch a highly public investigation of corrupt acts by others? Would his presence distort the public’s perception of the crimes committed in Nixon’s name?\n “My natural inclination, like yours, is to go — it’s too meaty a thing to stay away from,” Flug urged his boss. “But for the same reason, it could backfire big and leave you looking like McGovern’s political hatchet man.”\n Kennedy’s choice was a topic of debate for years. Nixon and his aides would ultimately credit “the fine hand of the Kennedys” with the creation of the Senate Watergate Committee, the appointment of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, and the president’s slow and steady downfall. McGovern’s advisers, however, were just as agitated — filling the air with “unprintable expletives,” according to columnist Stewart Alsop — by what they perceived as Kennedy’s failure to act. Upon examination, McGovern may have had the better cause to complain.\n There were, to be sure, complications. To start, there was Kennedy’s proposed use of Ad Prac. Some in the Senate objected to his view of the panel as an unfettered hunting license and argued that a Watergate investigation would be better launched from a committee with clear jurisdiction like Government Operations. On the other hand, Kennedy had held hearings on the threat posed to civil liberties by wiretapping long before Watergate, and so had precedent on his side. Nor did other senators show an appetite in taking on Nixon. The relevant committees were in the hands of Southerners, aghast at McGovern’s liberal views and with no fierce desire to hand him the White House.\n A month before the election, the leading alternative — Senator Sam Ervin, who chaired Government Operations and a Judiciary subcommittee — took himself out of the running. Instead, he encouraged Kennedy to unmask the cover up with a televised public hearing — Kennedy vs. Nixon — that would guarantee blanket coverage and commentary. They had a prize catch in Baldwin, who could spin a gripping blow-by-blow account of the burglary, the bugging and the involvement of Nixon campaign officials. “I want to urge you to consider hearings,” Ervin said. It would be “a perfectly proper congressional inquiry into how the Justice Department is performing its obligation to the American people.”\n \n  \n As a dean of the Senate and a voice from the South, Ervin carried weight. He was “bad on civil rights,” but “incredibly good on civil liberties,” Kennedy would recall. Ervin’s imprimatur would keep peace in the Senate, but it led Kennedy to other questions: Would his investigation be deemed credible by the press and the voters? Could he lose more than he might win?\n Kennedy had Flug poll the clan. Calls went out to Burke Marshall and others from the late Robert Kennedy’s staff, to McGovern, and to Kennedy advisers David Burke, Richard Goodwin and Lawrence O’Brien. Attorney Edward Bennett Williams and his partner Joseph Califano, whose firm represented the Washington Post and the Democratic Party, were consulted. Kennedy’s allies on the subcommittee — Senators Phil Hart of Michigan, John Tunney of California, Bayh and North Dakota Sen. Quentin Burdick — were canvassed as well.\n On September 28, Flug sent Kennedy three memos. Written by different advisers — and signed only “X” and “Y” and “Z” to encourage candor — each outlined a course of action.\n The first memo, by “X,” gave the case for restraint. Putting Baldwin on the stand would be “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions,” X acknowledged. But it could make it impossible for the other Watergate burglars to get a fair trial. “Especially in the fields of justice and liberty, the most outrageous dimension of the Nixon Administration has been its constant readiness to sacrifice principles … (in favor of) short-run pragmatic expediency,” X wrote. “To fight such cynicism and opportunism by partaking of it ourselves would be hypocrisy of the first order.”\n Principle aside, there was politics to consider. Nixon would lash back — accusing Kennedy of trashing the defendants’ rights.\n “We would be playing in a rough league, and we would have to be prepared to play rough,” X wrote. Baldwin’s testimony would be one man’s story, and relied in part on hearsay. They needed more proof that the White House was involved or that “the fix is in” at the Justice Department. “Right now we don’t have it.”\n The second memo, from “Y,” gave the aggressive point of view, and was titled, “Why Ad Prac should announce Watergate Hearings Now.” Here was the case for a full-fledged assault before the election. “Even if Baldwin is our only witness, his story is one of ruthless lawlessness by employees of the (Nixon) Re-Election Committee,” Y wrote. They had a moral obligation to expose Nixon’s transgressions. “If we are going to stand quietly in the face of both a scandal of historic proportions and a politically motivated effort to … cover up that scandal until after Election Day, then we deserve the kind of government we are getting.”\n “It would be wise to be polite and say that the facts will come out in the course of the criminal trial,” wrote Y. “But the cruel truth is that the investigation has been in the hands of (Nixon administration) officials with the grossest kind of conflict of interest who delayed the indictment so that a pre-election trial would be impossible.”\n “This is a hearing that would be the biggest thing … and would get across to the public, in a way that even the trial itself won’t do, the enormity of the violations of laws and rights,” Y argued. “When a gross impropriety like the Watergate plot occurs, it is much more important to get to the heart of the matter, fix ultimate responsibility … and to assure that the whole process is cleansed.”\n The third memo, by “Z,” contained a cautionary, middle approach, outlining the path that Kennedy ultimately chose: to keep investigating, but to forego hearings. It was temperate, responsible — and timorous. To the considerable exasperation of McGovern’s presidential campaign, and some on his own staff, Kennedy chose not to give the voters a full account before the November election. “I don’t want a circus or to look like a headline hunter,” Kennedy told a reporter from National Journal.\n And so the moment passed. Americans would not hear before the election what Baldwin had to say: that Attorney General John Mitchell and other high-ranking Nixon administration officials were involved in the break-in, that McGovern headquarters had also been targeted for bugging, or how the cover-up began.\n \n  \n  \nBaldwin ultimately gave an interview to the Los Angeles Times, but it lacked the punch of a televised congressional hearing and faded from the public debate. Things seemed settled until, on October 10, Woodward and Bernstein disclosed that the Watergate break-in was but part of a widespread, well-funded campaign of political sabotage and espionage coordinated by White House officials.\n This gave Kennedy a second opportunity — a field of inquiry that would not threaten the defendants’ rights in the upcoming Watergate trial. His staff would launch a “preliminary inquiry,” Kennedy announced. Flug went back to work.\n Bernstein was invited to interview the senator. He found him guarded, cagey. “I know the people around Nixon,” Kennedy told him. “They are thugs.” But he had no illusions about what he could accomplish this late in the election. At best, his investigation would be a “holding action,” he said, to keep Nixon’s crew from destroying the evidence, and to keep some heat on those running the cover-up.\n Politically, there was “no percentage” in it, Kennedy confided to the reporter. The White House would go “with everything it had to smear him,” he said. He was vulnerable on Mary Jo Kopechne’s death and other “nickel-and-dime stuff.”\n Indeed, Nixon’s allies — Strom Thurmond, Barry Goldwater and Clare Boothe Luce — would soon raise Chappaquiddick anyway.\n “There is still that little truism which says people who live in glass houses should not throw stones,” Goldwater said. In an op-ed in the New York Times, Luce quoted the bumper sticker slogan: “Nobody was drowned at Watergate.”\n Flug was permitted to proceed. Subpoenas were issued. Bank records were collected. Kennedy’s staff ran down the head trickster, Donald Segretti, and the paymaster — Nixon’s personal lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach. But, once again, no hearings were held. At a climactic meeting with his staff in December, Kennedy decided to put off the confrontation.\n “Since the expected outcome was so uncertain, and the prospect of EMK falling on his face was so possible, no decision was made,” an internal office memo noted.\n At the White House, as Nixon’s secret taping system captured their remarks, the president and his men chortled. Kennedy was backing off, Haldeman told the pleased Nixon, because he had been compromised at Chappaquiddick.\n On Nixon’s birthday, in early January, his staff sent him a telegram. Allegedly from Kennedy, the “Director of Water Safety,” it invited Nixon to “a quiet weekend at Chappaquiddick” for a “homey family barbeque” and added, “P.S. Bring your bathing suit.”\n From the book TED KENNEDY: A Life, by John A. Farrell, published by Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

Johnson.</p> <p>Ossoff’s efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/84/c5/137af67e44869857ce74b4acae51/election-2022-georgia-senate-10388.jpg\"> <br> <p>The network of field organizers is racing to turn out every possible voter for Nov. 8 — and then may have to turn around and do it again four weeks later, if the Warnock-Walker race goes to a runoff because no one got a majority of the vote.</p> <p>But notably, some of the outside groups knocking on doors ahead of the midterms have raised serious concerns that they’re not as well-funded as they have been in the past, severely limiting the scope of their turnout efforts in 2022.</p> <p>“I expected [the funding] to be different because it was not a presidential year,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. “But it’s not even on par, in terms of resources, compared to 2018.”</p> <p>Brown noted Georgia’s new voting law implemented in 2021 by the Republican-controlled state legislature, which made significant changes to the runoff rules. The biggest one was shortening the runoff period from nine weeks to four weeks, but the new law also restricted early voting during a runoff and essentially eliminated the ability to register new voters during a runoff period, as the registration deadline is 29 days before an election.</p> <p>That makes organizing ahead of a possible Dec. 6 runoff especially important.</p> <p>“I think that the state GOP made changes to the runoff process that they believe benefited them electorally,” Ossoff said. “But this is the most battle-tested political organization in the country because all of our volunteers have been through the two biggest races in recent history.”</p> <p>Ossoff has had a unique vantage point on Georgia’s recent evolution into a battleground state — and the organizing that went into it. His narrow loss in a 2017 House special election heralded the suburban revolt against then-President Donald Trump that flipped the House to Democrats a year later.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6312647050112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>Before Ossoff’s special election, former state Sen. Jason Carter acknowledged that the Democratic infrastructure in Georgia was suffering from “extreme atrophy.” But Carter, the Democratic nominee for governor in 2014, said that Trump’s election as president and the subsequent special election “super-charged the energy surrounding those organizational efforts.”</p> <p>“Then, Abrams in 2018 continued to use that energy to build more of an organization on the ground and across the state, which came to fruition with Trump on the ballot in 2020,” Carter said. He added: “Now, what we’re looking at for this election is, how far does that organization take us when the super-charged Trump energy is lessened?”</p> <p>Ossoff himself described his electoral history as “unusual,” noting that “having run in the biggest U.S. House race of all time, and then running in this, well, the biggest Senate race of all time, afforded [the campaign] an opportunity to innovate.”</p> <p>A post-election analysis of Ossoff’s field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoff’s “paid relational” organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.</p> <p>The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become “community mobilizers” — a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.</p> <p>They could spend millions of dollars to pilot this program because “the circumstances were so extraordinary [and] the resources were vast,” Ossoff said, so the campaign could try “these innovative organizing techniques, at a statewide scale.”</p> <p>“We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off,” Ossoff continued.</p> <p>This time, though, Democrats' organizing machine is going up against a Republican base fired up to remove them from power, instead of drafting off anti-Trump energy when he was in the White House.<br></p> <br> <p>Meanwhile, even the most dedicated Georgia Democrats are showing some wear and tear after a nonstop succession of must-win races in their state.</p> <p>Michelle DeHaven, a 63-year-old semi-retired veterinarian who attended Warnock’s campaign rally in Brunswick, Ga., last week, said that in 2020 and 2021, she was “volunteering five days a week, canvassing every spare minute” she had. “I have not pulled my share this time,” she added.</p> <p>“It just seems like, getting back out there, knocking on the same doors again,” DeHaven said with a big sigh. “Yeah, I’m tired, but I’m also scared.”</p> <p>Bob Byrd, a 63-year-old former communications executive who also volunteers with the Glynn County Democratic Party, said he's worried that voters don’t know there’s yet another election to vote in.</p> <p>“I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, ‘No, I already voted for these people,’” he said. “Then, we have to explain to people, ‘Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now you’ve got to go again.’”</p> <p>“And you’ll probably have to go in December and do it one more time,” he added.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"SAVANNAH, Ga. — Sen.

Raphael Warnock in Jan. 2021 runoffs, is revving up a field organization that tested innovative ways to get unlikely-to-vote citizens to turn out two years ago. The methods helped mobilize Democratic voters in enough numbers to flip the Senate.\n The stakes are just as high now. Recent public polling shows this year’s race between Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker remains a dead heat, even amid revelations of numerous scandals around Walker. The state could once again determine the balance of power in the 50-50 Senate. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was caught on a hot mic Thursday telling President Joe Biden that the race was “going downhill.”\n But Ossoff believes that a strong field operation can change the electorate, and he’s spending six-figures from his own leadership PAC account to try, according to his campaign aides.\n “We've demonstrated since 2017 that continually investing in organizing, especially young voters, is so important, and so I'm using the organization that I've built and putting it back to work,” Ossoff said in an interview with POLITICO, after launching a canvass effort in a strip mall parking lot alongside Warnock, Democratic House candidate Wade Herring and Savannah Mayor Van R. Johnson.\n Ossoff’s efforts join a sprawling network of field operations in the state, spearheaded by Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor. A number of get-out-the-vote nonprofits are also involved, as Democrats look for a way to close strong after several weeks of public polling gains by GOP Senate candidates, including Walker.\n \n  \n The network of field organizers is racing to turn out every possible voter for Nov. 8 — and then may have to turn around and do it again four weeks later, if the Warnock-Walker race goes to a runoff because no one got a majority of the vote.\n But notably, some of the outside groups knocking on doors ahead of the midterms have raised serious concerns that they’re not as well-funded as they have been in the past, severely limiting the scope of their turnout efforts in 2022.\n “I expected [the funding] to be different because it was not a presidential year,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. “But it’s not even on par, in terms of resources, compared to 2018.”\n Brown noted Georgia’s new voting law implemented in 2021 by the Republican-controlled state legislature, which made significant changes to the runoff rules. The biggest one was shortening the runoff period from nine weeks to four weeks, but the new law also restricted early voting during a runoff and essentially eliminated the ability to register new voters during a runoff period, as the registration deadline is 29 days before an election.\n That makes organizing ahead of a possible Dec. 6 runoff especially important.\n “I think that the state GOP made changes to the runoff process that they believe benefited them electorally,” Ossoff said. “But this is the most battle-tested political organization in the country because all of our volunteers have been through the two biggest races in recent history.”\n Ossoff has had a unique vantage point on Georgia’s recent evolution into a battleground state — and the organizing that went into it. His narrow loss in a 2017 House special election heralded the suburban revolt against then-President Donald Trump that flipped the House to Democrats a year later.\n \n \n Before Ossoff’s special election, former state Sen. Jason Carter acknowledged that the Democratic infrastructure in Georgia was suffering from “extreme atrophy.” But Carter, the Democratic nominee for governor in 2014, said that Trump’s election as president and the subsequent special election “super-charged the energy surrounding those organizational efforts.”\n “Then, Abrams in 2018 continued to use that energy to build more of an organization on the ground and across the state, which came to fruition with Trump on the ballot in 2020,” Carter said. He added: “Now, what we’re looking at for this election is, how far does that organization take us when the super-charged Trump energy is lessened?”\n Ossoff himself described his electoral history as “unusual,” noting that “having run in the biggest U.S. House race of all time, and then running in this, well, the biggest Senate race of all time, afforded [the campaign] an opportunity to innovate.”\n A post-election analysis of Ossoff’s field program, conducted by former campaign aides in the spring of 2021, estimated that Ossoff’s “paid relational” organizing program, paired with a traditional volunteer field organization, boosted turnout by 3.8 percent among 160,000 voters targeted. Ossoff and Warnock won their 2021 runoffs by 55,232 votes and 93,550 votes respectively.\n The idea behind paid relational organizing is this: Ossoff campaign hired 2,800 Georgians, particularly those with little or no voting history themselves, to become “community mobilizers” — a term Ossoff coined for their role. The campaign suspected that those organizers would be well-positioned to influence irregular voters or nonvoters in their own personal networks to get involved.\n They could spend millions of dollars to pilot this program because “the circumstances were so extraordinary [and] the resources were vast,” Ossoff said, so the campaign could try “these innovative organizing techniques, at a statewide scale.”\n “We have been able to significantly increase turnout and participation by young voters and voters who are typically ignored and written off,” Ossoff continued.\n This time, though, Democrats' organizing machine is going up against a Republican base fired up to remove them from power, instead of drafting off anti-Trump energy when he was in the White House.\n \n Meanwhile, even the most dedicated Georgia Democrats are showing some wear and tear after a nonstop succession of must-win races in their state.\n Michelle DeHaven, a 63-year-old semi-retired veterinarian who attended Warnock’s campaign rally in Brunswick, Ga., last week, said that in 2020 and 2021, she was “volunteering five days a week, canvassing every spare minute” she had. “I have not pulled my share this time,” she added.\n “It just seems like, getting back out there, knocking on the same doors again,” DeHaven said with a big sigh. “Yeah, I’m tired, but I’m also scared.”\n Bob Byrd, a 63-year-old former communications executive who also volunteers with the Glynn County Democratic Party, said he's worried that voters don’t know there’s yet another election to vote in.\n “I have gone up to people to talk about the election and had them look me in the eye and say, ‘No, I already voted for these people,’” he said. “Then, we have to explain to people, ‘Yeah, we had a primary, then we had a primary runoff and now you’ve got to go again.’”\n “And you’ll probably have to go in December and do it one more time,” he added.","dc:creator":"Elena Schneider","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/7a/d1/06b6e31c439abf528ee4ce9e6bfe/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1343563416"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Sens.

He doesn’t need it.\n The first-term governor is up 20 points in the polls after defeating a recall attempt around this time last year. He has famously spent campaign cash on billboards in Texas and TV ads in Florida, but has spent little time or money directly boosting his California reelection bid.\n His campaign website doesn’t include a platform. He’s not airing reelection ads.

Kamala Harris said disaster aid should go to non-white citizens first. Liberal politicians block access to medicine based on skin color. Progressive corporations, airlines, universities all openly discriminate against white Americans. Racism is always wrong. The left's anti-white bigotry must stop. We are all entitled to equal treatment under the law.”\n The spot ends with the disclosure that it is paid for by America First Legal, the organization that was founded by Miller after the Trump administration ended, along with former Trump administration officials like Mark Meadows, Matt Whitaker, and Russ Vought.\n \n A media contact for America First Legal did not immediately respond to questions about the scope of the ad buy or the content of the ad. The person who shared the ad with POLITICO said it was airing as part of a buy in Georgia, where a high-profile Senate and gubernatorial campaign is being waged. The spot, the person said, was running in the Augusta, Savannah, Albany, Columbus and Macon markets, as well as in Tallahassee, Fla., just south of the Georgia border.\n The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n The claim that Harris said non-white citizens should be prioritized for disaster relief has been mischaracterized, according to fact checks. Another fact check found the comment from Biden about Covid relief ignored the entirety of his statement, as he was referring to how minority-owned businesses have been disproportionately impacted by the economic crisis. \n Earlier this year, America First Legal filed a lawsuit in the state of New York against a Department of Health guideline for Covid-19 treatment that stated “Non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity should be considered a risk factor, as longstanding systemic health and social inequities have contributed to an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.” They also filed FOIA lawsuits requesting federal agency plans to comply with a Biden order to advance racial justice.\n Citing the same Biden administration order, the group also has sent political mailers that state: “Joe Biden and left-wing officials are engaged in widespread racial discrimination against white and Asian Americans … even though it’s against the law.”\n Miller has a long history of advocating for hard-line immigration and social-conservative policies.

I’d picked up a Culver’s coffee for her on my way because I felt sheepish: Kari Walker deals with reporters every time an election rolls around, because she happens to own a bar and restaurant in the politically swingiest county in one of the politically swingiest states in the country, and it’s one that tends to pick winners.</p> <p>Everybody, she says, wants to know what “secret sauce” accounts for Sauk County’s uncanny record, including voting for the victor in 10 of the last 11 presidential elections; it’s one of only two counties in the state that swung from Obama to Trump and then back to Biden, and Reedsburg itself had gone with the winning candidates in Wisconsin governors’ and Senate races dating back to 2010. “I’ve been on the TV in France,” she’d told me on the phone the night before.

You know, we’ve got 50,000 people in Sauk County, and in 2016, Trump won by 109 votes.” In 2020, he lost the county by 615. These are not margins that lend themselves to sweeping conclusions. Still, Walker ran through the spiel about life in her purple county, how if there are six people sitting at the bar, three voted for Trump and three for Biden in 2020, and she knows all of them and where they work and what they drink and what they drive.</p> <p>If Wisconsin is one of the nation’s premier political battlegrounds, Sauk County is the battleground within the battleground, where the party lean is unpredictable and elections swing by hair’s-width margins. It contains left-leaning tourist towns in the Wisconsin Dells and liberal spillover from the college-town-cum-capital-city of Madison, as well as conservative rural villages and manufacturing centers. If you spot a parade of signs for Republican candidates sticking out of a lawn or a cornfield, or even the rare “Fuck Biden” flag flapping in the wind, you’re seldom far from a procession of signs for Democrats, or maybe even a “LOCK HIM UP.” (“Him” being Trump.)<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/ce/48423fca4a3aa01cf9dfc12043e0/20221013-wis-voters-16.jpeg\"> <br> <p>In this way Sauk mirrors the electoral closeness of the state as a whole, where four of the past six presidential contests were decided by less than a percentage point. Now, as the state faces high-profile contests for its governorship and a U.S. Senate seat that could determine which party controls the whole chamber — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, hoping to hold onto their jobs — Sauk County is a good place to study just what makes Wisconsin so, for lack of a better word, Wisconsiny.</p> <p>Because Wisconsin, at least judging by its current vicious and expensive campaigns, is not so much purple as polarized; it’s a state where <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01056-0\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“median voter theorem”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01056-0&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89160000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89160001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">“median voter theorem”</a><b> </b>goes to die. You might expect politicians in such a closely divided electorate to tack toward the center, take for granted their bases’ votes and cultivate just enough ideological crossover appeal to get to 51 percent. But another way to deal with such an even split is to prioritize turnout over persuasion, which means activating a party’s core of most likely voters, which means stoking partisanship and elevating extremes.

This well-predated the Trump-related polarization that has since swept much of the rest of the country. “I’m not sure it’s really an honor,” Franklin says, “but we were there first.”</p> <p>The problem for normal Wisconsinites is that most of them aren’t really anybody’s base; many I spoke to in Sauk don’t feel represented by the extremes of either party. Kari Walker (the Reedsburg chef, no relation to Walker, the former governor) herself was a somewhat disengaged Republican until Trump ran, and she used to consider herself pro-life as well. Now she listens to “Pod Save America” or the Jan. 6 hearings while she cooks, and she organizes letter-writing campaigns for Democrats. “Democracy is my top issue,” she said. “And my second issue would be reproductive rights.” (Wisconsin abortion clinics <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/no-wisconsin-clinics-are-providing-abortions-friday-after-scotus-struck-down-roe-v-wade\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;have ceased&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wpr.org/no-wisconsin-clinics-are-providing-abortions-friday-after-scotus-struck-down-roe-v-wade&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89170006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89170007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">have ceased</a> operation since the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v.

The manager, Sean McNevin, took me through the warehouse and explained how helium shortages and various supply-chain issues are affecting the business, which buys metals from mills and cuts them up to sell to manufacturers. Notwithstanding politicians’ vows to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest, McNevin said many of his manufacturing clients can’t find enough workers. “It’s a very strong environment for manufacturing.” His top issue is the economy, which he said was now like a roller coaster for a lot of industries, “and we’re just waiting for that drop.” He was noncommittal when I asked for his own views on the midterms but thinks it’s likely that both the Democratic governor and the Republican senator will win in November, because Wisconsinites won’t want to give either party <i>carte blanche</i>.</p> <p>By Election Day, by <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/adimpact-predicts-344m-will-be-spent-on-ads-in-wisconsin-races\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;one estimate&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/adimpact-predicts-344m-will-be-spent-on-ads-in-wisconsin-races&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89170008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89170009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">one estimate</a>, Wisconsinites will have endured some $344-million worth of political advertising, much of which seeks to paint the top candidates on either side as “too extreme” for the state. Voters are set to determine whether abortion will remain illegal, how voting will work in their state, who gets to certify the results of the 2024 presidential election, and possibly which party controls the U.S. Senate. Sauk County offers a glimpse into the split mind of Wisconsin on all of these issues, in a state where many people seem sick of politics, but the politics only seem to get worse, because tiny margins can have big results, and each party sees the stakes as existential.</p> <p>For swing voters like McNevin, it can all be a bit tiring. “It feels like we’re being punished for something.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6e/79/9852f63c48b381d325294594d5e3/20221014-wis-voters-23.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>On one extreme of</b> Sauk County politics lies Sauk City, birthplace of the iconic midwestern fast food chain Culver’s, which has a population of about 3,500 and which Biden won by 28 points in 2020. On the other, a mere 24 miles to the northwest, is Rock Springs, with less than one-tenth of the population at barely 300 people, where Biden lost by 42 points. “What’s interesting about Sauk County is that the denser the population is even within the county, the bluer it is,” said Franklin. “And when you get into the open countryside, the redder it is.”</p> <p>Sauk City, on the blue end of the color spectrum, is an old farm-town but also a commuter haven for Madison liberals; on its outskirts, the family-owned Dorf Haus supper club is an area favorite for fish fry and German food. (As for what distinguishes a “supper club” from a “restaurant,” family member Mitch Maier isn’t exactly sure but thinks a supper club probably needs a deer head on the wall and a reputation for stiff cocktails to qualify). Friday night patrons feigned reluctance to talk about politics, but it was pretty easy to get them going. Maybe that had something to do with the generous brandy Old Fashioneds Mitch’s brother Monte was serving.</p> <p>“It’s very divided,” said a woman named Peggy who declined to give her last name. She had no interest in further alienating anybody; she said her godchild had already unfriended her on Facebook, and her liberal friends were “very staunch,” to the point that “politics have become: ‘Well, you’re stupid,’” she said. “They elected a guy with Alzheimer’s, so who’s stupid? … I’m not a Trumper, we just can’t keep doing what we’re doing.” Her husband, Jim, is 75, a Vietnam veteran and former Democrat who said he switched parties in 2016 because “there was no way I was gonna vote for Hillary.” Now he feels Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes is too far left for the state and finds Johnson to be the better choice, but he said it’s hard to get good information. “You can’t believe what anybody says anymore,” he said. “That’s just scary.”</p> <p>A young couple, Robert Hanson and Samantha Steur, listened to this analysis and stayed largely quiet, except to agree that politics was too divisive, even in Wisconsin’s supposed bastion of Midwest nice. They opened up later at their table, over the schnitzel and spaetzle, where Steur observed that “the left is too far left and the right is too far right” — including Barnes and Johnson respectively. “We’re middle-of-the-road people,” Hanson put in: Both want politicians to try to bring folks together, and the couple sees little of that in the state’s current crop. Hanson feels alienated by the identity politics of the left, but said his top issue is democracy, and he can’t stomach voting for a Republican.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/00/1c/5d40cc51426395a179a5930f2ffb/20221014-wis-voters-21.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Meanwhile, said Steur, “There are two Wisconsins. There’s the one in downtown Madison, and there’s the one at dive bars in Prairie du Sac,” the town adjacent to where we were sitting. “I love both of them. … I don’t know how to build the bridge — or rebuild it, if there ever was one.”</p> <p>Rock Springs is a chunk of the other, redder Wisconsin, and that’s where Ken Pieper sells popcorn from an old-timey wagon about a block away from a mead distillery. Pieper owns River Creek Popcorn, which used to operate out of a storefront until floods ripped through the small downtown and destroyed it. Now, he’s conveniently situated outside his own house, which sports a sign on the lawn for Tim Michels, the Republican challenger to Evers. “There’s a stupid part of this, too,” Pieper said of working so close to home. His former sunroom is overrun with popcorn paraphernalia.</p> <p>He and his brother Dennis stepped out of the wagon to sit on a bench in the chilly sunshine and talk politics, which they usually try not to do, since they’re on opposite sides. Both grew up in Sauk County, on a farm about a mile outside of town, and Ken has a simple explanation for how his brother’s political path diverged from his own. “Ding-a-ling went to work for the teachers union.”</p> <p>Ken hopes Michels wins the governor’s race because “education in Wisconsin is trashed. … I don’t think it was necessarily [Evers] that trashed it, but he ain’t necessarily helped.” (Dennis interjected: “It was Scott Walker that trashed it. I taught for 35 years, so I know.”) Ken just hopes Michels, a wealthy businessman and political novice in Wisconsin who got Trump’s endorsement and then won the GOP primary, won’t be another Trump. Ken likes some of what Trump did for the country, but “If he’d stayed off Twitter and learned to zip his trap, he would’ve been a whole lot better politician. … That kind of worries me about Michels, I mean, he is kind of a Trump person.”</p> <p>The Ken/Dennis divide encapsulates the right/left divide in the midterms: For Ken, the economy is the top issue, and for Dennis, it’s abortion. “The economy was already starting to go downhill badly already when Covid came in,” Dennis said. “So how can you say it’s a Democratic thing when basically it’s been here for four years already?”</p> <p>There followed a semi-friendly bickering match over whether Mandela Barnes is too far left.</p> <p>Dennis: “And you’re thinking your guy isn’t too far right?”</p> <p>Ken: “You can’t get any farther left than with Mandela Barnes.”</p> <p>Dennis: “In what way?”</p> <p>Ken: “Pro-abortion, large federal government, expansion of the government …”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/19/c7e5c71a458db5b45c1ab3cad2eb/20221013-wis-voters-38.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Dennis: “You don’t think Obamacare was good?”</p> <p>Ken: “Not especially. It still was aimed at getting bigger government. … It’s states’ rights, not federal government, that needs to run this country.”</p> <p>Dennis: “So what’s wrong with abortion right now? They’ve given it to states’ rights and now every state’s against every other state.”</p> <p>Ken: “It always was states’ rights. It’s your nutty Supreme Court people called it something else.”</p> <p>Dennis: “But I think at that time it was still five-four in favor of Republicans. …”</p> <p>Ken: “It was a highly liberal Supreme Court. So don’t give me that nonsense.”</p> <p>And so on, down what was clearly quite familiar, and tiresome, terrain to them both. The political conversation dissipated fairly soon into Midwestern sports teams, about which they’re more in agreement, and a bit later the two got back to selling popcorn, wedged with their incompatible worldviews into the same small wagon.</p> <p>They seem to make it work the way Ken said the rest of the county gets along: “It’s kind of a mutual ignoring of the issues.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/5d/083600604b7ea5183e8fc83588f1/20221014-wis-voters-57.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>Just over the county </b>line on a Saturday morning, Leah Spicer and her sister Moriah pushed a stroller containing Moriah’s baby with a “LEAH SPICER FOR STATE ASSEMBLY” sign sticking out of the top.

Spicer jumped in when she saw no one planned to challenge Novak this year, because she doesn’t feel Republicans are representing the state well. “They have drawn the districts in such a way that they can maintain their political power without listening to their constituents,” she said.</p> <p>The district being what it is, when potential voters answer the door, she doesn’t lead with her affiliation. “I’m a little bit nervous about tying myself to the Democratic Party,” she told me. “There’s a lot of mistrust, I think, in politics in general, just like it’s something that happens far away. Politicians don’t represent us well, understand our communities, and I’m really trying to run as like a rural politician, who lives here, who understands.” She ticked off her own personal concerns: Three kids in rural public schools she says are under-funded; a small business, a restaurant she owns in the (liberal) Sauk County village of Spring Green, struggling with costs; aging parents on Social Security; family farm vulnerable to climate change. “In terms of political polarization, we’ve got to brush all that aside,” she said. “Especially in rural areas” — she gestures at the surrounding village of Lone Rock, which bills itself as “the coldest in the nation with the warmest heart,” where the trees have lately burst into bright reds and oranges — “this is all we have. There’s not a lot of people out here. And so if we’re not working together, it’s not going to work.”</p> <p>So when one older woman answered the door that morning, remarked that her concerns were “a lot of stuff — I think the federal government is ridiculous,” and asked if Spicer was a Republican, Spicer sounded semi-apologetic to reveal she was running as a Democrat. But she was prepared. She likes to tell voters, as she did here, that Wisconsinites are independent, and they vote for the candidate, not the party. The woman took some literature — Spicer pointed out that her cell number was on there, for any questions or concerns — and said she would think about it. Another potential voter, a young man wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, answered “huh” when Spicer asks what his concerns were. He said he hadn’t voted since he was 18; he was too busy with work at the dairy farm and at his grandparents’ house. “I think both sides equally suck,” he said, but “I honestly never have complained to a politician. Don’t know how.” Spicer suggested: “Maybe you should start.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/28/52/f28d7fdf4f7cb10f42dc120f0d30/20221013-wis-voters-17.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Unlike for the U.S. Senate, there is no majority at stake in Wisconsin’s legislative races: That does and will continue to belong to Republicans, due to the way Republican-controlled legislatures have drawn the districts. (A common Democratic complaint in the state is that, while Wisconsin voted 49.4/48.8 in favor of Biden over Trump in 2020, Republicans control 58 percent of the seats in the state Assembly and 64 percent of the seats in the state Senate.)

At a debate watch party in the Sauk Dems’ office, which shares space with a flooring store in a strip mall in the county seat of Baraboo, a spectator grumbled when Michels vowed to leave abortion access up to the legislature which, Michels said, represents the people of the state. “Not in Wisconsin, it doesn’t,” said the Sauk Democrat. The Democratic chair for the county is Tammy Wood, who sports blue highlights in her hair and is fired up for November. “I’m feeling good about it all,” she told me after the debate. She says she’s not even worried about Mandela Barnes’ lackluster recent polling against Ron Johnson, that it’s remarkable Dems are running so close to Republicans while their party is in power nationally. “But we’re gonna have to bust knuckle to make it happen. … We cannot go back to that same ‘divide and conquer’” that she says characterized the Scott Walker era.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/03/d4/2487527645e799a1f6f1ee6fcc6d/secondary8.jpg\"> <br> <p>But the county Republicans are feeling good, too, their former county chair Scott Frostman told me, especially with <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/12/poll-johnson-widens-the-lead-over-barnes-for-senate-seat-in-wisconsin-00061518\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666909814166,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666909814166,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/12/poll-johnson-widens-the-lead-over-barnes-for-senate-seat-in-wisconsin-00061518&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-1b91-ddd7-afd7-1fd137090001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Johnson leading Barnes&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-1b91-ddd7-afd7-1fd137090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Johnson leading Barnes</a> by the Wisconsin-comfortable margin of six points in the latest Marquette poll. Frostman believes that, given the economy, Democrats don’t have much to run on, and he said people don’t bring up the abortion issue much when he knocks doors, albeit Republican and independent-leaning ones. Michels, meanwhile, had recently gotten the endorsement of the Tavern League, the trade group for bars around the state, which he’d accepted at a bar in Baraboo. Frostman, too, admits the elections will come down to turnout, and that there’s no real predicting what Wisconsin voters will do. He noted that, while Republican Governor Scott Walker ultimately lost to Evers by a narrow margin in 2018, the progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin won her Senate race by a much larger margin that same year. “I’m like, how do you cast a vote for Scott Walker and then vote for Tammy Baldwin?” he said. “It’s a strange world, and this political stuff … it’s all strange.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e5/ba/bad6dc324ed38bd41d8d4a10f4f4/20221014-wis-voters-33.jpeg\"> <br> <p>At the Downtowner bar in Baraboo — which, incidentally, was the first home of the Ringling Brothers Circus nearly a century and a half before this year’s political circus — Matt Schmidt said he leaned right but didn’t feel too strongly about it. He’s a musician and self-described “tawdry redneck,” and he was looking forward to an upcoming gig in the Wisconsin Dells and pretty happy with life in general. To the extent I could find a political consensus in close-split Sauk County, Schmidt summed it up the best of anyone. “If you’re on the extreme of either side,” he said, “you’re part of the fuckin’ problem.”<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"SAUK COUNTY, Wis. — One recent Friday, the town of Reedsburg’s most famous resident was caffeinating while she mixed up coleslaw in a big blue bowl. I’d picked up a Culver’s coffee for her on my way because I felt sheepish: Kari Walker deals with reporters every time an election rolls around, because she happens to own a bar and restaurant in the politically swingiest county in one of the politically swingiest states in the country, and it’s one that tends to pick winners.\n Everybody, she says, wants to know what “secret sauce” accounts for Sauk County’s uncanny record, including voting for the victor in 10 of the last 11 presidential elections; it’s one of only two counties in the state that swung from Obama to Trump and then back to Biden, and Reedsburg itself had gone with the winning candidates in Wisconsin governors’ and Senate races dating back to 2010. “I’ve been on the TV in France,” she’d told me on the phone the night before. Also on CNN, and in Reuters and Agence France-Presse — appearances I’d learned about from a 2020 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article\",\"_id\":\"00000184-1b67-d3a9-afb4-7f6701f10000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article, which featured her third interview with that paper alone.\n Walker does not, however, overpromise in the manner of many other pundits. “Everyone descends because they’re hoping somebody is going to crack the code,” she said, but “I don’t think the code is crackable. You know, we’ve got 50,000 people in Sauk County, and in 2016, Trump won by 109 votes.” In 2020, he lost the county by 615. These are not margins that lend themselves to sweeping conclusions. Still, Walker ran through the spiel about life in her purple county, how if there are six people sitting at the bar, three voted for Trump and three for Biden in 2020, and she knows all of them and where they work and what they drink and what they drive.\n If Wisconsin is one of the nation’s premier political battlegrounds, Sauk County is the battleground within the battleground, where the party lean is unpredictable and elections swing by hair’s-width margins. It contains left-leaning tourist towns in the Wisconsin Dells and liberal spillover from the college-town-cum-capital-city of Madison, as well as conservative rural villages and manufacturing centers. If you spot a parade of signs for Republican candidates sticking out of a lawn or a cornfield, or even the rare “Fuck Biden” flag flapping in the wind, you’re seldom far from a procession of signs for Democrats, or maybe even a “LOCK HIM UP.” (“Him” being Trump.)\n \n  \n In this way Sauk mirrors the electoral closeness of the state as a whole, where four of the past six presidential contests were decided by less than a percentage point. Now, as the state faces high-profile contests for its governorship and a U.S. Senate seat that could determine which party controls the whole chamber — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, hoping to hold onto their jobs — Sauk County is a good place to study just what makes Wisconsin so, for lack of a better word, Wisconsiny.\n Because Wisconsin, at least judging by its current vicious and expensive campaigns, is not so much purple as polarized; it’s a state where “median voter theorem” goes to die. You might expect politicians in such a closely divided electorate to tack toward the center, take for granted their bases’ votes and cultivate just enough ideological crossover appeal to get to 51 percent. But another way to deal with such an even split is to prioritize turnout over persuasion, which means activating a party’s core of most likely voters, which means stoking partisanship and elevating extremes. By no means is the “base election” a Wisconsin innovation à la unemployment insurance or the ButterBurger — some credit Karl Rove with the nationwide 21st-century version — but the state does dramatically show off the result. Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate delegation is perhaps the most polarized in the country, with the same state having sent to Washington, not two moderates, but one of the Senate’s most conservative members in Johnson and one of its most liberal in Tammy Baldwin.\n \n  \n “Everything makes a big difference when the race is decided by 23,000 votes,” said Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “So both parties think everything matters” — like, say, the ballot drop boxes and election-related grant money that fueled a widespread and mistaken belief among Republicans that Joe Biden did not win the state fairly in 2020. “The paradox of really close elections in a very polarized partisan environment is the parties pay an awful lot of attention to pandering to their base, because they absolutely need every partisan vote they can get.” Franklin traces the state’s sharp polarization back to the era of Republican Governor Scott Walker and the fights over public-sector unions beginning in 2011, which he says poisoned intra-party cooperation and helped usher in a winner-take-all partisanship. This well-predated the Trump-related polarization that has since swept much of the rest of the country. “I’m not sure it’s really an honor,” Franklin says, “but we were there first.”\n The problem for normal Wisconsinites is that most of them aren’t really anybody’s base; many I spoke to in Sauk don’t feel represented by the extremes of either party. Kari Walker (the Reedsburg chef, no relation to Walker, the former governor) herself was a somewhat disengaged Republican until Trump ran, and she used to consider herself pro-life as well. Now she listens to “Pod Save America” or the Jan. 6 hearings while she cooks, and she organizes letter-writing campaigns for Democrats. “Democracy is my top issue,” she said. “And my second issue would be reproductive rights.” (Wisconsin abortion clinics have ceased operation since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, under an 1849 state law that bans abortions.) I also met people in Sauk who weren’t Republicans until Trump ran, who maybe didn’t love the tweeting but certainly dislike this current inflation-rattled economy much more. My conversations in Sauk County mirrored the results of Franklin’s latest poll for Marquette: There’s almost no overlap in the top issues for likely Democratic and likely Republican voters. For Democrats it’s gun violence and abortion; for Republicans it’s inflation and crime.\n \n  \n Five minutes or so down East Main Street from Walker’s restaurant, Wisconsin Metals has a “help wanted” sign out front in search of a fabricator. The manager, Sean McNevin, took me through the warehouse and explained how helium shortages and various supply-chain issues are affecting the business, which buys metals from mills and cuts them up to sell to manufacturers. Notwithstanding politicians’ vows to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest, McNevin said many of his manufacturing clients can’t find enough workers. “It’s a very strong environment for manufacturing.” His top issue is the economy, which he said was now like a roller coaster for a lot of industries, “and we’re just waiting for that drop.” He was noncommittal when I asked for his own views on the midterms but thinks it’s likely that both the Democratic governor and the Republican senator will win in November, because Wisconsinites won’t want to give either party carte blanche.\n By Election Day, by one estimate, Wisconsinites will have endured some $344-million worth of political advertising, much of which seeks to paint the top candidates on either side as “too extreme” for the state. Voters are set to determine whether abortion will remain illegal, how voting will work in their state, who gets to certify the results of the 2024 presidential election, and possibly which party controls the U.S. Senate. Sauk County offers a glimpse into the split mind of Wisconsin on all of these issues, in a state where many people seem sick of politics, but the politics only seem to get worse, because tiny margins can have big results, and each party sees the stakes as existential.\n For swing voters like McNevin, it can all be a bit tiring. “It feels like we’re being punished for something.”\n \n  \n  \nOn one extreme of Sauk County politics lies Sauk City, birthplace of the iconic midwestern fast food chain Culver’s, which has a population of about 3,500 and which Biden won by 28 points in 2020. On the other, a mere 24 miles to the northwest, is Rock Springs, with less than one-tenth of the population at barely 300 people, where Biden lost by 42 points. “What’s interesting about Sauk County is that the denser the population is even within the county, the bluer it is,” said Franklin. “And when you get into the open countryside, the redder it is.”\n Sauk City, on the blue end of the color spectrum, is an old farm-town but also a commuter haven for Madison liberals; on its outskirts, the family-owned Dorf Haus supper club is an area favorite for fish fry and German food. (As for what distinguishes a “supper club” from a “restaurant,” family member Mitch Maier isn’t exactly sure but thinks a supper club probably needs a deer head on the wall and a reputation for stiff cocktails to qualify). Friday night patrons feigned reluctance to talk about politics, but it was pretty easy to get them going. Maybe that had something to do with the generous brandy Old Fashioneds Mitch’s brother Monte was serving.\n “It’s very divided,” said a woman named Peggy who declined to give her last name. She had no interest in further alienating anybody; she said her godchild had already unfriended her on Facebook, and her liberal friends were “very staunch,” to the point that “politics have become: ‘Well, you’re stupid,’” she said. “They elected a guy with Alzheimer’s, so who’s stupid? … I’m not a Trumper, we just can’t keep doing what we’re doing.” Her husband, Jim, is 75, a Vietnam veteran and former Democrat who said he switched parties in 2016 because “there was no way I was gonna vote for Hillary.” Now he feels Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes is too far left for the state and finds Johnson to be the better choice, but he said it’s hard to get good information. “You can’t believe what anybody says anymore,” he said. “That’s just scary.”\n A young couple, Robert Hanson and Samantha Steur, listened to this analysis and stayed largely quiet, except to agree that politics was too divisive, even in Wisconsin’s supposed bastion of Midwest nice. They opened up later at their table, over the schnitzel and spaetzle, where Steur observed that “the left is too far left and the right is too far right” — including Barnes and Johnson respectively. “We’re middle-of-the-road people,” Hanson put in: Both want politicians to try to bring folks together, and the couple sees little of that in the state’s current crop. Hanson feels alienated by the identity politics of the left, but said his top issue is democracy, and he can’t stomach voting for a Republican.\n \n  \n Meanwhile, said Steur, “There are two Wisconsins. There’s the one in downtown Madison, and there’s the one at dive bars in Prairie du Sac,” the town adjacent to where we were sitting. “I love both of them. … I don’t know how to build the bridge — or rebuild it, if there ever was one.”\n Rock Springs is a chunk of the other, redder Wisconsin, and that’s where Ken Pieper sells popcorn from an old-timey wagon about a block away from a mead distillery. Pieper owns River Creek Popcorn, which used to operate out of a storefront until floods ripped through the small downtown and destroyed it. Now, he’s conveniently situated outside his own house, which sports a sign on the lawn for Tim Michels, the Republican challenger to Evers. “There’s a stupid part of this, too,” Pieper said of working so close to home. His former sunroom is overrun with popcorn paraphernalia.\n He and his brother Dennis stepped out of the wagon to sit on a bench in the chilly sunshine and talk politics, which they usually try not to do, since they’re on opposite sides. Both grew up in Sauk County, on a farm about a mile outside of town, and Ken has a simple explanation for how his brother’s political path diverged from his own. “Ding-a-ling went to work for the teachers union.”\n Ken hopes Michels wins the governor’s race because “education in Wisconsin is trashed. … I don’t think it was necessarily [Evers] that trashed it, but he ain’t necessarily helped.” (Dennis interjected: “It was Scott Walker that trashed it. I taught for 35 years, so I know.”) Ken just hopes Michels, a wealthy businessman and political novice in Wisconsin who got Trump’s endorsement and then won the GOP primary, won’t be another Trump. Ken likes some of what Trump did for the country, but “If he’d stayed off Twitter and learned to zip his trap, he would’ve been a whole lot better politician. … That kind of worries me about Michels, I mean, he is kind of a Trump person.”\n The Ken/Dennis divide encapsulates the right/left divide in the midterms: For Ken, the economy is the top issue, and for Dennis, it’s abortion. “The economy was already starting to go downhill badly already when Covid came in,” Dennis said. “So how can you say it’s a Democratic thing when basically it’s been here for four years already?”\n There followed a semi-friendly bickering match over whether Mandela Barnes is too far left.\n Dennis: “And you’re thinking your guy isn’t too far right?”\n Ken: “You can’t get any farther left than with Mandela Barnes.”\n Dennis: “In what way?”\n Ken: “Pro-abortion, large federal government, expansion of the government …”\n \n  \n Dennis: “You don’t think Obamacare was good?”\n Ken: “Not especially. It still was aimed at getting bigger government. … It’s states’ rights, not federal government, that needs to run this country.”\n Dennis: “So what’s wrong with abortion right now? They’ve given it to states’ rights and now every state’s against every other state.”\n Ken: “It always was states’ rights. It’s your nutty Supreme Court people called it something else.”\n Dennis: “But I think at that time it was still five-four in favor of Republicans. …”\n Ken: “It was a highly liberal Supreme Court. So don’t give me that nonsense.”\n And so on, down what was clearly quite familiar, and tiresome, terrain to them both. The political conversation dissipated fairly soon into Midwestern sports teams, about which they’re more in agreement, and a bit later the two got back to selling popcorn, wedged with their incompatible worldviews into the same small wagon.\n They seem to make it work the way Ken said the rest of the county gets along: “It’s kind of a mutual ignoring of the issues.”\n \n  \n  \nJust over the county line on a Saturday morning, Leah Spicer and her sister Moriah pushed a stroller containing Moriah’s baby with a “LEAH SPICER FOR STATE ASSEMBLY” sign sticking out of the top. The kid mostly napped while Spicer knocked on doors and introduced herself to potential voters in the 51st District, the most competitive of the three assembly districts that contain parts of Sauk County. (Of the two others, naturally, one is held by a Democrat and the other by a Republican.)\n Spicer is a 29-year-old Democrat hoping to unseat the four-term Republican Assemblyman Todd Novak. She thinks she’s got a decent shot, although the district is R+1, and a CNalysis state legislative forecast favors Novak. She points out Novak won his first race by 65 votes, although last cycle he had his best margin ever with 1,258 votes (out of about 30,000 cast in the race). Spicer jumped in when she saw no one planned to challenge Novak this year, because she doesn’t feel Republicans are representing the state well. “They have drawn the districts in such a way that they can maintain their political power without listening to their constituents,” she said.\n The district being what it is, when potential voters answer the door, she doesn’t lead with her affiliation. “I’m a little bit nervous about tying myself to the Democratic Party,” she told me. “There’s a lot of mistrust, I think, in politics in general, just like it’s something that happens far away. Politicians don’t represent us well, understand our communities, and I’m really trying to run as like a rural politician, who lives here, who understands.” She ticked off her own personal concerns: Three kids in rural public schools she says are under-funded; a small business, a restaurant she owns in the (liberal) Sauk County village of Spring Green, struggling with costs; aging parents on Social Security; family farm vulnerable to climate change. “In terms of political polarization, we’ve got to brush all that aside,” she said. “Especially in rural areas” — she gestures at the surrounding village of Lone Rock, which bills itself as “the coldest in the nation with the warmest heart,” where the trees have lately burst into bright reds and oranges — “this is all we have. There’s not a lot of people out here. And so if we’re not working together, it’s not going to work.”\n So when one older woman answered the door that morning, remarked that her concerns were “a lot of stuff — I think the federal government is ridiculous,” and asked if Spicer was a Republican, Spicer sounded semi-apologetic to reveal she was running as a Democrat. But she was prepared. She likes to tell voters, as she did here, that Wisconsinites are independent, and they vote for the candidate, not the party. The woman took some literature — Spicer pointed out that her cell number was on there, for any questions or concerns — and said she would think about it. Another potential voter, a young man wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, answered “huh” when Spicer asks what his concerns were. He said he hadn’t voted since he was 18; he was too busy with work at the dairy farm and at his grandparents’ house. “I think both sides equally suck,” he said, but “I honestly never have complained to a politician. Don’t know how.” Spicer suggested: “Maybe you should start.”\n \n  \n Unlike for the U.S. Senate, there is no majority at stake in Wisconsin’s legislative races: That does and will continue to belong to Republicans, due to the way Republican-controlled legislatures have drawn the districts. (A common Democratic complaint in the state is that, while Wisconsin voted 49.4/48.8 in favor of Biden over Trump in 2020, Republicans control 58 percent of the seats in the state Assembly and 64 percent of the seats in the state Senate.) But in some ways the stakes are even higher, because the question is whether Republicans will get a legislative supermajority that can override a governor’s veto, for which they would only need five additional seats in the Assembly and one in the Senate. Democrat Tony Evers has vetoed a record 126 bills this legislative session alone on wildly polarized issues from gun rights to school choice to unemployment benefits. Michels has vowed to sign them if elected, but with a legislative supermajority, Republicans wouldn’t even need the governor’s office to turn those bills into law.\n \n  \n Given how few competitive legislative districts are left, the Sauk County Democrats are hoping to gain some ground in the 51st. At a debate watch party in the Sauk Dems’ office, which shares space with a flooring store in a strip mall in the county seat of Baraboo, a spectator grumbled when Michels vowed to leave abortion access up to the legislature which, Michels said, represents the people of the state. “Not in Wisconsin, it doesn’t,” said the Sauk Democrat. The Democratic chair for the county is Tammy Wood, who sports blue highlights in her hair and is fired up for November. “I’m feeling good about it all,” she told me after the debate. She says she’s not even worried about Mandela Barnes’ lackluster recent polling against Ron Johnson, that it’s remarkable Dems are running so close to Republicans while their party is in power nationally. “But we’re gonna have to bust knuckle to make it happen. … We cannot go back to that same ‘divide and conquer’” that she says characterized the Scott Walker era.\n \n  \n But the county Republicans are feeling good, too, their former county chair Scott Frostman told me, especially with Johnson leading Barnes by the Wisconsin-comfortable margin of six points in the latest Marquette poll. Frostman believes that, given the economy, Democrats don’t have much to run on, and he said people don’t bring up the abortion issue much when he knocks doors, albeit Republican and independent-leaning ones. Michels, meanwhile, had recently gotten the endorsement of the Tavern League, the trade group for bars around the state, which he’d accepted at a bar in Baraboo. Frostman, too, admits the elections will come down to turnout, and that there’s no real predicting what Wisconsin voters will do. He noted that, while Republican Governor Scott Walker ultimately lost to Evers by a narrow margin in 2018, the progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin won her Senate race by a much larger margin that same year. “I’m like, how do you cast a vote for Scott Walker and then vote for Tammy Baldwin?” he said. “It’s a strange world, and this political stuff … it’s all strange.”\n \n  \n At the Downtowner bar in Baraboo — which, incidentally, was the first home of the Ringling Brothers Circus nearly a century and a half before this year’s political circus — Matt Schmidt said he leaned right but didn’t feel too strongly about it. He’s a musician and self-described “tawdry redneck,” and he was looking forward to an upcoming gig in the Wisconsin Dells and pretty happy with life in general. To the extent I could find a political consensus in close-split Sauk County, Schmidt summed it up the best of anyone. “If you’re on the extreme of either side,” he said, “you’re part of the fuckin’ problem.”","dc:creator":"Kathy Gilsinan","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/f0/fd/d0be8e6f4961ade31562fec8cb3b/lede.sauk.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Photographs by Andy Manis for POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Wisconsin voters watch a televised governor’s debate at the Sauk County Democratic Party headquarters in Baraboo, Wis., between incumbent Gov.

A report about the Obama administration organizing a shipment of pallets of money to Iran in connection with the nuclear deal got major attention. “Indeed, Mr. Azima was a source for Mr. Solomon, who had also exposed certain illegal dealings of the racketeering enterprise with Mr. Azima’s help,” the complaint explains.</p> <p>Meanwhile, according to both lawsuits, a cinematic array of violent retaliations against critics of the RAK regime were afoot: kidnapping, robbery, torture, all allegedly designed in part to stop people from squealing about dealings with Iran.

He kept his job at the time, but when the Associated Press reported on the correspondence six months later, he was given the gate. It’s easy to see why: In reviewing tens of thousands of pages over eight years, the reporters turned up emails that seemed to show the two men bandying about business ideas, with Solomon saying things like, “Our business opportunities are so promising” and Azima wishing him luck on his “first defense sale” when he was supposed to deliver a $725 million proposal to the UAE government. Solomon denied everything other than mismanaging a source relationship, but it wasn’t a good look.</p> <p>These days, Solomon too is affiliated with a D.C. think tank, and isn’t trying to litigate his way back into journalism’s good graces. Instead, he’s calling the case a cautionary tale — not just for journalists who blur lines with sources, but for people who think working in Washington institutions means everything’s on the up-and-up.</p> <p>“This case illustrates how powerful individuals and entities can deploy vast resources and spend vast sums with the aim of silencing a journalist,” Solomon said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Noel J. Nudelman. “And it’s a trend that’s becoming a greater threat to journalism and media, as digital surveillance and hacking technologies evolve and become more potent and pervasive. This is a major threat to the freedom of the press. And steps need to be taken to protect journalists and their ability to do their important work.”</p> <p>But it’s probably a bit more complicated than that, and not just because Solomon’s email trail essentially provided his alleged tormentors the matches with which to torch his career. It wasn’t actually Solomon’s email that was accessed — it was that of a source who had spent a career involved in sensitive work in what amounts to a bad geopolitical neighborhood.</p> <p>In the same way, the same month as Solomon’s firing, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, was the subject of a celebrated hack that led to the release of his correspondence with a variety of Washington players, many of whom had once assumed that they, too, lived in a safe world.</p> <p>“Jay and I came to the conclusion that we were both hit by the same mercenary hackers albeit hired by two different clients,” Otaiba told me this week.</p> <p>Indeed, the hostility between Iran and its Gulf neighbors, and the related standoff pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE, has a way of spilling into Washington controversies, from the downfall of Brookings Institution President John Allen (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/17/john-allen-brookings-institution-fbi-qatar-00040380\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/17/john-allen-brookings-institution-fbi-qatar-00040380&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890f000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890f000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank</a>, he was never charged but did lose his job, something that was cheered by many Beltway opponents of the emirate) to the release of emails of folks like Otaiba and Solomon (both of whom tend to be viewed with suspicion by many of Qatar’s stateside admirers and by folks in favor of rapprochement with Iran). <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The AP reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890f000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b890f000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">The AP reported</a> on Thursday that the FBI is probing an ex-CIA operative for allegedly spying on Qatar’s rivals, including U.S. figures who the emirate fears are out to damage its relationship with Washington.</p> <p>Ironically, according to a researcher who has studied the increasingly prominent sorts of schemes like the one Solomon’s suit describes, the effect of all these email dumps may not be quite what their alleged sponsors hope.</p> <p>“The different Gulf states at that point on different sides of the Gulf crisis, split between Qatar and some of the others, were really trying to engage in U.S. politics in a big way, because securing U.S. political support for their side of the controversy was highly valuable,” says James Shires, a senior research fellow in cybersecurity at Chatham House in London, <a href=\"https://tnsr.org/2020/08/the-simulation-of-scandal-hack-and-leak-operations-the-gulf-states-and-u-s-politics/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tnsr.org/2020/08/the-simulation-of-scandal-hack-and-leak-operations-the-gulf-states-and-u-s-politics/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89100000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89100001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019</a>, including the one that led to Solomon’s emails going public. “Some of the ways they tried to do this was to do hack-and-leak operations that smeared the other side. … This kind of backfired a lot.

Nudelman. “And it’s a trend that’s becoming a greater threat to journalism and media, as digital surveillance and hacking technologies evolve and become more potent and pervasive. This is a major threat to the freedom of the press. And steps need to be taken to protect journalists and their ability to do their important work.”\n But it’s probably a bit more complicated than that, and not just because Solomon’s email trail essentially provided his alleged tormentors the matches with which to torch his career. It wasn’t actually Solomon’s email that was accessed — it was that of a source who had spent a career involved in sensitive work in what amounts to a bad geopolitical neighborhood.\n In the same way, the same month as Solomon’s firing, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, was the subject of a celebrated hack that led to the release of his correspondence with a variety of Washington players, many of whom had once assumed that they, too, lived in a safe world.\n “Jay and I came to the conclusion that we were both hit by the same mercenary hackers albeit hired by two different clients,” Otaiba told me this week.\n Indeed, the hostility between Iran and its Gulf neighbors, and the related standoff pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE, has a way of spilling into Washington controversies, from the downfall of Brookings Institution President John Allen (investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank, he was never charged but did lose his job, something that was cheered by many Beltway opponents of the emirate) to the release of emails of folks like Otaiba and Solomon (both of whom tend to be viewed with suspicion by many of Qatar’s stateside admirers and by folks in favor of rapprochement with Iran). The AP reported on Thursday that the FBI is probing an ex-CIA operative for allegedly spying on Qatar’s rivals, including U.S. figures who the emirate fears are out to damage its relationship with Washington.\n Ironically, according to a researcher who has studied the increasingly prominent sorts of schemes like the one Solomon’s suit describes, the effect of all these email dumps may not be quite what their alleged sponsors hope.\n “The different Gulf states at that point on different sides of the Gulf crisis, split between Qatar and some of the others, were really trying to engage in U.S. politics in a big way, because securing U.S. political support for their side of the controversy was highly valuable,” says James Shires, a senior research fellow in cybersecurity at Chatham House in London, who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019, including the one that led to Solomon’s emails going public. “Some of the ways they tried to do this was to do hack-and-leak operations that smeared the other side. … This kind of backfired a lot. When they got third parties to do the hacking and leaking, often either PR firms or law firms, the story became about the hack-and-leak operation, not the content of the leak.”","dc:creator":"Michael Schaffer","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/ab/dbd8f4ce47ccbd13b596e586ad25/capcity.Solomon.jpeg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/Photos by Reuters, iStock","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/ab/dbd8f4ce47ccbd13b596e586ad25/capcity.Solomon.jpeg"}}]},"content":"Jay Solomon claims that a major law firm and an array of others targeted him after he angered a Persian Gulf ruler.","contentSnippet":"Jay Solomon claims that a major law firm and an array of others targeted him after he angered a Persian Gulf ruler.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/28/reporter-suing-email-hack-fired-00063901","isoDate":"2022-10-28T08:30:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Olivia Olander","title":"Top Republicans reject any link between GOP rhetoric and Paul Pelosi assault","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/30/rnc-chair-gop-rhetoric-pelosi-assault-00064129","pubDate":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 10:37:23 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/76/56/3d17fcca47859d38a69ad2e125d3/ap22035679827946.jpg\"> <br> <p>Two senior Republicans pushed back Sunday at Democratic assertions that heated GOP political rhetoric contributed to the brutal assault of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul.</p> <p>Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel called it \"unfair\" that Democrats would draw a direct line between her party's villainizing of Pelosi and the Friday home invasion that left the speaker's husband hospitalized.

And National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who posted a video last week of himself firing a gun with the hashtag #FirePelosi, deflected a question about whether he should have used a weapon along with the hashtag. \n Instead, Emmer sought to contrast the media's treatment of the Pelosi attack with what he argued was a comparable lack of attention to the 2017 politically motivated shooting of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). \n \"I'm sure people like to talk about anything but what the Democrats have done to this country,\" Emmer said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \n The debate over political rhetoric's role in the Paul Pelosi attack, the perpetrator of which steeped himself in online disinformation about fraud in the 2020 election and other conspiracy theories, dominated the airwaves Sunday. On both sides of the aisle, major players broadly condemned the violence — even as they openly disagreed on the root causes, with some Republicans arguing that Democratic policies played a role.\n \n \n \"You can't say people saying ‘fire Pelosi’ or ‘take back the House’ is saying ‘go do violence.’ It’s just unfair,\" McDaniel said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" She blamed the Paul Pelosi attack on rising crime that she sought to connect to Nancy Pelosi's party: “If this weren’t Paul Pelosi, this criminal would probably be out on the street tomorrow ... This is what Democrat policies are bringing.\"\n Pressed in a tense exchange by CBS host Margaret Brennan, Emmer said he disagreed with the idea that his \"#FirePelosi\" shooting video may have been suggestive or risky. \n Florida Sen. Rick Scott, chair of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, separately suggested on CNN that \"horrible\" violence was in part a result of lower public trust in elections. (Officials on both sides of the aisle, including Trump-era attorney general William Barr, have affirmed that President Joe Biden's 2020 victory was not affected by widespread voter fraud.)\n \"Be poll watchers, so you can see that elections are going to be fair,\" Scott told voters. He also cited the beating last week of a canvasser for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who did not initially say he believed the attack was political but revised that in later reports. \n Poll watching is not a new a practice, but it's increasingly on the rise among conservatives and has been described as disruptive by some election officials in this cycle. Scott then called out former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams for suggesting Republicans are undermining elections. \n The assailant, David DePape, broke into the Pelosi family's San Francisco home early Friday morning and attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer, San Francisco police said. He called out \"where's Nancy?\" during the invasion, according to police. \n San Francisco Police Chief William Scott described the attack as “not a random act,” but police have not yet detailed a motive. DePape had zip ties with him when he entered the Pelosi home, according to a person briefed on the investigation, an element first reported by CNN. \n \n \n For three days running, Republicans have fielded Democratic fury that the attack on the House speaker's husband was related to their incendiary rhetoric — and laser focus on Nancy Pelosi. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) connected the violence to election denialism and intimidation on Sunday, saying too many Republicans have failed to speak up about the issue.\n \"[Nancy Pelosi] has been villainized for years, and — big surprise — it's gone viral, and it went violent,\" Klobuchar said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n New Twitter owner Elon Musk posted disinformation about the Paul Pelosi attack on Sunday morning, adding new heft to Democratic worries about whether false claims might gain a foothold on the platform under Musk's ownership. Later in the day, Musk deleted the tweet.\n Asked whether the attack means Republicans should tamp down their rhetoric in attack ads leading up to next week's midterm elections, Gov. Chris Sununu (R-N.H.) said, \"I don’t think there’s any need for the attack ads.\" \n \"Ignore the elections. She’s going to get reelected fine,\" Sununu said on NBC. \"I mean, let’s just make sure that she and her family are safe.\" Security should be extended to other members of Congress as well, Sununu said. \n Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) noted that former President Donald Trump has not yet publicly condemned the attack on Paul Pelosi. \n \"All of us in the wake of this attack on Paul Pelosi need to say that we're going to stop demonizing folks,\" Coons said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n Violent rhetoric \"can lead to violence by small number of Americans who think when we describe our political opponents as our enemies, we're calling for them to be attacked,\" he added.\n Notably, one retiring Republican serving on the Jan. 6 select committee aligned with Democrats in directly connecting the attack to ideas pushed by fellow members of his party.\n Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who has frequently broken with the rest of the GOP in speaking out against election denial, wrote on Twitter Friday: “[W]hen you convince people that politicians are rigging elections, drink babies blood, etc, you will get violence” — a reference to conspiracy theories embraced by some on the far right.\n Kinzinger also called out House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for his relatively muted public response to the attack, and said every Republican candidate and official should “speak out.”\n Nicholas Wu contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Olivia

No way.” She railed against “radical leftists” and the media – “those lying, propagandist bastards who are trying to bring this country down.”</p> <p>At one point, a man in the crowd called out, “We’ve got your six, Kari.”</p> <p>“Thank you, sir,” Lake replied. “Thank you, cowboy.”</p> <p>She said, “We have God on our side,” and she asked her supporters to raise their hands if they were “ready to vote like your lives depend on it.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/5d/ae/c83e8da54a9eb4498fad8109e928/siderslessecondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p><br></p> <br> <p><b>In Arizona, </b>violence hasn’t been just rhetorical.

Next to Lake on a debate stage, Hobbs would likely seem smaller — with the way she draws her elbows in when she addresses a crowd, and with a voice that does not fill the air like Lake’s. There would probably be a clip the next morning of Lake belittling her.</p> <p>But it didn’t strike me that Hobbs could not <i>survive</i> the encounter. She took questions from reporters at a handful of events I attended over the weekend in and around Phoenix, then took follow-up questions and, when I asked her campaign to talk to her once more, made her available again. She had one well-practiced applause line, referring to Lake as “the Trump-endorsed, election-denying, media-hating, conspiracy-loving GOP nominee.”</p> <p>At El Portal, Garrido Wilcox’s husband, Earl Wilcox, a former Arizona state lawmaker and former aide to former Gov. Janet Napolitano, said he understood Hobbs’ decision not to give Lake the platform of a debate. But he said, “We want her to be stronger … I would like for her to be more forceful, show some passion.”</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2f/70/ed345d2d48c2bb9b53502d896370/siderslessecondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p> Hobbs told me that, politically speaking, Lake is “not a bad candidate … She’s doing that Donald Trump model, where we do all these rallies and get everyone excited.”</p> <p>She said she always expected the race to be close and that her campaign is “very focused on what we have to do … to make sure that we are on the right side of that tight race.”</p> <p>Her critics, she said, are “getting caught up in the noise.”</p> <p>She said, “I know that people are worried because this race is so close, and there’s so much at stake, and it’s easy to get caught up in the ‘You’re not doing everything possible.’”</p> <p>She said, “We are.”</p> <p>Still, Steven Slugocki, a former Democratic Party chair in Maricopa County, the state’s population hub, told me Democrats are already discussing how to respond to “the chaos we could see over the next two years if [Lake, Finchem and Hamadeh] get elected,” anticipating if they win, that Democrats will be in court litigating over <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-suggests-early-voting-restricted-arizona-repeats/story?id=91920284\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Republican-led efforts to limit early voting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-suggests-early-voting-restricted-arizona-repeats/story?id=91920284&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89480008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89480009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Republican-led efforts to limit early voting</a> and otherwise make voting more restrictive.</p> <p>“It’s going to be a nonstop grind,” he said.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/44/4a/091206ca4f97bb1b78b00ab04393/siderslessecondary6.jpg\"> <br> <p><b>In 2020, </b>it was a Republican governor, Ducey, who <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/12/02/arizona-gov-doug-ducey-confirms-trump-called-during-vote-certification/3802735001/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1666823016868,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf0a-d5ef-ad97-bf7f0c940006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1666823016868,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf0a-d5ef-ad97-bf7f0c940006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/12/02/arizona-gov-doug-ducey-confirms-trump-called-during-vote-certification/3802735001/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-1660-d9f5-a1e6-9e7242b40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;silenced a telephone call&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-1660-d9f5-a1e6-9e7242b40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">silenced a telephone call</a> from Trump while signing papers certifying the election, the ringtone “Hail to the Chief” sounding on his phone.

Everyone was.</p> <p>“You feeling good?” said John Rich, the country singer who played after Lake spoke, and who described her as “like a well-spoken Arizona rattlesnake.” “You feel like you’re going to win?”</p> <p>The crowd roared, the smell of barbecue and kettle corn in the air.</p> <p><i>Steven Shepard contributed to this report&nbsp;</i><br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"MORRISTOWN, Ariz. — On a stage backed up to a rodeo ring between a barbecue restaurant and a petting zoo, dusk fell over the Arizona desert and several thousand Kari Lake supporters fell into prayer for Lake, the Republican nominee for governor, for “the army of patriots that you are raising up in this hour” and, ultimately, for a “divine turnaround” in Arizona.\n The event was a rally for Lake, and following the supporter who said the prayer, Austin Smith, a Republican state House candidate, told rallygoers they were “chosen” — a state of “pioneers, ranchers, working-class families” in conflict with forces of a “global world order.”\n “We want to make sure that Arizona is the Wild West, right?” he asked.\n \n  \n With their Lake flags and buckets of beer, the crowd erupted. The opening lines of AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” blared and Lake strode on stage.\n Two years ago, the current occupant of the office Lake is seeking, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, had certified Joe Biden’s victory, the first for a Democratic presidential candidate in the state since 1996, infuriating then-President Donald Trump and his supporters. The Republican state House speaker, Rusty Bowers, also resisted Trump’s pressure campaign, then testified before the Jan. 6 committee about it. Katie Hobbs, the Democratic secretary of state and, now, Lake’s opponent in the gubernatorial race, had overseen the election.\n If there is a center in American politics, in Arizona in 2020, that center held. But as I watched Lake take the stage, it wasn’t clear to me that it still would.\n Lake, a former TV anchor and one of the GOP’s most prominent election deniers, has said that unlike Ducey, she would not have certified the 2020 election. When she was asked earlier this month if she would accept the results of her own upcoming race, she replied, “I’m going to win the election, and I will accept that result.” Separately, she said she would accept the result “if we have a fair, honest and transparent election,” as though the integrity of the election was in any doubt.\n \n  \n \nIn recent polling, she has pulled slightly ahead of Hobbs.\n Meanwhile, Blake Masters, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate who denied the results of the 2020 election while more recently calling Biden the “legitimate president,” has been gaining ground in his run against Sen. Mark Kelly, while state Rep. Mark Finchem, a celebrity in election conspiracy circles, and Abe Hamadeh, a fellow election denier, have credible chances of becoming secretary of state and attorney general, respectively.\n It isn’t hard to see what that might mean for the next presidential election, in 2024. Looking around the state, false claims about the last election are already clouding the present one. Last week, with early voting in Arizona underway, two armed, masked men in tactical gear were seen observing a ballot drop box in Mesa, outside Phoenix. Elections officials were beginning to field complaints of potential voter intimidation, while law enforcement officials said they were stepping up security around drop box sites.\n “Craaaaazies,” Barrett Marson, a Republican political strategist in the state, told me when I asked him about the drop box observers in masks.\n But the whole state, he said, is “crazy.”\n \n  \n “There’s no doubt about that,” he said. “It’s going to be a long two years.”\n  To Lake, the campaign was something different. She called it all — the rally this past Saturday night, her rise in Arizona — the start of a “huge red wave.” And the frisson of excitement in the crowd, the combative rhetoric and the brutal imagery surrounding it suggested a real war at hand.\n In the parking lot at the ranch northwest of Phoenix where Lake addressed the crowd, amid palo verde trees, Tony Boulos, who was selling T-shirts, showed me one of his best sellers. It said, “It’s Time to Take Biden to the Train Station,” a reference to the remote location where dead bodies are disposed of in the TV show “Yellowstone.”\n “The conservatives, they aren’t troublemakers,” he said, pointing to the line of people streaming in. “They’ve just had it.”\n He was selling ammunition, too. “It’s Arizona, man!” Boulos said.\n A colleague of his turned a hot dog on a grill and told me, “Our state’s a hot point right now,” while inside on the microphone, Lake said she felt “like I’m on the road like a rock star, performing.” She called Hobbs a “coward,” while describing her own campaign as a “national movement … originating here in Arizona.” She lamented the state of immigration, homelessness and the economy under Democratic rule, and, shaking her finger, pledged that “we’re not letting them take this election like [Biden] did. No way.” She railed against “radical leftists” and the media – “those lying, propagandist bastards who are trying to bring this country down.”\n At one point, a man in the crowd called out, “We’ve got your six, Kari.”\n “Thank you, sir,” Lake replied. “Thank you, cowboy.”\n She said, “We have God on our side,” and she asked her supporters to raise their hands if they were “ready to vote like your lives depend on it.”\n \n  \n \n \n In Arizona, violence hasn’t been just rhetorical. In 2011, then-Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting outside of Tucson. Fourteen years before that, Mary Rose Garrido Wilcox, then a member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, was shot in the pelvis by a man who disagreed with her politics.\n On the day of the Lake rally, while Hobbs was talking with supporters at El Portal, the restaurant Garrido Wilcox owns in Phoenix. I asked Garrido Wilcox how the political climate in Arizona today compares to then.\n “It’s scarier now,” she said.\n Garrido Wilcox, a Democrat, is optimistic about her party’s prospects in next month’s elections. But Democrats here can read headlines just as well as anyone, and it’s become obvious that Lake is on a tear.\n In fact, to read some of the coverage – “Kari Lake and the Power of a Polished MAGA Message,” or “Why Kari Lake Is the Next Republican Star” – the election is already over. Lake, amid speculation that she could be a presidential or vice presidential contender, recently pledged to “serve eight years” as governor.\n “Kari,” one Democratic strategist texted me, “is going to be president at this rate.”\n \n  \n Part of the problem for Democrats is Lake’s appeal. Then there’s the midterm election climate, which is unfavorable for Democrats everywhere. Biden only won Arizona by about 10,000 votes. But the other thing making some Democrats uncomfortable is Hobbs, who by her own admission is not as “polished” as Lake, who refuses to debate and who strategists inside and outside of Arizona had privately been expressing concerns about all summer.\n When I asked one of them in the state to explain to me why he asked if I’d heard her speak.\n I’d seen the clip of Hobbs, at a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce forum, fumbling to answer a question about what she’d learned from the Latino community (her answer included mentioning “practicing my español … un poquito”), and there was the clip of her spilling her drink at a restaurant when, approached by a member of the conservative group Project Veritas, she moved quickly to get away. For her opponents, her unwillingness to debate was an opportunity to tie all of that up into one, broad hit on her as, as Lake puts it, a “coward.”\n At Lake’s rally, a supporter in a “Where’s Waldo” costume danced in the crowd holding a “Where’s Katie?” sign. Laurie Roberts, a columnist for the Arizona Republic, wrote that Hobbs’ debate avoidance was a “new level of political malpractice.” On CNN, Bakari Sellers, the Democratic TV pundit and former South Carolina state lawmaker, called it a “terrible decision.” And whether it was or not, it was the last thing Hobbs’ campaign wanted to be on voters’ minds in the closing weeks of the race.\n Hobbs had overseen one of the most contentious elections in American history in one of the most bitterly divided states – enduring death threats and protesters outside her home. And here she had allowed Lake to portray her as afraid.\n In an interview, Hobbs told me it was the “right decision” not to debate, dismissing the criticism as “noise.”\n \n  \n \n“I’m running against someone who has made it her entire platform to essentially dismantle democracy, and somehow the problem is that I don’t want to give her a stage to do that?” she asked.\n Lake, she said, is “only interested in a spectacle,” and “there’s really no upside to giving her that opportunity to turn this debate into that kind of spectacle.”\n It probably wouldn’t have been a winning night for Hobbs. Next to Lake on a debate stage, Hobbs would likely seem smaller — with the way she draws her elbows in when she addresses a crowd, and with a voice that does not fill the air like Lake’s. There would probably be a clip the next morning of Lake belittling her.\n But it didn’t strike me that Hobbs could not survive the encounter. She took questions from reporters at a handful of events I attended over the weekend in and around Phoenix, then took follow-up questions and, when I asked her campaign to talk to her once more, made her available again. She had one well-practiced applause line, referring to Lake as “the Trump-endorsed, election-denying, media-hating, conspiracy-loving GOP nominee.”\n At El Portal, Garrido Wilcox’s husband, Earl Wilcox, a former Arizona state lawmaker and former aide to former Gov. Janet Napolitano, said he understood Hobbs’ decision not to give Lake the platform of a debate. But he said, “We want her to be stronger … I would like for her to be more forceful, show some passion.”\n   \n  Hobbs told me that, politically speaking, Lake is “not a bad candidate … She’s doing that Donald Trump model, where we do all these rallies and get everyone excited.”\n She said she always expected the race to be close and that her campaign is “very focused on what we have to do … to make sure that we are on the right side of that tight race.”\n Her critics, she said, are “getting caught up in the noise.”\n She said, “I know that people are worried because this race is so close, and there’s so much at stake, and it’s easy to get caught up in the ‘You’re not doing everything possible.’”\n She said, “We are.”\n Still, Steven Slugocki, a former Democratic Party chair in Maricopa County, the state’s population hub, told me Democrats are already discussing how to respond to “the chaos we could see over the next two years if [Lake, Finchem and Hamadeh] get elected,” anticipating if they win, that Democrats will be in court litigating over Republican-led efforts to limit early voting and otherwise make voting more restrictive.\n “It’s going to be a nonstop grind,” he said.\n \n  \n In 2020, it was a Republican governor, Ducey, who silenced a telephone call from Trump while signing papers certifying the election, the ringtone “Hail to the Chief” sounding on his phone. And when he opposed Lake in the Republican primary — supporting, along with former Vice President Mike Pence, a more traditionalist Republican, Karrin Taylor Robson – Lake’s election denialism seemed to matter to him. He cast Lake as a “fake” and said she was “misleading voters with no evidence” about the result of the election.\n But all of that changed once Lake became the Republican nominee. Ducey, who had been censured by the state Republican Party for his disloyalty to Trump, told the Arizona Republic he “just reject[s]” discussion “about democracy being fragile.”\n Lake is the “superior candidate,” he said.\n And Ducey isn’t the only establishment-minded Republican who is feeling differently about Lake now than before. On the day after the primary, Bill Gates, the Republican chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, told me “the election last night was a catastrophe for the Arizona Republican Party and, I would argue, our democracy.”\n But when I spoke with him this week, Gates said he was at least holding out the possibility that Lake, if elected, “once she’s in the chair, is going to certify the results of an election as they are.”\n “I don’t know that,” he said. “I’m just saying I’m hoping. I have hope for that.”\n \n  \n Lots of Republicans do. Stan Barnes, a former state lawmaker and Republican consultant in Arizona, told me “all the noise around the democracy being threatened is, I believe, heaped upon us and exaggerated beyond belief to serve one political party that has nothing else to talk about this election cycle.”\n Lake, he said, would be “bolder and far more candid than traditional governors,” but from a policy perspective would likely be “very mainstream Republican.”\n If that sounds like what many Republicans said about Trump in the run-up to his election in 2016 or even his defeat in 2020 – when they suggested Trump was saying things he didn’t mean or wouldn’t do — it is. Even Bowers, who lost his primary earlier this year to a Trump-backed challenger who said the devil was at work in the 2020 outcome, told me he has no opinion about whether Lake would be a good governor and didn’t know if he would vote for her.\n “She’s been very vocal about the steal,” he said. “But there’s a lot that a governor does that is not about a steal.”\n But for many Republicans in Arizona, it is still very much about the 2020 election.\n The night before Lake’s rally, I drove to the site of a ballot drop box in Mesa where two sheriff’s deputies were measuring the distance between the box and a spot in the parking lot where a 59-year-old woman and her son (“I came for the free food,” he said,) were eating popcorn and Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers. From her blue camp chair, the mother watched the ballot box.\n   \n “It’s just about the ‘2,000 Mules’ movie,” said the woman, who identified herself only as Andrea, referring to the widely discredited film about 2020 election fraud. “Did you see that? That’s bad stuff!”\n Andrea said she wasn’t sure the election was rigged, but she thought it was “unfair” and that people “don’t like being lied to.” The 2020 election, she said, at least got Republicans more involved in Arizona politics.\n “I think the fact that people are paying attention, they kind of woke us up,” she said.\n She described her presence as a deterrent to would-be-cheaters, and she waved amicably at a voter in a compact car who, after dropping his ballot, left with his middle finger up for her.\n “I think Republicans sat back and let things happen,” she said of 2020. “They didn’t want to get too involved.”\n Now, she said, “It’s like, we have to fight to get this back.”\n The next evening, at the Lake rally, that same fervor ran through the crowd. One man holding a large Lake flag told me he was “attracted to a politician who doesn’t bend over and take it in the ass,” while another predicted Lake will win “as long as we can keep the cheating down.” \n \n  \n He was confident they could. Everyone was.\n “You feeling good?” said John Rich, the country singer who played after Lake spoke, and who described her as “like a well-spoken Arizona rattlesnake.” “You feel like you’re going to win?”\n The crowd roared, the smell of barbecue and kettle corn in the air.\n Steven Shepard contributed to this report","dc:creator":"David Siders","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/d1/2d/4f069a3447b2be90f566d0bf39c0/siderslede.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Photos by David Siders/POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"A Donald Trump supporter grills sausages at the rodeo rally for the Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake on Oct. 22, 2022.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/d1/2d/4f069a3447b2be90f566d0bf39c0/siderslede.jpg"}}]},"content":"Arizona resisted election denialism in 2020.

Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a Friday statement. </p> <p>In Ohio on Saturday, Republican Sen. Rob Portman, campaigning alongside candidate J.D. Vance, Gov. Mike DeWine, and Rep. Steve Chabot at a canvassing event in the Cincinnati area was discussing crime and public safety with a small crowd of supporters when he turned briefly to the attack. </p> <p>“By the way, what happened yesterday to Speaker Pelosi's husband, none of us can tolerate that,\" Portman told a crowd. “We are not about violence.

In the Arizona GOP Senate primary earlier this year, for example, Jim Lamon aired an ad showing him shooting at actors pretending to be Pelosi, President Joe Biden and Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly. \n “Speaker Pelosi and her family in the space of 18 months have now been attacked at her place of work and at her home,” Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss told POLITICO in an interview Saturday. “It is a symptom of an unhealthy political culture. And GOP candidates, in particular, need to be mindful of their rhetoric on election night.” \n The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Kevin McCarthy-aligned super PAC, mentioned the speaker in at least 29 ads over the past week, according to Democratic strategists tracking the issue.\n “The attack is not an isolated event,” Barbara Walter, the political scientist and author of “How Civil Wars Start,” told POLITICO. “It’s part of a rising wave of domestic terror since 2008 — most by members of the radical right — who are targeting opposition leaders, minority groups and federal agents. This is their form of civil war and it is only likely to increase as our democracy remains weak and unstable, and our society deeply divided.” \n \n \n Publicly, elected officials, candidates and campaign committees expressed reluctance to comment on the record about increased security measures they were taking down the homestretch of the campaign. Multiple Democratic gubernatorial campaigns declined to comment on such procedures, and the Democratic Governors Association referred POLITICO to state police agencies. The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and several Democratic senate campaigns, meanwhile, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n Speaking at a Detroit campaign rally on Saturday afternoon, former President Barack Obama called on Republicans to turn down the temperature on violent rhetoric.\n \"If our rhetoric about each other gets that mean, when we don't just disagree with people but we start demonizing them, making crazy allegations against them, that creates a dangerous climate,” Obama said. “If elected officials don't do more ... people can get hurt.\"\n Former Vice President Mike Pence, who weathered the siege on the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump in the tense hours of Jan. 6 while working closely with Pelosi, decried the attack on her husband. “This is an outrage and our hearts are with the entire Pelosi family,” Pence tweeted Friday. \n \n \n  In an interview with POLITICO on Saturday, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who challenged Pelosi for the leadership in 2016, drew a line from the attack to extremist elements of the Republican Party — and to talkers on Fox News “making light” of the attack.\n “It’s repugnant what they’re doing,” said the Ohio Democrat, who was campaigning in Portsmouth, Ohio, in the closing days of his U.S. Senate race against Republican J.D. Vance. “J.D. Vance raised money for the insurrectionists. … These guys are so extreme, they’re stoking violence, they’re raising money for the people who try to overthrow the country, they blow it off, and this is what you get. And it’s sad.” \n In the wake of the Pelosi attack, at least one spouse of a political figure — Chasten Buttigieg, husband of Transportation Secretary and former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg — blamed Fox News for fomenting political attacks on his family. “If Fox News is interested in bringing down the tenor of political discourse, I’m happy to point them to their specific segment that increased targeted attacks on my family,” Buttigieg tweeted. “It’s not hard to forget, it’s our kids’ birthday.” \n On Saturday, Democratic Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman tweeted about a campaign sign set ablaze in what he said was “deep red Lawrence County.” As a well-known political figure, threats aren’t new for Fetterman, said a campaign aide. But in the last two to three weeks, Gisele Fetterman, Fetterman’s wife, has found herself amid an uptick of threats as well, the person said. \n \n Joe Calvello, Fetterman’s spokesperson, has also received threats of violence in recent days. He tied them to stories in conservative media about him following Fetterman’s debate with Mehmet Oz this week, when he said Fetterman “took it to Dr. Oz pretty fucking hard” in the media spin room. \n “Gateway Pundit puts out a story on me at 9:25 right after the spin room. That night I’m getting threats in my personal email,” he said. “The next morning, Fox News has a standalone story about me spinning in my colorful language. And then I'm getting more threats to my personal and work email. It's hard not to see a direct link here for me.” \n Gateway Pundit did not immediately respond to a POLITICO request for comment. \n A Fetterman campaign aide said that Fetterman has a security detail as lieutenant governor. “There is no place for violence and intimidation in politics,” Fetterman tweeted. “All Pennsylvanians should feel safe to show their political support.”\n Republicans, Auchincloss said, “need to be put on notice that their rhetoric has the potential to inspire political violence, and they need to be cognizant of the words that they are using, and the effect that it can have on instigating political violence.” For their part, some Republicans attempted to tamp down the political temperature in the hours after the attack. \n “As we wait to hear more, every single American needs to be lowering the temperature,” Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a Friday statement. \n In Ohio on Saturday, Republican Sen. Rob Portman, campaigning alongside candidate J.D. Vance, Gov. Mike DeWine, and Rep. Steve Chabot at a canvassing event in the Cincinnati area was discussing crime and public safety with a small crowd of supporters when he turned briefly to the attack. \n “By the way, what happened yesterday to Speaker Pelosi's husband, none of us can tolerate that,\" Portman told a crowd. “We are not about violence. What we're about is settling our differences at the ballot box, and that's what we're going to do.\" A voice in the crowd called out, “We're going to beat her at the ballot box.” Portman replied, \"Beat her at the ballot box, absolutely.\" \n Before the event, though, one woman in the back of the crowd confessed a small part of her felt that “maybe bad people deserve to have bad things happen to them.” Still, the woman said her hope for Pelosi’s husband’s health outweighed that impulse: “Godspeed on your recovery,” she said. \n Ally Mutnick, Zach Montellaro and Natalie Allison contributed to this story.","dc:creator":"Adam Wren, Holly Otterbein and David Siders","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/16/39/ecb4e3ca4792a19bff784af7daac/election-2022-michigan-governor-40023.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Carlos Osorio/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Former President Barack Obama called on Republicans to turn down the temperature on violent rhetoric, speaking at a Detroit campaign rally on Saturday afternoon.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/16/39/ecb4e3ca4792a19bff784af7daac/election-2022-michigan-governor-40023.jpg"}}]},"content":"With 10 days until the election, Democrats are warning of threats and Republicans are trying to tamp down rhetoric.","contentSnippet":"With 10 days until the election, Democrats are warning of threats and Republicans are trying to tamp down rhetoric.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/29/pelosi-attack-rattles-campaign-trail-00064117","isoDate":"2022-10-29T21:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"Michigan State suspends several players following tunnel brawl after Michigan game","pubDate":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 02:36:02 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/michigan-state-spartans\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan State</a> football coach Mel Tucker announced the suspension of four players who were involved in roughing up a Michigan player following the end of their game over the weekend.</p> <p>Tucker said in a statement late Sunday night Tank Brown, Khary Crump, Angelo Grose and Zion Young effective immediately.

Having made Trump synonymous with lying, deceiving and bigotry, that job has been largely accomplished. But the political landscape can’t be remade by mere denormalizing. The most horrifying thing about Trump’s constant lies is not that he convinces his supporters to accept them but that his supporters don’t care that much about whether he’s telling the truth as they do about his positions or affectations about the culture war, race, immigration, abortion, grievance, police, trade, guns and political elites. Trump knows that when he stretches the facts, the press will call him out on it. But he also knows that his supporters will perceive his falsehoods as symbolic truths and cheer. The press should continue its lie-spotting because it’s our mission, but critics like Sullivan are wrong to expect such vigilance to change every mind.</p> <p>Sullivan correctly urges reporters to increase its coverage of “election deniers” who dishonestly preach about a “stolen” 2020 election.

She would prefer more “thoughtful framing and context” in coverage. Who can oppose that? Likewise, she counsels better quality control of headlines and news alerts to prevent the further dissemination of lies. Count me in. But her notions that the press should pay less attention to polls and staff blow-ups don’t reflect the way politics are waged. Polls drive fundraising and endorsements, both of which are key to winning votes which is the point of an election. To ignore them would be like ignoring the overture to a symphony. And a candidate’s ability to assemble a solid staff is a good stand-in for how they’ll perform in office. The backstabbing that occurred in the Trump campaign only grew fiercer when he arrived in the White House.

Report on the party that has come to embody him. Talk with the people who vote for him. Explore the conditions of their lives. Dig into the issues that move them. Trace the lies that beguile them.” But isn’t that precisely what the press pack has been doing since Trump reentered campaigning?</p> <p>Packer adds a useful coverage suggestion in his kicker, writing that “when Trump says nothing new, ignore him.” But there’s evidence that the press is already doing so. His spurious Truth Social posts don’t get picked up the way his tweets once did, but then again, he’s not president now.

We were too soft on him in 2016, goes the drift. We handed a liar a megaphone and neglected to turn it off. We delighted in covering him because he delivered clicks. We failed to communicate how aberrant he was, thereby normalizing him. We let him blow through democratic norms.\n Such sentiments, expressed in full-throat by former Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan, but also echoed in part by pundit Bill Press, veteran journalist Marvin Kalb, journalist George Packer, and others, predictably comes paired with the advice that the “media” must radically rethink his coverage should he run again in 2024 as expected. The stories should highlight Trump’s mendacious, anti-democratic ways, and never amplify his lies. If we don’t reform our ways and he wins, we will be charged as accessories to democracy’s murder. Or something akin to that.\n But the notion that press “blunders” contributed to Trump’s victory — and that these blunders will elect him again unless the press corps corrects its ways — completely misreads 2016’s coverage. As I’ve written before, from the birth of his candidacy through Election Day, the press rode Trump like a donkey. In the opening weeks of his campaign, it reported and criticized Trump’s racist talk about Mexicans, recounted his status as a liar, billboarded his denigration of John McCain, corrected him when he blamed 9/11 on George W. Bush, charted his sleazy business practices, spelled out his policy ignorance, listed his flip-flops and recorded his misogynistic ways. No presidential candidate in memory outside of George Wallace received harsher coverage. If anything, the press denormalized Trump, rising to declare in unison in the summer of 2015 that the Trump campaign was not just grotesque but also toast.\n Despite this coruscating coverage, Trump polled at 30 percent going into the second Republican debate in mid-September 2015, an astonishing feat for a political newcomer in a field of 16. As the campaign progressed, the press poured more of the same on Trump — all deserved, mind you — uncovering his devious use of philanthropy, exposing his lies in fact-checking columns and shaming him for his Muslim-ban plan. Trump did find safe harbor at Fox News Channel and on Morning Joe, and the cable networks covered his rallies with real frequency. But the coverage reflected his status as the front-runner. By the time Trump had secured the nomination, he still commanded the airwaves over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But whose fault was that? Trump made himself available while Clinton consciously backed out of the TV spotlight, as the New York Times reported in a May 30, 2016 piece. Even so, the news about Trump was largely negative. The conservatives at the National Review published a special “Against Trump” issue in January 2016, and the Weekly Standard’s neocons took a similar anti-Trump slant. A full spectrum of the press warned us about who he was.\n \n \n Once Trump became president, his behavior didn’t change, nor did the critical coverage end. To those who say the press failed to properly call out Trump for his many lies, please consult the news clips. The press did refrain from calling Trump a liar for the first two years of his administration, but by June 2019 the press had overcome that reluctance, as the Washington Post’s Paul Farhi reported. “It’s (almost) official: The president of the United States is a liar,” Farhi wrote. “Nowadays, many in the news media are no longer bothering to grant Trump the benefit of the doubt. In routine news and feature stories, Trump’s dishonesty carries no fig leaf. It is described baldly.”\n Should the press have started calling Trump a liar earlier? Perhaps. I had no problem doing so in December 2015. But I wasn’t alone. The fact-checkers at FactCheck.org crowned Trump “The King of Whoppers’ the same month. PolitiFact awarded him “Lie of the Year” in 2015, 2017, and 2019. It’s worth mentioning that Trump’s capacity for lies increased as he settled into the White House, as the New Yorker’s Susan B. Glasser reported in August 2018: Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler logged 2,140 false claims by President Trump in his first year but twice as many (4,229) in the six months of 2018 leading up to Glasser’s piece. By 2018’s end, Trump had become recognized as such a profligate liar that Kessler had to devise a new unit of measurement to describe Trump’s insistence on repeated single falsehoods again and again. To the previous measure of lies on a one-to-four Pinocchio scale, Kessler instituted The Bottomless Pinocchio.\n Some critics insist that the press do more to denormalize candidates like Trump. Having made Trump synonymous with lying, deceiving and bigotry, that job has been largely accomplished. But the political landscape can’t be remade by mere denormalizing. The most horrifying thing about Trump’s constant lies is not that he convinces his supporters to accept them but that his supporters don’t care that much about whether he’s telling the truth as they do about his positions or affectations about the culture war, race, immigration, abortion, grievance, police, trade, guns and political elites. Trump knows that when he stretches the facts, the press will call him out on it. But he also knows that his supporters will perceive his falsehoods as symbolic truths and cheer. The press should continue its lie-spotting because it’s our mission, but critics like Sullivan are wrong to expect such vigilance to change every mind.\n Sullivan correctly urges reporters to increase its coverage of “election deniers” who dishonestly preach about a “stolen” 2020 election. But that’s just sending a telegram the press got long ago.

The same with the Washington Post. And the Los Angles Times. And the Wall Street Journal. It’s a great prescription but the patient has already taken the medicine.\n \n \n She makes other suggestions worthy of our consideration for how to cover a Trump 2024 bid. She would prefer more “thoughtful framing and context” in coverage. Who can oppose that? Likewise, she counsels better quality control of headlines and news alerts to prevent the further dissemination of lies. Count me in. But her notions that the press should pay less attention to polls and staff blow-ups don’t reflect the way politics are waged. Polls drive fundraising and endorsements, both of which are key to winning votes which is the point of an election. To ignore them would be like ignoring the overture to a symphony. And a candidate’s ability to assemble a solid staff is a good stand-in for how they’ll perform in office. The backstabbing that occurred in the Trump campaign only grew fiercer when he arrived in the White House. It’s not mere gossip.\n One critic of Trump coverage, the Atlantic’s George Packer, offers this suggestion for the media in 2024. “If Trump runs again, journalists would do better to follow the money that supports him. Report on the party that has come to embody him. Talk with the people who vote for him. Explore the conditions of their lives. Dig into the issues that move them. Trace the lies that beguile them.” But isn’t that precisely what the press pack has been doing since Trump reentered campaigning?\n Packer adds a useful coverage suggestion in his kicker, writing that “when Trump says nothing new, ignore him.” But there’s evidence that the press is already doing so. His spurious Truth Social posts don’t get picked up the way his tweets once did, but then again, he’s not president now. Even New York University press scholar Jay Rosen, who loudly disdains the conventions of political reporting concedes that covering somebody like Trump is “not as simple as ‘don’t amplify.’” He continues, “There are occasions when the public needs to know that a political figure is falsifying reality, or that a consequential lie is gaining traction, as with Stop the Steal.”\n None of this is to belittle those who implore the press to improve its game in 2024. As ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl put it succinctly last year, Trump presents unique challenges. “You’re covering essentially an anti-democratic candidate,” Karl said on Reliable Sources. “You’re covering somebody running in a system that is trying to undermine that very system.” But again, is there a newsroom in America that hasn’t internalized that lesson by now?\n \n \n Reporters and editors should never reflexively bat away criticism. If Trump runs again in 2024, which looks likely, they’ll need as many back-seat drivers as they can get. But a genuine reckoning on how to cover Trump in 2024 must take an accurate inventory of the way we’ve actually covered him.\n ******\n Send your favorite Trump lie to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"mailto:shafer.politico@gmail.com\",\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89320000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b89320001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

The 82-year-old husband of the speaker was hospitalized but expected to recover.\n \n \n Until now, the suspect was known to be part of a group of pro-nudist activists based across the Bay in Berkeley.\n A photo published by the San Francisco Chronicle, and released after his arrest, shows DePape presiding, fully clothed, over the wedding of otherwise nude activists outside City Hall in 2013.\n The paper said he was known as a “father figure” in a Berkeley group home that included a well known nudist activist known as Gypsy Taub. At the time of the wedding he was identified as a hemp jewelry maker. Wiener told the Chronicle that DePape was among a number of nude activists who protested around San Francisco in 2011 and 2012.\n \n \n In more recent years, DePape has embraced the false claims that the November 2020 election was stolen, reposting on Facebook — in an account since removed from the platform — bogus claims by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and others associated with the campaign.\n He reposted a video on YouTube denouncing the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as a “farce,” according to CNN.\n A blog featuring content authored by DePape offers a patchwork embrace of bigoted and fringe topics, including posts that feature anti-Semitic language, allege the existence of a “communist” agenda in schools and repeat many of the tropes of the online fever dream known as QAnon, which alleges without evidence that leading figures engage in pedophilia.\n \n An archived page from another, now-defunct website also attributed to DePape suggests fury toward the government, the mainstream media and corporate powers, decrying “the elites/ruling class” and “the people who rule you” while warning “Tech giants and private industry” have become “so powerful they could single handedly silence the people.”\n It was enough for many leading Democrats to conclude that toxic political rhetoric was behind the attack, even without authorities disclosing a motive. “While the motive is still unknown we know where this kind of violence is sanctioned and modeled,” Rep. Jackie Speier tweeted.","dc:creator":"Jeremy B.

All three women have spoken about the escalation of threats they’ve faced in the Donald Trump era.\n For Ocasio-Cortez, that included an anime video created last year by a fellow member of Congress, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), that shows him killing her. Gosar was later censured by the House, and while McCarthy privately told members it was wrong, he did not vote to punish his colleague.\n In her Saturday tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said: “@GOPLeader defended him.”\n The blame didn’t stop at McCarthy. Another Democrat, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), started a Twitter spatwith the firebrand GOP lawmaker, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), after he was unsatisfied with her condemnation of the Pelosi attack.\n “YOU called for Nancy Pelosi to be executed,@RepMTG,” an irate McGovern wrote. “YOU said she should be hung for treason.”\n The attack comes in the final two weeks of a tense midterm election, where both Republicans and Democrats have vilified their opponents in campaign ads. And Democrats say it’s that rhetoric — the GOP’s demonization of Pelosi in decades of ads — that has escalated threats against her and her family.\n For instance, the House GOP’s top super PAC has highlighted or mentioned Pelosi in at least 29 TV ads in the last week alone, according to Democrats tracking the issue. In all, Pelosi was mentioned in 860 ads since the start of this midterm cycle.\n The accused assailant, a 42-year-old California man, had asked “Where is Nancy?” before his assault of her husband.\n President Joe Biden on Friday evening directly tied those words to chants from pro-Trump rioters as they overran the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021. \n “We need to say it out loud,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.). “Militia maniacs, and other rightwing domestic terrorists have exploded because Republicans have spent years winking, nodding, and endorsing their extremism.”\n Olivia Beavers and Ally Mutnick contributed.","dc:creator":"Sarah Ferris","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/c5/6d/2493c818473a9da8ac759d609a43/congress-guns-55126.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Andrew Harnik/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Rep.

Gretchen Whitmer has an answer for Democrats at odds over whether to emphasize abortion rights or the economy in the campaign’s final days: the two issues are one and the same.</p> <p>With recent polls showing economic stress outranking abortion concerns, the embattled Democratic governor is making a pitch to voters and business owners: If they reelect her and pass a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights, she can lure employers and workers from neighboring states where anti-abortion laws have taken effect since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was overturned in June.</p> <p>“I’m going to be working to draw investment into Michigan once we lock women’s rights into law,” Whitmer said in an interview. “We have the best workforce, low cost of living, high quality of life and women can make decisions about their bodies. That’s the story I want to be able to tell.”</p> <p>There is growing anxiety among Democrats nationwide that outrage over the loss of abortion in more than a dozen states won’t be enough to push their candidates over the finish line in purple states like Michigan.

That’s what’s at risk here.”</p> <p>Other Democrats around the country are touting a similar message — using the final days of their campaigns to argue abortion and financial concerns are inextricably linked.</p> <p>Georgia gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams said in a recent interview that protecting the right to terminate a pregnancy helps individuals make economic choices about the size of their families as inflation surges.

Everyone is desperate,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who is in a tight contest to hold onto her swing district, told POLITICO. “So, are we going to be an open-minded state that believes in equality and rights? Or are we going to be a backwards-looking state? Businesses don’t like backward-looking states. That doesn’t help them attract young people. That doesn’t incentivize kids who go to U of M for four years to stay in the state when they graduate.”</p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/1e/5d/b6e6936c41aab369c75788b037ca/220711-michigan-abortion-ap-773.jpg\"> <br> <p>Whitmer’s administration points to data they’ve collected showing a lack of affordable childcare is the top reason women have struggled to rejoin the workforce — particularly during the pandemic. Susan Corbin, who leads the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity,<b> </b>added that protecting abortion rights will help stop the “brain drain” that has long plagued the state — graduates of Michigan’s top-tier colleges leaving for better prospects elsewhere.

Gretchen Whitmer has an answer for Democrats at odds over whether to emphasize abortion rights or the economy in the campaign’s final days: the two issues are one and the same.\n With recent polls showing economic stress outranking abortion concerns, the embattled Democratic governor is making a pitch to voters and business owners: If they reelect her and pass a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights, she can lure employers and workers from neighboring states where anti-abortion laws have taken effect since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June.\n “I’m going to be working to draw investment into Michigan once we lock women’s rights into law,” Whitmer said in an interview. “We have the best workforce, low cost of living, high quality of life and women can make decisions about their bodies. That’s the story I want to be able to tell.”\n There is growing anxiety among Democrats nationwide that outrage over the loss of abortion in more than a dozen states won’t be enough to push their candidates over the finish line in purple states like Michigan.

Her race is narrowing even as polls show strong support for the measure to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution to which she’s closely tied her campaign.\n \n  \n With less than two weeks before Election Day, she, along with Attorney General Dana Nessel and other Democrats on the ballot in the swing state, are warning that workers will flee if the amendment fails and the state’s long-dormant 1931 anti-abortion law takes effect, making it harder for businesses — particularly those in tech, health care and the service sector — to recruit and retain employees.\n “I hear from businesses all the time that they are feeling the weight of the ‘she-cession,’ meaning women leaving the workplace during Covid,” she said. “If we want women to come back into the workplace in Michigan, we better not take away their right to be full citizens and make decisions about their own health care. That’s what’s at risk here.”\n Other Democrats around the country are touting a similar message — using the final days of their campaigns to argue abortion and financial concerns are inextricably linked.\n Georgia gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams said in a recent interview that protecting the right to terminate a pregnancy helps individuals make economic choices about the size of their families as inflation surges.

Everyone is desperate,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who is in a tight contest to hold onto her swing district, told POLITICO. “So, are we going to be an open-minded state that believes in equality and rights? Or are we going to be a backwards-looking state? Businesses don’t like backward-looking states. That doesn’t help them attract young people. That doesn’t incentivize kids who go to U of M for four years to stay in the state when they graduate.”\n   \n Whitmer’s administration points to data they’ve collected showing a lack of affordable childcare is the top reason women have struggled to rejoin the workforce — particularly during the pandemic. Susan Corbin, who leads the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, added that protecting abortion rights will help stop the “brain drain” that has long plagued the state — graduates of Michigan’s top-tier colleges leaving for better prospects elsewhere. It’s a message Whitmer has pushed since at least this spring, when POLITICO obtained a draft opinion indicating the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe, and one she’s highlighted in interviews, speeches and at forums with business leaders.\n But Whitmer’s Republican challenger, Dixon, who has voiced support for abortion restrictions and has criticized the governor for Michigan’s economic struggles, dismisses these arguments as unserious.\n “I think that we can work on child care.

They also generally turn out in lower numbers overall and are more likely to drop out of the electorate in midterm years — though they were key to Biden’s 2020 victory, when turnout among voters under 30 was 11 points higher compared to the previous presidential election, according to <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;an analysis&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b895e000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b895e000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">an analysis</a> by researchers at Tufts University.

Democrats also have not redoubled efforts to encourage young voters to take advantage of voting options, said Jessica Alter, founder of Tech for Campaigns, a Democratic firm that works on voter turnout and state legislative campaigns and is working this cycle to target low-propensity young voters in Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p> <p>Tech for Campaigns was among the Democratic organizations that targeted young voters with messaging related to mail-in voting in 2020.

But young voters have contributed to a smaller fraction of that turnout compared to this time two years ago, according to interviews and a POLITICO analysis of voter data.\n The party has had high hopes that younger voters motivated by the Supreme Court’s scuttling of abortion rights and President Joe Biden’s cancellation of some student debt would turn out in force — and help them to defy losses that the party in power typically suffers in midterm elections. They could still show up to the polls on Election Day. But their disappearance from the ranks of early voters so far puts Democrats at a disadvantage, because the party still has to chase their votes instead of banking them ahead of Nov. 8.\n In North Carolina, which has a close U.S. Senate race and a set of state legislative races that could determine whether abortion remains legal in the state, the median age of voters who cast ballots through Oct. 26 was 66, according to state data. Voters aged 30 and younger account for just 5.4 percent of ballots cast so far, compared to 16.5 percent of those who voted early or absentee in 2020. Republicans’ share of the early vote is also slightly higher now than it was at the same time two years ago.\n \n \n The overall situation looks better for Democrats in Pennsylvania, where they have maintained a more than 50-point advantage in absentee ballots returned so far, a similar share to 2020. But that is still despite low participation there from young voters, who the party still needs to turn out in order to win the state’s U.S. Senate seat.\n “Democrats are going to need younger voters to come out on Election Day in order for the numbers to hold,” said Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm.\n Early voting data is not a crystal ball for the coming election: Operatives from both parties and political analysts are quick to note that shifting voter habits after the Covid-19 pandemic, changing laws and former President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to sow doubt about mail voting also make it hard to establish a solid early voting baseline.\n Young voters have historically been less likely to vote early or by mail than older voters. They also generally turn out in lower numbers overall and are more likely to drop out of the electorate in midterm years — though they were key to Biden’s 2020 victory, when turnout among voters under 30 was 11 points higher compared to the previous presidential election, according to an analysis by researchers at Tufts University. Voters in that age group went for Biden by an estimated 25-point margin.\n But the president’s approval rating among younger voters took a particularly sharp dip last year, raising doubts about their levels of participation in the coming election.\n \n  \n Another possible explanation for the lack of young voter representation so far might be decreased focus on early voting compared to prior years in the pandemic. Democrats also have not redoubled efforts to encourage young voters to take advantage of voting options, said Jessica Alter, founder of Tech for Campaigns, a Democratic firm that works on voter turnout and state legislative campaigns and is working this cycle to target low-propensity young voters in Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n Tech for Campaigns was among the Democratic organizations that targeted young voters with messaging related to mail-in voting in 2020. But much of that investment has fallen off this cycle, Alter said.\n “We’re not seeing the investment on the digital side, which is, we think, part of the reason that you’re seeing the drop in early voting about 18- to 30-somethings,” she said.\n The group’s message-testing this cycle found the most successful digital ads were ones that focused on the convenience of voting by mail. One Facebook ad targeting Michigan voters featured a popular meme of actor Chris Pine rolling his eyes with the words, “when my friends don’t vote by mail and make me wait in line with them on Election Day.”\n Recent polling includes a strong signal that young voters will ultimately turn out for Democrats. A Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll released on Thursday found 40 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 “definitely” planned to vote, a similar rate to the 2018 midterm election. Those surveyed favored Democratic control of Congress by a 26-point margin.\n TargetSmart’s Bonier pointed to Election Day turnout in special elections — which favored Democrats after the Supreme Court decision on abortion — as another reason to believe that young voters would turn up in force in November.\n \n “It isn’t going to be a typical midterm where the party in power is perhaps less engaged and they stay home and the party out of power sweeps,” he said. “Democrats are fired up.”\n The overall signals from early voting data have been somewhat mixed this far. The numbers from states like Georgia have hinted at potential record midterm turnout, as Republicans mobilized by the economy and frustration with President Joe Biden cast their ballots alongside Democrats upset about the end of Roe v.

A spokesperson for the group said the ad — a negative spot against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan — is set to hit airwaves on Wednesday, and Sentinel may add to its buy.\n Jessica Anderson, president of the super PAC, called the Army brigadier general a “political outsider” whose vote was needed to reverse Democratic economic policies. The group endorsed Bolduc earlier this month, and prior to the Senate primary spent $300,000 on a July ad attacking Hassan on gas prices.\n “General Don Bolduc will be the senator New Hampshirites need in Washington,” Anderson said in a statement to POLITICO. “His campaign is showing tremendous momentum in the Granite State, and it is time for the whole of the conservative movement to come together and support his bid to unseat Sen. Hassan.”\n \n \n Bolduc’s rise in the polls — which now show him tied or within the margin of error against Hassan — comes as Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a week ago it was slashing more than $5 million in remaining ad buys in the state in order to spend the funds in Pennsylvania.\n Sentinel Action Fund’s venture into New Hampshire mirrors its involvement in Arizona. In both cases, the new super PAC sought to fill a void left by SLF’s departure. In the case of Arizona, Republican Blake Masters began catching up with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after Sentinel Action Fund and a series of other GOP outside spending groups rushed in to buy up advertising time that SLF had canceled.\n SLF’s announcement last week to cancel its remaining investment in New Hampshire came two days after Bolduc reiterated he would still not support McConnell as Senate majority leader, a position he held during the primary.\n In the story, first reported by POLITICO, Bolduc said he was “not backing off” his past comments about the need for new leadership in the Senate. Masters earlier this year had also suggested a change in Republican Senate leadership.\n In the days since, two new Republican senators have endorsed Bolduc: Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Early next week, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, will travel to New Hampshire to campaign with him.\n Bolduc, an Army brigadier general who ran further to the right than his Republican primary opponents, has attempted to temper some of his positions after winning the party’s nomination. That includes reversing his past stance that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump, who ultimately did not endorse in the New Hampshire Senate primary.\n \n \n An internal poll released last week by Bolduc’s campaign, conducted by Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio, found Bolduc just two points behind Hassan, 49 to 47 percent. An Emerson College poll also conducted in mid-October showed a three-point race, while a Co/Efficient poll this week had the race tied.\n The recent surveys show Bolduc has pulled closer to Hassan since just after the Sept. 13 primary, when he was polling 7 to 9 percentage points behind the incumbent Democrat.\n Coupled with a lingering poor midterm environment for Democrats — Biden’s approval stands at just 40 percent in the state, Emerson and Co/Efficient found — the recent polling has urged Republican groups to step in and keep irons in the fire in New Hampshire.\n The NRSC, which canceled millions of dollars in scheduled advertisements in New Hampshire earlier this month, citing SLF’s presence in the state, this week said it would put $1 million back in. Other GOP super PACs, including Our American Century and Restoration PAC, have placed buys in the last week totaling $1 million.\n But Democrats continue to have a spending advantage in the final days of the race.

But it is.</p> <p>One clue is in plain sight as you look around during the boring few minutes it takes to top off your tank. Plopped in the corner of the lot like an afterthought are four vertical red slabs.</p> <p>They’re electric vehicle charging stations, capable of reviving an EV and its battery in about half an hour. It is no exaggeration to say they could be the most disruptive thing ever to confront that century-old fixture of the American roadside: the gas station. As more Americans<b> </b>drive their shiny new electric vehicles onto the highway and wonder where to go when the battery nears empty, charging stations are the agents of a revolutionary fill-up — not of gallons but kilowatts, not five-minute “stops” but half-hour “experiences” that could completely transform the tenor of the road trip.</p> <p>These pumps and plugs facing each other across the asphalt are also totems of an unseen battle. Two titans of the energy sector — electric companies and gas stations — have peacefully coexisted for a century but now find themselves vying for the right to serve electric vehicle owners. In just the last nine months, automakers have sold over 576,000 EVs, a 70-percent jump over the same period last year, according to auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. A burst of investment in both vehicles and chargers<b> </b>from automakers and the feds suggest that’s just the beginning. Ford and General Motors, America’s two biggest automakers, and the Biden administration have coalesced around a goal of electrifying half of new cars by 2030.</p> <p>Crucial to that future is a nationwide network of charging stations. Who controls those stations and the fuel coursing through them is the flash point of a fight between the electric utility and the convenience store. The outcome will impact where Americans charge their EVs and how much they pay.</p> <p>As both gas stations and power companies hang their future on the electric vehicle, the fight has gotten ugly. In fact, heads have already rolled. One electric utility, Southern California Edison, forced the resignation of a key lobbyist in order to kneecap the gas station industry as Congress considered President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging stations. The spigot of federal dollars only increased with the passage in August of the big federal climate-energy bill, stuffed with incentives to restructure the auto industry around EVs.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4d/4d/0c1d8d314dc3b86f529368c6f61e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.biden.jpg\"> <br> <p>This collision between electricity and gasoline is in sharp relief at Kum &amp; Go, a chain of almost 400 filling stations and convenience marts in 11 states that has invited the electric vehicle to disrupt its business model. Wellington is the final settlement of metro Denver before the plains spread north toward Wyoming. Alongside the grind of I-25, next to a McDonald's, stands the Kum &amp; Go with its sign advertising the latest price for unleaded. It’s one of six Kum &amp; Go stations in the state that have embraced electric vehicle charging. Other gas station chains sometimes host charging stations owned by someone else, often Tesla. But Kum &amp; Go has branded these stations in its red-and-white color scheme.</p> <p>In 2018, Kum &amp; Go set the goal of “being known as the place that has EV charging,” said Jacob Maass, the company’s commercial fuel manager. This year, as electric vehicles have begun to seem inevitable and the Biden administration spends big to construct a network of 500,000 fast-charging stations, some of the country’s biggest fueling chains have joined the parade, including Pilot Co. and 7-Eleven.</p> <p>But success hinges on resolving fundamental disputes over who has the right to sell electricity, and for how much.</p> <p>The supply chain that underpins the gas station — starting in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia or Texas and flowing through intermediaries to that big price on the sign — becomes something else entirely in the EV age. What replaces it is a system of stupefying complexity. The price a station host pays for the new fuel is determined by which of America’s 3,000 electric utilities the plugs happen to be connected to. This pricing system is invisible to the driver but presents an existential dilemma for gas station owners. They find themselves at the mercy of an opaque, highly regulated and monopolistic electricity system that is the exact opposite of the one they have thrived on for decades. </p> <p>EV charging involves “an electricity market structure that was not designed for — and is, not surprisingly, incompatible with — the retail fuel market,” said A.J. Siccardi, a fueling executive, in testimony to Congress last summer that caused sparks between the two camps.</p> <p>It is possible that gas stations and electric companies will sort through their thicket of disagreements so that gas stations can make money filling batteries, while also (strangely enough) becoming a cool place to hang out. Or it’s possible that the fueling station as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by battery refills in home garages, at workplace parking lots or at Starbucks, while the driver nurses a venti latte.</p> <p>In other words, these electric cubes on the Colorado roadside are either the dominoes that trigger the gas station’s revolution, or the headstones that mark its grave.<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">A</span>merica’s 20th-century economic growth was powered by the electric grid and the gas station. But as businesses, they couldn’t be more different.</p> <p>The gas station arrived in the early 1900s, soon after the car itself, and quickly became a cutthroat game. Because the fuels they sold were nearly identical, sellers could differentiate themselves only by lowering prices. The only way to survive on those rock-bottom prices was to sell more gas. These imperatives drew fuelers to high-traffic intersections, where they broadcasted their prices from huge billboards. Today, America’s 120,000 gas stations are one of the most transparent, hyper-competitive markets in America.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fa/59/7a977f2f40eaa4d75bc83bedc14e/ev-photogrid-v2.jpg\"> <br> <p>Unlike gasoline, electricity was not a street-corner hustle. People wanted it everywhere. Competing for business didn’t make sense because the wiring was so expensive. The grid wasn’t a business, really, but an essential public service — a utility. A social compact emerged where the electric utility would bear the cost of building and maintaining the grid, and in exchange would enjoy a territorial monopoly. To prevent abuse, each state created a public utility commission to oversee the utility’s complicated pricing schedules. The electric company became one of the most complex, obscure and uncompetitive markets in America. </p> <p>And then came the electric vehicle.</p> <p>It short-circuited what had been a symbiotic relationship. After all, gas stations and power companies are each other’s customers. The station illuminates its sign with electricity, and the utility fills its repair trucks with gasoline. Financially, the two are now nearly at parity: The convenience-store industry made $428 billion last year selling fuel, while corporate utilities earned $424 billion selling electricity. But the electric vehicle will inexorably tilt the playing field in the utility’s favor. That’s because with the onset of the EV, the dominant fuel will become electricity — and the utility controls it all.</p> <p>The utility monopoly is so basic to modern life that it goes unnoticed. But it explains why there’s never a usage fee for plugging in your laptop at the coffee shop, or for running the hotel hairdryer until your hairdo is crisp. Charging for electricity is illegal unless you’re the electric company.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2b/39/c8548060429bbbda79a181b7fa9e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.electrichx.jpg\"> <br> <p>As electric vehicles started taking hold, it occurred to many entrepreneurs that fueling them could be a moneymaker. But they faced an odd financial barrier. The fueler pays the utility for the electricity, but can’t ask the driver to share the cost. So, companies found workarounds. Some providers charged for the time spent plugged in. Others assessed a session fee. (Until two years ago, Tesla Inc., the EV market leader, let many of its drivers refuel at its Supercharger stations for free.) No strategy reflected the actual cost, but they were a start. Business needed a change to the law — an exemption that would, for the first time, allow someone other than a power company to sell electricity.</p> <p>Delia Meier, a senior vice president at Iowa 80, a chain of truck stops, took a leading position in Iowa to open the market to ‘charge for charging,’ as it’s sometimes called. “There’s a lot of red tape, a lot of things that probably don’t make any sense,” she said. The Iowa Utilities Board rarely met and moved slow. Meier’s regional utility, Alliant Energy, would request additional hearings, and submit objections at the last minute. To Meier, it seemed the utility was conducting a passive, faceless resistance, using its unmatched savvy before the utility board to wear down any who would challenge its monopoly status.</p> <p>“The whole time it seemed like people were agreeing with us,” Meier said. “Then (the board) would have a hearing and decide not to do anything about it. It went on and on and on.”</p> <p>In a statement to POLITICO’s E&amp;E News, Alliant said, “We are excited to be on the leading edge of electrification efforts and work hard to understand and meet our customers’ needs.”<br></p> <br> <p>In 2019, after a three-year process, Iowa relaxed its rules so stations like Iowa 80 can charge its customers any price for electric fuel, just like gasoline. Most states have done the same. The main lobbyists who forced the issue weren’t gas stations, but new companies whose bread and butter were charging stations — EVgo Inc., ChargePoint Holdings Inc. and, of course, Tesla. Alongside them were environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that a transition to electric vehicles — necessary to head off the climate crisis — couldn’t happen without a financial incentive to sell electric fuel to drivers. Today, only seven states still regulate EV charging as the exclusive domain of the electric company.</p> <p>But even with the freedom to charge customers what they want, gas station owners still think that the utility has stacked the deck against them.</p> <p>One reason is that some utilities also own and operate charging stations. They do so with their ratepayers’ money, in plans approved by regulators. Generally, this happens sparingly and in areas shunned by private industry. But convenience store owners fear the utility as a competitor because the utility has a state-allotted profit built into each of its investments. They worry this padding could lead the utility to set a new floor for fuel prices that the gas station can’t match.</p> <p>Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, explained it this way to Georgia lawmakers last year. Her 6,500 members “have to use the electricity from only one utility. If that same electricity provider is allowed to provide electric fueling stations …<b> </b>taking zero capital risk like the private sector will, they will create and maintain a monopoly in this market.”</p> <p>Gas station owners say their resistance to the electric company is not an effort to slow the transition away from their marquee product. “We have no more commitment to fossil fuels than we do to Snickers bars,” said Brian Young, the owner of a chain of gas stations in eastern Alabama. Rather, it’s that the prospect of installing a charging station is intimidatingly expensive.</p> <p>Convenience stores make tiny profits on gasoline and diesel. “Whether we sell at one dollar or four dollars,” Young said, “we still make 14 cents.” In this low-margin world, a fast charger is a monster investment. The hardware can cost $150,000 or more, according to a 2019 study by think tank RMI. It is a bracing risk, especially since no one knows exactly where future EV drivers will want to fuel. </p> <p>“Honestly, I’m dreading it, but maybe there’s a silver lining,” said Bob Bajwa, the owner of a gas station in Ritzville, Wash., on the prospect of transitioning to EVs. He’s being somewhat optimistic given his personal experience. Bajwa already has one charging station — installed on his property in 2015 by charging provider EVgo — that gets only the occasional customer and produces almost no revenue.</p> <p>The convenience stores know they are overmatched. It’s hard to imagine a future without an electric grid, but one without gas stations can be pretty easily conjured. The fuelers can’t unseat the utility as the kingpin. But a crucial question remains: What will the fuel cost?<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">O</span>ut of sight, utilities and EV station hosts are locked in a furious pricing battle. It threatens to create an uneven charging network where stations are eagerly built in some areas and shunned in others.</p> <p>It comes down to an obscure set of maps. They demarcate the lines between utility service territories. Kum &amp; Go’s decision to put its charging station in Wellington was not an accident. It has a lot to do with the fact that Wellington sits in the territory of Xcel Energy Inc., the state’s largest utility. The consequences would be different if the station was built five blocks to the north, where the territory of a different utility, Poudre Valley REA, begins. The same is true six miles to the south, where power service transfers to yet another provider, the city of Fort Collins.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/a0/74213ce64fde93a5cb98eed8bdf9/mag.Ferris.EVStation.wellington.jpg\"> <br> <p>One reason Kum &amp; Go chose to put its station in Xcel’s territory, and not in Fort Collins or Poudre Valley, is the electricity bill. In particular, it comes down to one line item, a fee that homeowners know nothing about, but some businesses know only too well.</p> <p>It’s called a demand charge. It is a base fee that gets multiplied. The multiplier is the kilowatt, the basic measurement of electrons. The fee is assessed on the few minutes of the monthly billing cycle when the customer is using the most kilowatts. Power companies have always charged this kind of fee as a means to recover the substantial cost of providing service to the customers who need a lot of electrical infrastructure. But the rationale goes haywire when applied to electric vehicles.</p> <p>That’s because an electric vehicle fast charger sucks energy like a black hole.</p> <p>“The draw is incredible,” said Meier of the Iowa 80 truck stop. She installed a couple of fast chargers last year. This type, technically known as a direct-current fast charger, is the natural choice for fueling-on-the-go because it fills a battery in anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the charger and the car model, compared to the slower systems that EV owners put in the home garage that can take all night. If two electric cars arrive and plug in at the same time, the electricity flow becomes a flood. The two fast chargers at Meier’s truck stop can use as much juice in their peak moments<b> </b>as the center’s six restaurants, 56,000 square-foot store, gas pumps and back offices combined.</p> <p>This sudden slurp of electricity can vault a gas station from the power stature of, say, a warehouse into the tier of heavy-duty power users such as an aluminum factory or a large farm with lots of irrigation pumps. But there’s a crucial difference: The factory or farm can plan its electricity use to avoid the sting of high demand charges. The host of a charging station cannot. At some moment beyond the gas station’s control, a flock of EVs will descend simultaneously, and the bill goes stratospheric.</p> <p>Those demand charges become an enormous burden. Electrify America, a leading charging provider, says that demand charges are up to 80 percent of the cost of operating a charging station.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/79/137161aa4918a829b67e1892a12a/mag.Ferris.EVStation.installgrid.jpg\"> <br> <p>A look at these power companies’ rates reveals why Kum &amp; Go was motivated to put its EV chargers in Wellington. If four electric vehicles plug into Kum &amp; Go’s four chargers at the same moment, they require the utility to summon 250 kilowatts. In Wellington, in the realm of power company Xcel, that kilowattage yields a monthly demand charge of $750. If the station moved south to Fort Collins, the charge rises to $2,672. If Kum &amp; Go plugged in to the north, in Poudre Valley, it would rise to $4,750. That’s six times the cost in Wellington.</p> <p>Finding utility territories with lower demand charges has become “a checkpoint for us before we approve a site,” said Maass. As for the territories with higher demand charges, he said: “We’re trying to avoid it the best we can.”</p> <p>Heading north on I-25, a Denver driver glides across five utility territories without even noticing. But for the gas-station operator, they are a hazardous game of hopscotch. These random power fiefs are not just a Denver thing, either: Each of the country’s 3,000 electric utilities has its own demand-charge regime, none having a logical relationship to their neighbors.</p> <p>“Literally they can put it on the other side of the freeway and it will be much cheaper,” said John Phelan, an energy services manager of Fort Collins’ utility.</p> <p>Profit isn’t yet an option. With expensive equipment and few users, the convenience store’s best outcome is to break even. “We’re trying to cover the cost of the electricity bill,” said Meier of Iowa 80, “and I think that’s all that anyone can expect at this point.”</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go knows the pain of this math. Ken Kleemeier, its vice president of fuels, gives the example of a 150-kilowatt charging session with a $6 demand charge. Six dollars times 150 kilowatts means the electricity bill is $900. But “we charge the customer $10,” Kleemeier said.<b> </b>“That’s a $900 loss. That’s where the demand charges are painful. There’s no feasible way to pass that along.”</p> <p>The utilities believe the demand-charge burden is temporary. As electric vehicles become more common, a charging station’s “utilization rate” — the number of hours per day the station is in use — will increase. The demand charge will be absorbed by more and more users, and eventually turn the charging station from money pit into profit center.</p> <p>Furthermore, utilities are starting to offer “demand charge holidays.” These are a period of years where the utility voids or lowers the fee to ease the transition. Gas stations are skeptical. “When the holiday expires, you’re back to demand charges and you’re left with an investment you can’t make money off of,” said David Fialkov, head of government affairs at NATSO, a trade group for truck-stop operators.</p> <p>This multi-headed conflict has created lots of reasons for gas stations and utilities to confront each other. But no conflict has been as vicious as what happened in Washington, D.C., when billions of dollars were on the line.<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span>n the spring of 2021, as Congress was laying the foundations for President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, lobbyists for both utilities and convenience stores were working overtime, framing issues this way and not that, nudging lawmakers down policy paths that could become etched in law.</p> <p>Utilities wanted at least part of the billions of dollars that Congress was mulling for EV infrastructure to go toward their strong suit: installing new power lines and equipment to feed charging stations. They argued they were a crucial link to the EV future. The gas station lobby wanted money, too, to offset the expense of building charging stations. But even more than money, they wanted leverage. They saw an opportunity to have Congress put them, not utilities, at the center of EV fueling.</p> <p>And despite their relatively small size as a lobbying force, the gas stations were scoring some wins.</p> <p>“Our advocacy on all of those fronts, I think, began to get more attention,” said Doug Kantor. At the time, Kantor was a partner at the firm Steptoe, a leading law and lobbying firm with 300 lawyers in its Washington office. For years, Kantor had led a team at Steptoe that lobbied on behalf of several trade groups that represent gas stations and convenience stores.</p> <p>In May, an ally of Kantor’s secured a spot to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A.J. Siccardi, the president of Metroplex Energy, the parent company of RaceTrac, one of the country’s biggest fueling chains, laid out a detailed agenda that would, at every turn, benefit gas stations at the expense of utilities.</p> <p>Demand charges? Abolish them, Siccardi argued, and instead make electricity available at wholesale prices, like gasoline. Subsidies for charging stations? Bar utilities from getting them if they also tapped their ratepayers’ money. A “double dip,” he called it. He also called on Congress to force all states to make gas stations legal sellers of electricity.</p> <p>Despite its financial heft, no one from the utility industry was on the panel to refute him.</p> <p>But they quickly got wind of the proposals. Louis Finkel, the head of government relations at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said he was galled by the gas station lobby’s request to abolish demand charges, a pillar of how the utilities pay for expensive projects. “If someone said they have to rip out and move their fuel tanks a half a mile,” Finkel asked, “who would have to pay for it?”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/7b/9e/367284eb43059d6268193741216e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.pizarro.jpg\"> <br> <p>In June, Kantor and the gas station lobby scored another win. A group of 17 legislators sent a letter to the committee heads responsible for the EV-charging portions of the bill.

One person was particularly put out: Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the state’s biggest utilities. Correa, the letter’s author, said he received a heated call from Pizarro. “I think he didn’t like the tone of the letter,” Correa said in an interview, adding that he said he apologized to Pizarro.</p> <p>In a statement to POLITICO’s E&amp;E News, Southern California Edison said, “the company reached out to numerous lawmakers on provisions of the infrastructure bill,” adding that Pizarro “spoke with Congressman Correa on the important role that electric utilities, with the support and approval of state regulatory commissions, must play in ensuring the deployment of EV charging infrastructure.”</p> <p>But Edison didn’t stop there.</p> <p>In May, Kantor said, some of his partners at Steptoe reached out with uncomfortable news. It involved a request from Edison and other utility clients of Steptoe who weren’t named. Kantor said he was told that Edison had informed Steptoe that if it didn’t sever its relationship with the fueling industry, the electric utility would take its business elsewhere. Kantor described the utility’s thinking as: “Hey, strategically it would be a good thing if we sidelined Steptoe, so they couldn’t continue this advocacy,” he said. “And that was exactly what they did.” Edison declined to comment on Kantor’s story, calling it “an internal matter that is best addressed by Steptoe &amp; Johnson,” the firm’s former name.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/42/614bc9d64fd1b0ead723a74ee903/mag.Ferris.EVStation.traffic.jpg\"> <br> <p>No one forced Kantor to leave, but he thought it was the best thing. (“I did not think as an adviser to my clients that I should tell them they should continue to use me when one of the most important issues to the future of the industry was something that I couldn’t work on,” he said.)</p> <p>Those shoved out of Steptoe by the utilities now hold key positions in the gas-station industry. Kantor took a new job as general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a leading gas station trade group, while two people who left with him, Jessica Frend and LeeAnn Goheen, are in top policy jobs at NATSO.

The Biden administration knows drivers won’t buy EVs without the confidence that they can charge up on road trips. As a result, the very first EV spending from the bipartisan infrastructure bill — $1 billion — is dedicated to building charging stations every 50 miles on high-use corridors.

Its stored energy could be poured into cars at peak charging times and give the fueler a measure of independence from the utility, perhaps even allowing it to wring a small profit like it does with gas. Others foresee a slog of negotiations, utility by utility. Pilot, a truck-stop operator that wants to offer chargers at 500 locations, will ask power companies to standardize their rates in order to make the financials of charging more coherent. “We have some time to spend with the utilities, and a hill to climb,” said Shameek Konar, Pilot’s CEO.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/5e/0e/8f6979f44f75913bac9848ce03a9/mag.Ferris.EVStation.ender.jpg\"> <br> <p>And gas stations haven’t given up on fighting utilities just because they lost out on the infrastructure bill. Early this year, the gas station lobby formed a new trade group called the Charge Ahead Partnership, made up mostly of gas-pump owners but aspiring to widen its utility pressure campaign to other charging-curious retailers, like grocers and shopping malls. “Public utilities currently have an unfair advantage over this new marketplace,” the group said in a statement last month.</p> <p>As they trade blows over who controls the electricity and how much it costs, both utilities and convenience stores are mindful that tomorrow’s charging network will be shaped by the preferences of people like Jennifer Sirani.</p> <p>In June, Sirani ran into trouble in Wyoming.

There she got a tow truck that pulled her 20 miles to a charging station down the line.</p> <p>The following day, as she refilled yet again at Kum &amp; Go’s charging station in Wellington, she cast an eye at the gas pumps and the little convenience mart.

But it is.\n One clue is in plain sight as you look around during the boring few minutes it takes to top off your tank. Plopped in the corner of the lot like an afterthought are four vertical red slabs.\n They’re electric vehicle charging stations, capable of reviving an EV and its battery in about half an hour. It is no exaggeration to say they could be the most disruptive thing ever to confront that century-old fixture of the American roadside: the gas station. As more Americans drive their shiny new electric vehicles onto the highway and wonder where to go when the battery nears empty, charging stations are the agents of a revolutionary fill-up — not of gallons but kilowatts, not five-minute “stops” but half-hour “experiences” that could completely transform the tenor of the road trip.\n These pumps and plugs facing each other across the asphalt are also totems of an unseen battle. Two titans of the energy sector — electric companies and gas stations — have peacefully coexisted for a century but now find themselves vying for the right to serve electric vehicle owners. In just the last nine months, automakers have sold over 576,000 EVs, a 70-percent jump over the same period last year, according to auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. A burst of investment in both vehicles and chargers from automakers and the feds suggest that’s just the beginning. Ford and General Motors, America’s two biggest automakers, and the Biden administration have coalesced around a goal of electrifying half of new cars by 2030.\n Crucial to that future is a nationwide network of charging stations. Who controls those stations and the fuel coursing through them is the flash point of a fight between the electric utility and the convenience store. The outcome will impact where Americans charge their EVs and how much they pay.\n As both gas stations and power companies hang their future on the electric vehicle, the fight has gotten ugly. In fact, heads have already rolled. One electric utility, Southern California Edison, forced the resignation of a key lobbyist in order to kneecap the gas station industry as Congress considered President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging stations. The spigot of federal dollars only increased with the passage in August of the big federal climate-energy bill, stuffed with incentives to restructure the auto industry around EVs.\n \n  \n This collision between electricity and gasoline is in sharp relief at Kum & Go, a chain of almost 400 filling stations and convenience marts in 11 states that has invited the electric vehicle to disrupt its business model. Wellington is the final settlement of metro Denver before the plains spread north toward Wyoming. Alongside the grind of I-25, next to a McDonald's, stands the Kum & Go with its sign advertising the latest price for unleaded. It’s one of six Kum & Go stations in the state that have embraced electric vehicle charging. Other gas station chains sometimes host charging stations owned by someone else, often Tesla. But Kum & Go has branded these stations in its red-and-white color scheme.\n In 2018, Kum & Go set the goal of “being known as the place that has EV charging,” said Jacob Maass, the company’s commercial fuel manager. This year, as electric vehicles have begun to seem inevitable and the Biden administration spends big to construct a network of 500,000 fast-charging stations, some of the country’s biggest fueling chains have joined the parade, including Pilot Co. and 7-Eleven.\n But success hinges on resolving fundamental disputes over who has the right to sell electricity, and for how much.\n The supply chain that underpins the gas station — starting in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia or Texas and flowing through intermediaries to that big price on the sign — becomes something else entirely in the EV age. What replaces it is a system of stupefying complexity. The price a station host pays for the new fuel is determined by which of America’s 3,000 electric utilities the plugs happen to be connected to. This pricing system is invisible to the driver but presents an existential dilemma for gas station owners. They find themselves at the mercy of an opaque, highly regulated and monopolistic electricity system that is the exact opposite of the one they have thrived on for decades. \n EV charging involves “an electricity market structure that was not designed for — and is, not surprisingly, incompatible with — the retail fuel market,” said A.J. Siccardi, a fueling executive, in testimony to Congress last summer that caused sparks between the two camps.\n It is possible that gas stations and electric companies will sort through their thicket of disagreements so that gas stations can make money filling batteries, while also (strangely enough) becoming a cool place to hang out. Or it’s possible that the fueling station as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by battery refills in home garages, at workplace parking lots or at Starbucks, while the driver nurses a venti latte.\n In other words, these electric cubes on the Colorado roadside are either the dominoes that trigger the gas station’s revolution, or the headstones that mark its grave.\n \n \nAmerica’s 20th-century economic growth was powered by the electric grid and the gas station. But as businesses, they couldn’t be more different.\n The gas station arrived in the early 1900s, soon after the car itself, and quickly became a cutthroat game. Because the fuels they sold were nearly identical, sellers could differentiate themselves only by lowering prices. The only way to survive on those rock-bottom prices was to sell more gas. These imperatives drew fuelers to high-traffic intersections, where they broadcasted their prices from huge billboards. Today, America’s 120,000 gas stations are one of the most transparent, hyper-competitive markets in America.\n \n  \n Unlike gasoline, electricity was not a street-corner hustle. People wanted it everywhere. Competing for business didn’t make sense because the wiring was so expensive. The grid wasn’t a business, really, but an essential public service — a utility. A social compact emerged where the electric utility would bear the cost of building and maintaining the grid, and in exchange would enjoy a territorial monopoly. To prevent abuse, each state created a public utility commission to oversee the utility’s complicated pricing schedules. The electric company became one of the most complex, obscure and uncompetitive markets in America. \n And then came the electric vehicle.\n It short-circuited what had been a symbiotic relationship. After all, gas stations and power companies are each other’s customers. The station illuminates its sign with electricity, and the utility fills its repair trucks with gasoline. Financially, the two are now nearly at parity: The convenience-store industry made $428 billion last year selling fuel, while corporate utilities earned $424 billion selling electricity. But the electric vehicle will inexorably tilt the playing field in the utility’s favor. That’s because with the onset of the EV, the dominant fuel will become electricity — and the utility controls it all.\n The utility monopoly is so basic to modern life that it goes unnoticed. But it explains why there’s never a usage fee for plugging in your laptop at the coffee shop, or for running the hotel hairdryer until your hairdo is crisp. Charging for electricity is illegal unless you’re the electric company.\n \n  \n As electric vehicles started taking hold, it occurred to many entrepreneurs that fueling them could be a moneymaker. But they faced an odd financial barrier. The fueler pays the utility for the electricity, but can’t ask the driver to share the cost. So, companies found workarounds. Some providers charged for the time spent plugged in. Others assessed a session fee. (Until two years ago, Tesla Inc., the EV market leader, let many of its drivers refuel at its Supercharger stations for free.) No strategy reflected the actual cost, but they were a start. Business needed a change to the law — an exemption that would, for the first time, allow someone other than a power company to sell electricity.\n Delia Meier, a senior vice president at Iowa 80, a chain of truck stops, took a leading position in Iowa to open the market to ‘charge for charging,’ as it’s sometimes called. “There’s a lot of red tape, a lot of things that probably don’t make any sense,” she said. The Iowa Utilities Board rarely met and moved slow. Meier’s regional utility, Alliant Energy, would request additional hearings, and submit objections at the last minute. To Meier, it seemed the utility was conducting a passive, faceless resistance, using its unmatched savvy before the utility board to wear down any who would challenge its monopoly status.\n “The whole time it seemed like people were agreeing with us,” Meier said. “Then (the board) would have a hearing and decide not to do anything about it. It went on and on and on.”\n In a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News, Alliant said, “We are excited to be on the leading edge of electrification efforts and work hard to understand and meet our customers’ needs.”\n \n In 2019, after a three-year process, Iowa relaxed its rules so stations like Iowa 80 can charge its customers any price for electric fuel, just like gasoline. Most states have done the same. The main lobbyists who forced the issue weren’t gas stations, but new companies whose bread and butter were charging stations — EVgo Inc., ChargePoint Holdings Inc. and, of course, Tesla. Alongside them were environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that a transition to electric vehicles — necessary to head off the climate crisis — couldn’t happen without a financial incentive to sell electric fuel to drivers. Today, only seven states still regulate EV charging as the exclusive domain of the electric company.\n But even with the freedom to charge customers what they want, gas station owners still think that the utility has stacked the deck against them.\n One reason is that some utilities also own and operate charging stations. They do so with their ratepayers’ money, in plans approved by regulators. Generally, this happens sparingly and in areas shunned by private industry. But convenience store owners fear the utility as a competitor because the utility has a state-allotted profit built into each of its investments. They worry this padding could lead the utility to set a new floor for fuel prices that the gas station can’t match.\n Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, explained it this way to Georgia lawmakers last year. Her 6,500 members “have to use the electricity from only one utility. If that same electricity provider is allowed to provide electric fueling stations … taking zero capital risk like the private sector will, they will create and maintain a monopoly in this market.”\n Gas station owners say their resistance to the electric company is not an effort to slow the transition away from their marquee product. “We have no more commitment to fossil fuels than we do to Snickers bars,” said Brian Young, the owner of a chain of gas stations in eastern Alabama. Rather, it’s that the prospect of installing a charging station is intimidatingly expensive.\n Convenience stores make tiny profits on gasoline and diesel. “Whether we sell at one dollar or four dollars,” Young said, “we still make 14 cents.” In this low-margin world, a fast charger is a monster investment. The hardware can cost $150,000 or more, according to a 2019 study by think tank RMI. It is a bracing risk, especially since no one knows exactly where future EV drivers will want to fuel. \n “Honestly, I’m dreading it, but maybe there’s a silver lining,” said Bob Bajwa, the owner of a gas station in Ritzville, Wash., on the prospect of transitioning to EVs. He’s being somewhat optimistic given his personal experience. Bajwa already has one charging station — installed on his property in 2015 by charging provider EVgo — that gets only the occasional customer and produces almost no revenue.\n The convenience stores know they are overmatched. It’s hard to imagine a future without an electric grid, but one without gas stations can be pretty easily conjured. The fuelers can’t unseat the utility as the kingpin. But a crucial question remains: What will the fuel cost?\n \n \nOut of sight, utilities and EV station hosts are locked in a furious pricing battle. It threatens to create an uneven charging network where stations are eagerly built in some areas and shunned in others.\n It comes down to an obscure set of maps. They demarcate the lines between utility service territories. Kum & Go’s decision to put its charging station in Wellington was not an accident. It has a lot to do with the fact that Wellington sits in the territory of Xcel Energy Inc., the state’s largest utility. The consequences would be different if the station was built five blocks to the north, where the territory of a different utility, Poudre Valley REA, begins. The same is true six miles to the south, where power service transfers to yet another provider, the city of Fort Collins.\n \n  \n One reason Kum & Go chose to put its station in Xcel’s territory, and not in Fort Collins or Poudre Valley, is the electricity bill. In particular, it comes down to one line item, a fee that homeowners know nothing about, but some businesses know only too well.\n It’s called a demand charge. It is a base fee that gets multiplied. The multiplier is the kilowatt, the basic measurement of electrons. The fee is assessed on the few minutes of the monthly billing cycle when the customer is using the most kilowatts. Power companies have always charged this kind of fee as a means to recover the substantial cost of providing service to the customers who need a lot of electrical infrastructure. But the rationale goes haywire when applied to electric vehicles.\n That’s because an electric vehicle fast charger sucks energy like a black hole.\n “The draw is incredible,” said Meier of the Iowa 80 truck stop. She installed a couple of fast chargers last year. This type, technically known as a direct-current fast charger, is the natural choice for fueling-on-the-go because it fills a battery in anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the charger and the car model, compared to the slower systems that EV owners put in the home garage that can take all night. If two electric cars arrive and plug in at the same time, the electricity flow becomes a flood. The two fast chargers at Meier’s truck stop can use as much juice in their peak moments as the center’s six restaurants, 56,000 square-foot store, gas pumps and back offices combined.\n This sudden slurp of electricity can vault a gas station from the power stature of, say, a warehouse into the tier of heavy-duty power users such as an aluminum factory or a large farm with lots of irrigation pumps. But there’s a crucial difference: The factory or farm can plan its electricity use to avoid the sting of high demand charges. The host of a charging station cannot. At some moment beyond the gas station’s control, a flock of EVs will descend simultaneously, and the bill goes stratospheric.\n Those demand charges become an enormous burden. Electrify America, a leading charging provider, says that demand charges are up to 80 percent of the cost of operating a charging station.\n \n  \n A look at these power companies’ rates reveals why Kum & Go was motivated to put its EV chargers in Wellington. If four electric vehicles plug into Kum & Go’s four chargers at the same moment, they require the utility to summon 250 kilowatts. In Wellington, in the realm of power company Xcel, that kilowattage yields a monthly demand charge of $750. If the station moved south to Fort Collins, the charge rises to $2,672. If Kum & Go plugged in to the north, in Poudre Valley, it would rise to $4,750. That’s six times the cost in Wellington.\n Finding utility territories with lower demand charges has become “a checkpoint for us before we approve a site,” said Maass. As for the territories with higher demand charges, he said: “We’re trying to avoid it the best we can.”\n Heading north on I-25, a Denver driver glides across five utility territories without even noticing. But for the gas-station operator, they are a hazardous game of hopscotch. These random power fiefs are not just a Denver thing, either: Each of the country’s 3,000 electric utilities has its own demand-charge regime, none having a logical relationship to their neighbors.\n “Literally they can put it on the other side of the freeway and it will be much cheaper,” said John Phelan, an energy services manager of Fort Collins’ utility.\n Profit isn’t yet an option. With expensive equipment and few users, the convenience store’s best outcome is to break even. “We’re trying to cover the cost of the electricity bill,” said Meier of Iowa 80, “and I think that’s all that anyone can expect at this point.”\n Kum & Go knows the pain of this math. Ken Kleemeier, its vice president of fuels, gives the example of a 150-kilowatt charging session with a $6 demand charge. Six dollars times 150 kilowatts means the electricity bill is $900. But “we charge the customer $10,” Kleemeier said. “That’s a $900 loss. That’s where the demand charges are painful. There’s no feasible way to pass that along.”\n The utilities believe the demand-charge burden is temporary. As electric vehicles become more common, a charging station’s “utilization rate” — the number of hours per day the station is in use — will increase. The demand charge will be absorbed by more and more users, and eventually turn the charging station from money pit into profit center.\n Furthermore, utilities are starting to offer “demand charge holidays.” These are a period of years where the utility voids or lowers the fee to ease the transition. Gas stations are skeptical. “When the holiday expires, you’re back to demand charges and you’re left with an investment you can’t make money off of,” said David Fialkov, head of government affairs at NATSO, a trade group for truck-stop operators.\n This multi-headed conflict has created lots of reasons for gas stations and utilities to confront each other. But no conflict has been as vicious as what happened in Washington, D.C., when billions of dollars were on the line.\n \n \nIn the spring of 2021, as Congress was laying the foundations for President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, lobbyists for both utilities and convenience stores were working overtime, framing issues this way and not that, nudging lawmakers down policy paths that could become etched in law.\n Utilities wanted at least part of the billions of dollars that Congress was mulling for EV infrastructure to go toward their strong suit: installing new power lines and equipment to feed charging stations. They argued they were a crucial link to the EV future. The gas station lobby wanted money, too, to offset the expense of building charging stations. But even more than money, they wanted leverage. They saw an opportunity to have Congress put them, not utilities, at the center of EV fueling.\n And despite their relatively small size as a lobbying force, the gas stations were scoring some wins.\n “Our advocacy on all of those fronts, I think, began to get more attention,” said Doug Kantor. At the time, Kantor was a partner at the firm Steptoe, a leading law and lobbying firm with 300 lawyers in its Washington office. For years, Kantor had led a team at Steptoe that lobbied on behalf of several trade groups that represent gas stations and convenience stores.\n In May, an ally of Kantor’s secured a spot to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A.J. Siccardi, the president of Metroplex Energy, the parent company of RaceTrac, one of the country’s biggest fueling chains, laid out a detailed agenda that would, at every turn, benefit gas stations at the expense of utilities.\n Demand charges? Abolish them, Siccardi argued, and instead make electricity available at wholesale prices, like gasoline. Subsidies for charging stations? Bar utilities from getting them if they also tapped their ratepayers’ money. A “double dip,” he called it. He also called on Congress to force all states to make gas stations legal sellers of electricity.\n Despite its financial heft, no one from the utility industry was on the panel to refute him.\n But they quickly got wind of the proposals. Louis Finkel, the head of government relations at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said he was galled by the gas station lobby’s request to abolish demand charges, a pillar of how the utilities pay for expensive projects. “If someone said they have to rip out and move their fuel tanks a half a mile,” Finkel asked, “who would have to pay for it?”\n \n  \n In June, Kantor and the gas station lobby scored another win. A group of 17 legislators sent a letter to the committee heads responsible for the EV-charging portions of the bill. Led by Rep. Lou Correa, a Democrat from California’s Orange County, it echoed gas stations’ talking points. “Fuel retailers are best positioned to own and operate EV charging stations and provide transportation energy to consumers,” the letter said.\n The way the letter put gas stations at the center of electric fueling, while limiting the electric company’s role, made some in the utility industry furious. One person was particularly put out: Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the state’s biggest utilities. Correa, the letter’s author, said he received a heated call from Pizarro. “I think he didn’t like the tone of the letter,” Correa said in an interview, adding that he said he apologized to Pizarro.\n In a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News, Southern California Edison said, “the company reached out to numerous lawmakers on provisions of the infrastructure bill,” adding that Pizarro “spoke with Congressman Correa on the important role that electric utilities, with the support and approval of state regulatory commissions, must play in ensuring the deployment of EV charging infrastructure.”\n But Edison didn’t stop there.\n In May, Kantor said, some of his partners at Steptoe reached out with uncomfortable news. It involved a request from Edison and other utility clients of Steptoe who weren’t named. Kantor said he was told that Edison had informed Steptoe that if it didn’t sever its relationship with the fueling industry, the electric utility would take its business elsewhere. Kantor described the utility’s thinking as: “Hey, strategically it would be a good thing if we sidelined Steptoe, so they couldn’t continue this advocacy,” he said. “And that was exactly what they did.” Edison declined to comment on Kantor’s story, calling it “an internal matter that is best addressed by Steptoe & Johnson,” the firm’s former name.\n \n  \n No one forced Kantor to leave, but he thought it was the best thing. (“I did not think as an adviser to my clients that I should tell them they should continue to use me when one of the most important issues to the future of the industry was something that I couldn’t work on,” he said.)\n Those shoved out of Steptoe by the utilities now hold key positions in the gas-station industry. Kantor took a new job as general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a leading gas station trade group, while two people who left with him, Jessica Frend and LeeAnn Goheen, are in top policy jobs at NATSO. Steptoe declined to comment on the specifics of Kantor’s departure but said in a statement, “We continue to work with Doug in his role at NACS. We count him as a good personal friend as well as a former colleague.”\n In the end, despite its early tactical victories, the gas station lobby got little of what it wanted in the final infrastructure bill, which Biden signed in November. The bill did not overrule “charge for charging” regulations in individual states, nor block utilities from getting infrastructure funds. It asked state electricity regulators to consider the burden of demand charges, but that request has no teeth. By virtue of its incumbency and power, the utility industry had prevailed over the gas stations. It didn’t have to win; it just had to prevent change.\n “The c-stores and truck stops say sometimes that they’re uncomfortable” with the utilities’ regulated-monopoly model, said Phil Jones, a former utility regulator who heads a utility-heavy trade group, the Alliance for Transportation Electrification. “But we’ve told them that model is not going to change.”\n \n \nThe gas station of the future might not have a single pump or even a whiff of gasoline. That’s because it might not be a gas station, but a Walgreens.\n In February, the drugstore chain said it would install fast chargers at more than 500 locations. The hardware comes from Volta Inc., a station provider whose stations double as advertising kiosks, and that also owns the financial transaction between car and charger. In June, Volta signed up the grocer Kroger Co. at locations in Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. Chris Wendel, the co-founder of Volta, thinks electric vehicles shatter the gas station’s very premise.\n “People won’t go to get fuel,” he said. “You will get it from your home or working place, or in the context of the other things you are doing.”\n Those other things could be buying groceries or picking up prescriptions — activities that neatly fit the 20 to 40 minutes it takes to fill a battery. Wendel intends for the retailer to capture any purchases now done at the convenience store “that has wallets attached,” he said.\n Meanwhile, Kum & Go is betting on a totally different scenario — one that it hopes will preserve the stature of the filling station in the roadside landscape.\n Driving, for example, on Denver’s I-25, you see your battery is low and check an app for nearby charging prices. Kum & Go gets your business because its kilowatt-hour rate is two cents cheaper than the Loaf ’N Jug across the street.\n You pull in and plug into a hybrid charging plaza, alongside the gas pumps. The car says the refill will take 20 to 40 minutes. Hungry, you head toward the little mart that sits beside most every gas station in America. But that mart has transformed. It is no longer a sterile and slightly desperate place designed to satisfy your craving for candy or a lottery ticket, with a scary bathroom and the smell of old hot dogs. Instead, you find comfortable chairs. Tables. Wi-Fi. Under soft lighting, you explore the beer cave, or pick up a made-to-order sandwich on fresh-baked bread.\n Kum & Go has brought the food and comfort part of that experience to more than 100 locations already in nine states between Colorado and Michigan. The plan is to have many overlap with electric vehicle charging, Maass said.\n So it is possible that someday you will nip out to the gas station for a burrito bowl. Or maybe you won’t because the fueling station itself will have wandered off to Taco Bell, which just announced a new chain of charging stations in California. Or to Starbucks, which, as it happens, is creating a chain of its own between Seattle and Denver.\n \n  \n Beset as they are by new competitors, gas stations believe that drivers’ deep-seated habits give them an advantage, along with their perch at busy intersections. One type of station finds itself with particularly strong leverage: the highway stop in the middle of nowhere.\n Far from the Walgreens and Starbucks, an infusion of federal money is coming. The Biden administration knows drivers won’t buy EVs without the confidence that they can charge up on road trips. As a result, the very first EV spending from the bipartisan infrastructure bill — $1 billion — is dedicated to building charging stations every 50 miles on high-use corridors. These chargers must be no more than one mile from the highway — in other words, exactly where truck stops and highway gas stations are now.\n “The gravitational force of our position will require people to realize that without us, it won’t work,” said Fialkov of NATSO, the truck stop trade group.\n The millions of new electric vehicles that soon will arrive on America’s roads have gas stations hunting for new solutions.\n Kum & Go, for example, next year will try deploying a battery next to a charging station. Its stored energy could be poured into cars at peak charging times and give the fueler a measure of independence from the utility, perhaps even allowing it to wring a small profit like it does with gas. Others foresee a slog of negotiations, utility by utility. Pilot, a truck-stop operator that wants to offer chargers at 500 locations, will ask power companies to standardize their rates in order to make the financials of charging more coherent. “We have some time to spend with the utilities, and a hill to climb,” said Shameek Konar, Pilot’s CEO.\n \n  \n And gas stations haven’t given up on fighting utilities just because they lost out on the infrastructure bill. Early this year, the gas station lobby formed a new trade group called the Charge Ahead Partnership, made up mostly of gas-pump owners but aspiring to widen its utility pressure campaign to other charging-curious retailers, like grocers and shopping malls. “Public utilities currently have an unfair advantage over this new marketplace,” the group said in a statement last month.\n As they trade blows over who controls the electricity and how much it costs, both utilities and convenience stores are mindful that tomorrow’s charging network will be shaped by the preferences of people like Jennifer Sirani.\n In June, Sirani ran into trouble in Wyoming. She was braving a trip from Idaho to Nebraska for her sister’s wedding in her new electric Kia Niro. Between Rock Springs and Laramie, a 200-mile charging desert, Sirani realized her battery was dying. Salvation took the form of truck stop. There she got a tow truck that pulled her 20 miles to a charging station down the line.\n The following day, as she refilled yet again at Kum & Go’s charging station in Wellington, she cast an eye at the gas pumps and the little convenience mart. One day that shop could satisfy her long wait with a healthy protein bowl, but today it’s just potato chips and Gatorade.\n “Here is OK,” she concluded. “At the Walmart, there’s a little more to do.”","dc:creator":"David Ferris","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/png","url":"https://static.politico.com/73/94/0351d8fc4f6eb6decfacfd348412/header-still.png"},"media:title":[{"_":"Illustrations by Rebekka Dunlap for POLITICO","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/73/94/0351d8fc4f6eb6decfacfd348412/header-still.png"}}]},"content":"Electric vehicles are changing the way Americans fuel up.

You don’t have to endorse any of the specific proposals talked about by these very different people to be disturbed by the campus-like fervor with which they have been deemed unsayable and unthinkable.</p> <p>Although it’s possible that the Russia war machine, if it can be called that, simply collapses in Ukraine, it is more likely that war will end in some messy compromise involving a negotiated settlement. Acknowledging this — and that the continuation of the conflict is a humanitarian catastrophe with enormous costs for the West and the world — shouldn’t be a quasi-thought crime.</p> <p>The Jayapal letter’s call for “direct talks with Russia” as Ukraine makes battlefield gains and Russia has responded with attacks on civilian infrastructure was obviously inopportune, and this wouldn’t be the first move regardless — we’d want to get Volodymyr Zelenskyy on board with any diplomatic proposal as a first order of business.</p> <p>Yet the letter was hardly an apology for Vladimir Putin.

Indeed, it’s their go-to proposal for solving any international problem, no matter how intractable or threatening. That it has now become a toxic notion in the context of the Ukraine war is a sign of how a justified feeling of moral righteousness among backers of Ukraine is swallowing rational thought about how the war might end.\n The letter to President Joe Biden from 30 House progressives led by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, engendered the same intensely negative reaction as public musings about diplomatic deals by Elon Musk and Henry Kissinger. You don’t have to endorse any of the specific proposals talked about by these very different people to be disturbed by the campus-like fervor with which they have been deemed unsayable and unthinkable.\n Although it’s possible that the Russia war machine, if it can be called that, simply collapses in Ukraine, it is more likely that war will end in some messy compromise involving a negotiated settlement. Acknowledging this — and that the continuation of the conflict is a humanitarian catastrophe with enormous costs for the West and the world — shouldn’t be a quasi-thought crime.\n The Jayapal letter’s call for “direct talks with Russia” as Ukraine makes battlefield gains and Russia has responded with attacks on civilian infrastructure was obviously inopportune, and this wouldn’t be the first move regardless — we’d want to get Volodymyr Zelenskyy on board with any diplomatic proposal as a first order of business.\n Yet the letter was hardly an apology for Vladimir Putin. It refers to “Russia’s war of aggression” and the “outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine,” while at the same time hailing Biden’s support for Ukraine’s “self-defense” as an “independent, sovereign and democratic state.” It expressed its support for a deal “preserving a free and independent Ukraine,” and stipulated that there should be security guarantees for Ukraine acceptable to all parties, “particularly Ukrainians.”\n Still, a member of the House Democratic leadership told POLITICO Playbook that “Vladimir Putin would have signed that letter if asked.” This isn’t remotely true, but it shows how departing an inch from the orthodoxy on the war is automatically taken as an admission of fondness for the Kremlin, even when Democrats are talking about other Democrats.

Ron DeSantis said Saturday night that his state can be a model of what New York could be if Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin is elected governor.\n DeSantis, widely considered a 2024 presidential contender, hyped up a rally on Zeldin’s native Long Island where the state’s top Republicans urged the crowd to take advantage of early voting that started Saturday and as a grinning Andrew Giuliani could be seen tossing T-shirts and footballs into the crowd in between speakers.\n Electing a Republican New York governor on Nov. 8 — which hasn’t been done since 2002 — “will be the 21st century version of the shot heard round the world,” DeSantis said.\n DeSantis earned cheers touting his own record of avoiding Covid-19 vaccine mandates, criticizing state education policies teaching about systemic racism and cracking down on the protests in the wake of George Floyd death in 2020 by using National Guard forces. He said that Zeldin’s leadership — particularly in criminal justice areas — would stop the outmigration to his own state.\n “I would say the number one thing I hear, where people get so fed up, is they are sick and tired of the crime that you see, particularly in New York City,” he added. “Florida is a law-and-order state. I am a law-and-order governor. If Lee Zeldin gets into office, New York will become a law-and-order state.”\n DeSantis is no friend to New York’s leaders — he and Gov. Kathy Hochul traded barbs about her comments that some Republicans in the state should take a bus to Florida — and his part in sending migrants as political statements to large cities is causing grief for elected officials in New York.\n “I'd like to see him get in there and unleash your own energy here in the state of New York,” DeSantis said about Zeldin. “So I think this is an important choice for the state of New York. Do you want to continue down the path that you're on — the path that’s seen you hemorrhage people, wealth, you name it. Or you want to try a different direction?”\n Florida surpassed New York as the nation's third largest state in 2014.\n Zeldin’s campaign has gained momentum in recent weeks with promises to aggressively crack down on crime, boosted by millions of dollars from outside groups.\n In response, Hochul’s campaign has pivoted to emphasize her work on crime and economic issues. State and national Democrats have frantically rallied to bolster the Hochul campaign’s presence in vulnerable areas, including New York City. Former President Barack Obama backed “his friend” Hochul in a Friday radio ad encouraging New Yorkers to vote.\n Zeldin, to the cheering audience on Saturday, feigned concern that national celebrities have begun to weigh in attacks against him, citing actor Mark Ruffalo’s Twitter response to Zeldin’s promise to reverse the state’s ban on fracking if elected.\n “Leonardo DiCaprio retweeted it,\" he said. \"I was crushed.

Vance has touted his business credentials as a venture capitalist and job creator for the state of Ohio.\n “My business in Ohio has been involved in investing and supporting the creation of nearly 1,000 jobs just in our state and jobs elsewhere as well,” he said in a recent debate with his opponent, Democrat Tim Ryan. “I believe in investing in our communities, and I’ve actually put my money where my mouth is.”\n A POLITICO analysis of information provided by his venture capital firm and Vance’s financial disclosure forms suggest that 1,000 may be a bit of a stretch. Since it was founded in 2019, Narya, Vance’s venture capital firm, was part of a group of at least 46 investors who together invested in three companies that created a total of about 750 jobs in the state of Ohio between 2019 and 2022.\n “We’re proud to say that, in just over 2.5 years, Narya has already invested in three Ohio companies that have collectively created approximately 750 jobs,” Vance’s partner, Falon Donohue, said in a statement. “These companies are growing quickly so we anticipate even more hiring in the short term.”\n \n  \n Vance and Ryan are scheduled to appear at a Fox News town hall on Tuesday — their final meeting of the campaign. Ryan, who has tried to make Vance’s venture capital career an issue in the campaign, has called Vance a “San Francisco vulture capitalist.” In a recent ad, he highlights Vance’s personal investment in AcreTrader, which Ryan claims sells farmland to Chinese citizens.\n Vance’s business record, including his job creation estimate, is open to interpretation.\n Steve Stivers, the former Republican congressman and the president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, which is remaining neutral in this year’s Senate race, said the state’s rate of job creation has been as low as 1,000 jobs a month so the addition of 750 new jobs is meaningful.\n “The 750 jobs would be almost what the whole state gained in a month, which is pretty significant,” Stivers said.\n But Jeff Sohl, director of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire, noted that Narya was just one of 46 firms that contributed to the investments, so it can’t claim credit for directly creating all 750 jobs.\n “It would be impossible to parse out which investor is responsible for each job created,” Sohl said in an email. “If one assumes that each investor can take an equal share of the job creation (which is a reasonable assumption) then at best Narya can claim 750 jobs divided by 46 investors which equals 16 jobs.”\n Former AOL Chair and CEO Steve Case, who launched the Rise of the Rest venture fund where Vance worked, told POLITICO that Vance’s political pivot to support Trump “was a surprise and frankly, a disappointment,” but added that “backing more startups in more parts of the country, obviously, is what we're all about.”\n \n \n A partner at another Ohio-based venture capital fund, granted anonymity to speak freely about Vance’s business record, told POLITICO that “claiming responsibility for creating 1,000 jobs is definitely a reach. We measure job creation based on incremental jobs since our investment.”\n Vance is best known to the public as the author of the bestselling 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” which told the story of his hardscrabble childhood in Appalachia and how he used military service and an Ivy League education to eventually succeed in finance.\n Since 2016, Vance has worked for three venture capital firms. First, he was with Mithril, the firm headed by his political benefactor and mentor, Peter Thiel. Next, he spent a year at Rise of the Rest, the fund launched by Case, which focuses on investing in heartland enterprises.\n In 2019, Vance moved back to Ohio and founded his own venture capital firm with a Connecticut-based co-founder, naming it Narya after one of the author J.R.R Tolkien’s so-called rings of power, this one “fire.”\n Vance’s business record has been a part of his campaign since at least his launch last July. “What we need in Washington is not just leaders who talk about doing things,” he said at his campaign announcement last year, “but have actually done them and will continue to do them.”\n “J.D. made a commitment to build a business in Ohio,” Taylor Van Kirk, a Vance campaign spokesperson, said in a statement prior to the Oct. 10 Senate debate. “In its early stages it's helped to create hundreds of jobs in the Buckeye state, and it will be a catalyst for even more Ohio jobs in the future.”\n After the debate, the Vance campaign spokesperson said Vance’s estimate that he had created \"nearly\" 1,000 jobs comported with their figure of 750, and also pointed to hundreds of additional jobs Vance’s company has invested in outside Ohio.\n Narya, which paid Vance approximately $327,000 in salary last year, is backed by Thiel, Google co-founder Eric Schmidt and the investor Marc Andreessen.

The White House on Friday urged borrowers to apply, saying preparation would \"continue to move full speed ahead.\" \n \"Tonight’s temporary order does not prevent borrowers from applying for student debt relief at studentaid.gov – and we encourage eligible borrowers to join the nearly 22 million Americans whose information the Department of Education already has,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Friday night. \"It also does not prevent us from reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan servicers.\"\n Biden earlier on Friday announced that nearly 22 million borrowers had submitted applications for the debt relief program. That is roughly half of the more than 40 million Americans who the Education Department expects will be eligible for some amount of loan forgiveness.\n \n \n The program, first announced in August, offers up to $20,000 of debt relief for borrowers earning below $125,000 individually or $250,000 as a couple.\n A slew of GOP officials and conservative groups have fought to stop Biden’s debt relief plan in court, arguing that it’s an illegal abuse of authority and unconstitutionally circumvents Congress.\n The Biden administration argues it has the power to discharge large swaths of federal student loans under a 2003 law, known as the HEROES Act, that gives the Education Department special powers during national emergencies, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n The administration says that the debt relief is needed to mitigate the risk that many federal student loan borrowers may fall behind on their monthly payments after the freeze on repayment ends in January.\n The lawsuit by the six GOP states — Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina — is now before the 8th Circuit after it was rejected by a lower court judge on Thursday.\n U.S. District Judge Henry Edward Autrey, an appointee of George W.

Our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack on our Pop. We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving.”\n News of the assault rocked Washington, D.C., where some lawmakers viewed it as a culmination of their growing concerns during the last two years as they’ve faced increased security threats. Members of Congress faced more than 9,625 threats and concerning statements reported in 2021, according to figures from the Capitol Police.\n Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger sent a memo to House offices on Saturday calling the attack “a somber reminder of the threats elected officials and families face in 2022” and outlining existing security resources that lawmakers have, including residential security assessments and law enforcement coordination.\n “Across the country, the USCP Threat Assessment Section is working around the clock to stop thousands of potential threats in their tracks,” he added.\n DePape appeared to have embraced conspiracy theories and falsehoods including about the outcome of the 2020 election, the coronavirus vaccine and other political conspiracies, according to his social media and online posts.\n \n \n “It’s one thing to condemn the violence. But you can’t condemn the violence unless you condemn those people who are arguing that the election is not real,” President Joe Biden said on Saturday, adding that the attack appeared to be “intended for Nancy.”\n Rep. David Price (D-N.C.) described the attack as being carried out by “a conspiracy theorist out to kill his spouse, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.” DePape called out “where’s Nancy?” during the invasion, drawing comparisons to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol when rioters searched for the speaker.\n “Evidence now points to an unhinged individual inspired by years of demonization of the Speaker. This is what happens when responsible leaders tolerate the intolerable for political gain,” he added, referring to consistent political attacks levied against Pelosi by Republicans.\n Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigning in Baltimore on Saturday, linked the attack to political rhetoric that she said is “promulgating hate.”\n “Something has been happening on our country where powerful people, so-called leaders, have been using the bully pulpit that they were given by the people in a way that is about the preservation of their personal power and is being used to divide our country,” Harris said.\n Other Democrats were more direct in pointing the finger at their fellow members of Congress for not pushing back forcefully enough in recent years against the rise in threats and political violence.\n “Last year, a GOP Congressman shared a depiction of himself killing me. ... Yesterday, a man sharing that member’s rhetoric tried to assassinate the Speaker and her spouse,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Saturday. Then, referring to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), she wrote: “What has @GOPLeader said? Nothing. This is who he is.”\n A McCarthy spokesperson said on Friday that the minority leader had “reached out to the Speaker to check in on Paul and said he’s praying for a full recovery and is thankful they caught the assailant.”\n \n \n The attack also put a new focus on the lack of protection for family members of public officials. While members of leadership, including Pelosi, have a security detail that stays with them, that protection isn’t currently extended to their family members. \n Pelosi wasn’t at home during the attack, which police said the intruder accessed through a back door. Instead, Paul Pelosi was able to dial 911 himself after telling the intruder he had to go use the bathroom and calling from there, where his phone had been charging, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n Congress has doled out money to help fortify the Capitol complex in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack. And, in response to pressure from lawmakers, members were informed earlier this year that the House sergeant-at-arms would cover up to $10,000 for security equipment at their homes. \n But that has hardly squashed concerns among lawmakers, with one predicting that Capitol Police will review security protections for the family members of congressional leaders in the wake of Friday’s assault.

Issues such as abortion and transgender rights were at the center of the debate for evangelical Christians, who account for <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/news/2022-08-25/why-brazils-bolsonaro-is-courting-evangelicals-in-the-worlds-biggest-catholic-nation\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a third of Brazilians&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wlrn.org/news/2022-08-25/why-brazils-bolsonaro-is-courting-evangelicals-in-the-worlds-biggest-catholic-nation&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b893b000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b893b0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a third of Brazilians</a> and were among Bolsonaro’s strongest supporters. Evangelical churches had also actively campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018, and in return received tax exemptions, appointments to several ministries, the removal of LGBTQ protections from public guidelines and a pastor in the Supreme Court. It’s a replay of what happened in the United States: Evangelical Christians were instrumental in Trump’s 2016 election, and he then delivered a Supreme Court that overturned abortion rights.<br></p> <br> <p>In addition to the surprisingly high support for Bolsonaro, his far-right allies did tremendously well in the elections for Congress, consolidating their grip on the legislative process through an alliance that now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/right-wing-wins-brazils-congress-show-staying-power-bolsonarismo-2022-10-03/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/right-wing-wins-brazils-congress-show-staying-power-bolsonarismo-2022-10-03/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b893b0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b893b0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate</a>.

This political straitjacket will narrow the range of governmental action to bring welfare to the precarious majority. Government inaction would in turn increase popular discontent, eroding the legitimacy of social democratic forces in Brazil and preparing the ground for a stronger Bolsonarista comeback.</p> <p>The far right is also resurging in Italy, the EU’s third-biggest economy.</p> <p>For the past year and a half, Italy has been administered by a technocratic “national unity” government, which briefly brought together left-populist, center and far-right parties, and was led by Mario Draghi, the former governor of the European Central Bank. Giorgia Meloni’s party, Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy), which she co-founded in 2012 and that controlled just 4 percent of Parliament, was the only one in opposition. This hardline, uncompromising stance against the pro-EU technocratic government yielded fruits after the Draghi government collapsed in July. In the recent snap election, Meloni campaigned with the slogan <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/italy-election-who-is-giorgia-meloni-the-star-of-the-far-right/a-62604896\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“Italy and Italians first!”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/italy-election-who-is-giorgia-meloni-the-star-of-the-far-right/a-62604896&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b893c0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2c7b-d0bf-a7a6-7e7b893c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">“Italy and Italians first!”</a> and her coalition, which includes the far-right Lega Nord as well as Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party Forza Italia, achieved 44 percent of the vote.

Elections are, once again, bringing far-right nationalist leaders to power around the world. For decades, representative democracies have allowed for increasing accumulation of wealth at the top and growing precarity for the working classes — a fertile ground for the far right to capitalize on discontent.\n Far-right leaders are selling popular empowerment based on the discrimination and oppression of “the other”: immigrants, gender dissidents, feminists, religious minorities, left-wing “radicals,” the indigenous and the poor. Meanwhile, mainstream progressive governments have consistently failed to deliver broadly shared prosperity and economic security. It should not be so surprising then that people have ended up supporting a kind of politics that at least gives them symbolic power.\n The far right is currently ruling in: Hungary with Viktor Orbán, who has come out against race mixing in Europe and was a speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas this summer; Poland with the Christian nationalist party, Law and Justice, which opposes gay marriage, abortion and immigration; India, the most populous representative democracy in the world, with Narendra Modi, who has pursued Hindu-nationalist policies against religious minorities; Turkey with the imposition of Islamic nationalism and the ethnic cleansing against Kurds by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; Brazil with Jair Bolsonaro, who has denounced “homosexual fundamentalists,” called indigenous peoples “parasites” and advanced agribusiness by promoting the burning of the Amazon basin; and more recently, Italy with Giorgia Meloni, heir to Mussolini’s fascist legacy, the new prime minister after her right-wing coalition achieved a majority in Parliament.\n The current surge of MAGA Republicans running for Congress and Donald Trump’s likely 2024 bid to reclaim the White House are part of this trend.\n \n \n But to better understand the rise of the global far right, look to the two most recent elections involving Christian nationalist candidates: the presidential and congressional elections in Brazil and the parliamentary election in Italy. In both, far-right leaders have effectively appealed to ethnicity — particularly religion — and used largely unregulated social media platforms to amplify propaganda and “fake news” that further normalizes extreme ideas and the demand to establish discriminatory policies.\n The far right paved its way to power in Brazil, the largest Latin American economy, after launching attacks on the leaders of the ruling Workers’ Party (PT). In 2016, through lawfare — the misuse of rules and procedures as a political weapon — Congress impeached and removed President Dilma Rousseff on charges of accounting irregularities (which were later dismissed), and the courts prosecuted former President Lula da Silva on corruption charges in a trial that did not respect due process (and where the judge and lead prosecutor conspired to convict him so he could not run for president in 2018).\n After Lula was arrested, Bolsonaro, an ex-military officer who called Hitler “a great strategist” and believes Brazil is “a Christian country,” became the front runner and was elected in a runoff with 55 percent of the vote. Bolsonaro has spent the last four years in office divisively governing as the “Trump of the Tropics.”\n On Oct. 2, Bolsonaro faced a rematch with Lula, who was ultimately vindicated after wrongfully spending 548 days in prison. In the first round of the Brazilian presidential election, Lula came in first, with 48 percent of the vote — two points short of the majority to win outright. Bolsonaro, who had campaigned to “make Brazil great,” took second place with 43 percent of the vote — seven points more than any poll had forecasted.\n Perhaps the most important factor at the end of the campaign was the proliferation of fake news stating that Lula would persecute Christians and close churches if elected, which helped Bolsonaro lure centrist votes to his side.\n Bolsonaro constantly used religion on the trail as a cultural identity marker in a bid to re-impose eroded patriarchal hierarchies and traditions. Issues such as abortion and transgender rights were at the center of the debate for evangelical Christians, who account for a third of Brazilians and were among Bolsonaro’s strongest supporters. Evangelical churches had also actively campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018, and in return received tax exemptions, appointments to several ministries, the removal of LGBTQ protections from public guidelines and a pastor in the Supreme Court. It’s a replay of what happened in the United States: Evangelical Christians were instrumental in Trump’s 2016 election, and he then delivered a Supreme Court that overturned abortion rights.\n \n In addition to the surprisingly high support for Bolsonaro, his far-right allies did tremendously well in the elections for Congress, consolidating their grip on the legislative process through an alliance that now controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate. More than a third of the lower house and 10 percent of the Senate are controlled by the Evangelical Parliamentary Front.\n This means that even if Lula defeats Bolsonaro in the runoff election on Oct. 30, he will have to deal with an aggressive conservative Congress, willing to block legislation and impeach him and his ministers. This political straitjacket will narrow the range of governmental action to bring welfare to the precarious majority. Government inaction would in turn increase popular discontent, eroding the legitimacy of social democratic forces in Brazil and preparing the ground for a stronger Bolsonarista comeback.\n The far right is also resurging in Italy, the EU’s third-biggest economy.\n For the past year and a half, Italy has been administered by a technocratic “national unity” government, which briefly brought together left-populist, center and far-right parties, and was led by Mario Draghi, the former governor of the European Central Bank. Giorgia Meloni’s party, Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy), which she co-founded in 2012 and that controlled just 4 percent of Parliament, was the only one in opposition. This hardline, uncompromising stance against the pro-EU technocratic government yielded fruits after the Draghi government collapsed in July. In the recent snap election, Meloni campaigned with the slogan “Italy and Italians first!” and her coalition, which includes the far-right Lega Nord as well as Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party Forza Italia, achieved 44 percent of the vote. Brothers of Italy was the most voted party in Parliament with 26 percent, which paved the way for Meloni to become the first female prime minister of Italy.\n \n Brothers of Italy is the successor of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), which was active but marginal until 1995. In addition to occupying the same headquarters as MSI in Rome and using its central symbol, the tricolor flame, Brothers of Italy follow closely the 1926 fascist doctrine to protect the “State, family, morality and the economy.” Meloni, a Christian nationalist who praised Mussolini when she was younger, has promised to “defend God, country, and family.” Her rhetoric comes straight from the far-right playbook. She has proposed a naval blockade against migrants (a measure that was declared a violation of human rights by the European Court of Human Rights in 2012), to “protect human life from conception” (abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978 and has been reaffirmed in two national referendums) and to cut taxes. In a speech in a meeting with the Spanish far-right party Vox in June, she laid out the principles of her neo-fascist ideology: “yes to the natural family … no to gender ideology … yes to the universality of the Cross … no to mass immigration, yes to jobs for our citizens, no to international finance.”\n Meloni’s victory is partially due to anti-establishment sentiments after the failure of successive governments to improve living conditions, as well as to the spreading of fake news that appealed to people’s fear of “the other.” On the campaign trail, immigration was a hot topic and voters were bombarded with xenophobic posts and manipulated content. In the days leading up to the vote, fake videos and images of alleged immigrants beating up or abusing people were pumped through Facebook and Twitter, further tilting the scales.\n The far right is today a transnational network, so it is not surprising that similar tactics to lure people into a sense of empowerment based on the oppression of others are now at work in American politics.\n Moreover, the Biden administration has not substantially improved the living conditions of the majority in the face of stiff conservative resistance and its own reluctance to act boldly.

But there's one sector of the nation's capital that is quite familiar with him — financial regulators — and those relationships give a glimpse of how he may deal with D.C.\n Even though the new British prime minister lived in the U.S. for five years, the networks he built in California — as a student and hedge fund partner — rarely extend to Washington. Sunak, 42, joined the British Cabinet in February 2020, just as Covid began to disrupt travel. And unlike his predecessor Liz Truss, Sunak hasn’t cultivated a conservative network in Washington.\n That means he’s got a lot of work to do in D.C.. \n The U.K.-U.S. \"special relationship\" depends on actual relationships. Sunak's dearth of them means that — beyond the Treasury — he will have to build those bonds on the fly as he confronts enormous challenges, from the West's strategy on Ukraine to calming global financial markets.\n POLITICO contacted more than a dozen senior American officials, think tankers and bankers: most had nothing to share about Sunak — because they’d never dealt with him before.\n \n \n While Sunak is a conservative and the Biden administration prides itself on its progressive policy positions, those who know Sunak best in Washington — Treasury officials — are emphatic in their praise. They cited Sunak’s willingness to overcome policy differences, and to solve thorny problems to justify their views. \n When Janet met Rishi\n Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen first met Sunak in London, during the U.K. G-7 presidency in 2021, maintaining a rhythm of regular contact until Sunak resigned from his own treasury post in July, helping to force Boris Johnson out of Downing Street.\n A person familiar with Sunak’s relationship with Treasury officials said he and Yellen “developed a very, very warm and friendly relationship, but also very business-like: they accomplish things.”\n That’s the type of relationship the White House is looking for from London: no more market chaos, and fewer confrontations with the EU over Irish border arrangements.\n “I think people actually see this as a settling down and getting back on an even track after some fairly interesting and momentous events this year,” U.K. Ambassador Karen Pierce said in an interview.\n After this year’s revolving door in Downing Street and other British ministries, U.S. officials say they’ll be happy if Sunak and his team stick to a predictable line.\n “They will expect an inward focus from Sunak, especially to try and get the economic basics back on track,” said Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. “U.K. policy on Ukraine will remain the same, which is good, and for the rest they have to have a predictable G-7 partner.”\n \n \n The Yellen-Sunak relationship was forged during tense negotiations last year to establish a global minimum tax for large international companies and efforts to punish Russia for invading Ukraine.\n Yellen and Sunak worked hand-in-hand during the tax talks which involved more than 130 governments, and dragged on throughout 2021, “Many countries had red lines, but they were determined to find a way through,” said the person familiar with the efforts to fend off defections and win over holdouts including Ireland, which had made a 12.5 percent corporate rate the foundation of its national economic model. \n The individual, who has participated in meetings with Sunak, said the new PM’s relationship with Yellen extended to dinners and a private tour of the Treasury building. The person and others were granted anonymity to allow them to speak freely about Sunak.\n With the global tax deal done, Yellen and Sunak teamed up to deal with Moscow via sanctions, and mechanisms to limit the fallout from the energy market chaos Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed this year.\n “He had his staff dedicate a huge amount of time to welcome [U.S.] Treasury staff at low, medium and high levels to make sure we got outcomes,” the person said.\n London vs. New York clash looming\n For all the personal bonhomie between Sunak and Yellen, the pair may yet end up at odds over one of Sunak’s passions: making London a cryptocurrency and blockchain hub.\n Sunak is the most influential world leader to publicly embrace blockchain technology to remake financial markets.\n Where the Biden administration talks about “responsible digital asset development,” Sunak — a Goldman Sachs alum and the first former hedge fund partner to lead a major economy — is less cautious, focusing on innovation and global leadership.\n Washington’s crypto approach remains stuck at the stage of executive orders and policy frameworks, while the House of Commons this week voted to recognize cryptocurrencies as a regulated financial asset.\n While Britain is choosing to go its own way on crypto, Sunak showed his cooperative spirit by working with G-7 financial authorities on developing central bank digital currencies, a crypto-adjacent asset class.\n With financiers in London now facing extra paperwork to operate in the EU because of Brexit, Sunak’s overall instinct is to do what it takes to help London catch up to New York in the race to be the world’s financial capital.\n A Conservative British member of parliament said Sunak lacks international financial connections that might move the needle for London’s competitive position: “He has hedge funds and that’s it.”\n A bit of American ideology\n Sunak has credited the time he spent getting a Stanford MBA — obtained in 2006 — with teaching him to “think bigger” about the world — and bring a “start-up mentality” to governing, as demonstrated by his approach to blockchain and crypto.\n Through his finance career, Sunak either worked for or invested in major American companies — including some that would later shape his political fortunes.\n Between 2001 and 2004, Sunak worked as a junior analyst at Goldman Sachs, focusing onU.S. stocks concerning railways and media. He was later involved in a campaign against the management of U.S. rail freight group CSX, while a junior partner at The Children's Investment Fund Management, or TCI — a London-based activist hedge fund.\n In 2010 Sunak returned to California as a co-founder of Thélème Partners, whichinvested in companies including News Corp — which owns Britain’s highest circulation newspaper The Sun, and The Times, generally considered London’s paper of record. Thélème invested more than $500 million in Moderna, and Sunakrefused to disclose during the pandemic if he was receiving a cut of Moderna’s Covid vaccine profits.\n He and his wife still own an apartment in Santa Monica and he kept his green card, allowing permanent residency in the U.S., and paid U.S. taxes until October 2021, 18 months into his role as U.K. chancellor. Those U.S. ties drew criticism that he wasn't fullycommitted to continuingto live in the U.K.\n Delivering a lecture at Bayes Business School in London in 2021, Sunak cited Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer as one of his “inspiring” Stanford professors. Sunak absorbed those professors’ capitalist ethos and the folklore of the American Dream.\n His message to MBA students back in London as chancellor: “The free market provides the best possible route to achieving the most happiness and security for the greatest number of people.”\n Shia Kapos contributed reporting","dc:creator":"Ryan Heath","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/4b/c5/146d81b14085a097c7790cc2f6ed/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1244232945"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Even though Rishi Sunak lived in the U.S. for five years, the networks he built in California — as a student and hedge fund partner — rarely extend to Washington.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/4b/c5/146d81b14085a097c7790cc2f6ed/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1244232945"}}]},"content":"Britain’s new prime minister has American roots — but D.C. is still getting to know him.","contentSnippet":"Britain’s new prime minister has American roots — but D.C. is still getting to know him.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/what-washington-can-expect-from-rishi-sunak-00063807","isoDate":"2022-10-27T23:22:18.000Z"},{"creator":"Brittany Gibson","title":"Crime takes spotlight in final Georgia gubernatorial race debate","link":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/30/kemp-abrams-crime-georgia-gubernatorial-race-debate-00064181","pubDate":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 21:36:01 EST","content:encoded":"\n        <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/c8/e7/952e8640434ea8b574c387316f47/election-2022-georgia-governor-15670.jpg\"> <br> <p>Gov.

The attack on Mr. Pelosi is just another on a growing list,” said John Cohen, the former counterterrorism chief at DHS. “These people are troubled, angry people who try to justify violence to express their anger. They are consuming content online put there by domestic and foreign threat actors.”</p> <p>One person with direct knowledge of the law enforcement conversations said that groups and organizations, including local law enforcement that specialize in domestic threats, have been pressing the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for more briefings to discuss the current climate, which they say is unparalleled in the danger posed to lawmakers.

The alleged perpetrator, David DePape, reportedly entered the house attempting to locate the speaker, who at the time was in Washington D.C. The resulting attack sent shockwaves through California and the nation’s capital and raised difficult questions about the rise of threats against politicians and the precautions being taken to protect them.\n Now, law enforcement officials are left trying to grasp whether there could be other threats to high-profile people involved in politics — and the scale of those threats — especially in the lead up to the elections on Nov. 8.\n \n \n The increasing anxiety among local law enforcement comes just one day after the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Capitol Police and the National Counterterrorism Center issued an intelligence bulletin, first reported by POLITICO, outlining how violent extremists could pose a threat to the midterms, including to election workers.\n “There have been a significant number of recent violent attacks motivated by political rhetoric and sociopolitical narratives promoted on extremist forums. The attack on Mr. Pelosi is just another on a growing list,” said John Cohen, the former counterterrorism chief at DHS. “These people are troubled, angry people who try to justify violence to express their anger. They are consuming content online put there by domestic and foreign threat actors.”\n One person with direct knowledge of the law enforcement conversations said that groups and organizations, including local law enforcement that specialize in domestic threats, have been pressing the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for more briefings to discuss the current climate, which they say is unparalleled in the danger posed to lawmakers. Their concerns have only grown as the midterms have neared. But there have only been a handful of briefings in recent weeks — many of which focused primarily on cyber threats related to the midterm elections.\n “It is unclear to what extent these threats to physical violence have grown in recent weeks as we get closer to the midterms,” the person said. “It would be useful to know about these kinds of things, especially for local law enforcement.”\n Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI said their agencies “regularly” share information with and brief local law enforcement on threats.\n Cohen said the traditional U.S. intelligence methodologies don’t always pick up on the kinds of domestic threats posed by those like DePape.\n \n \n “The people who become attackers don’t communicate in the typical manner,” he said. “They don’t associate with terrorist organizations or extremist groups. It’s not that they aren’t on the radar, it’s that we’re looking at the right radar screen.”\n A 2021 Brookings Institution study conducted after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol found conservative websites and political leaders, especially at the state and local level, “now regularly use violent rhetoric and demonize their political opponents” and that “incendiary rhetoric from political leaders against their political opponents” does not “fade away after they are given.”\n Federal agents are helping investigate the attack on Speaker Pelosi’s husband, Paul, which took place at his home in the early hours of Friday morning and left him with a fractured skull.\n The FBI confirmed to POLITICO that its San Francisco office is participating in a joint investigation into the attack alongside the San Francisco Police Department and the U.S. Capitol Police.\n \n The investigating agencies are currently working to determine both the chronology and motive of the attack. “The FBI is providing resources such as investigators and forensic analysis from our Evidence Response Team,” the FBI spokesperson said.\n On Capitol Hill, Democrats had long warned that Pelosi, as the subject of unrelenting Republican attack ads and internet conspiracy theorists, was in particular danger.

The assailant, whose online activity was steeped in conspiracy and baseless allegations about the 2020 election, had been specifically searching for the speaker, according to law enforcement officials — calling out “Where’s Nancy?\"</p> <p>\"Yesterday morning, a violent man broke into our family home, demanded to confront me and brutally attacked my husband Paul. Our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack on our Pop. We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to House colleagues Saturday evening. </p> <p>For Rep. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat and longtime Pelosi ally who is a survivor of political violence, the fault lies unmistakably with Trump, who “hasn’t let up in the vitriol he spews out” and has ceaselessly assailed Pelosi as “crazy,” “corrupt” or the embodiment of Democratic wrongdoing.</p> <p>“There’s no question looking at his social media that he was radicalized online” and “is a classic convert to the very Trumpian, very dangerous philosophy of taking people out that aren’t like them,” Speier said of DePape during a phone interview.</p> <p>“The frightening part of all this is we identify the people who have taken action — who have written, who have called, who have stalked,” Speier added. “It’s the people that harbor the same horrific positions that have yet to be identified, like the man who attacked Paul Pelosi.”</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, no stranger to Pelosi's mantle as GOP target, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1586411168880807936?s=20&amp;t=4e8OSLwX1eR-uP1R2MJ7Jg\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667066070948,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-8dd1-d850-a57f-ddd5fa8d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667066070948,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-8dd1-d850-a57f-ddd5fa8d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1586411168880807936?s=20&amp;t=4e8OSLwX1eR-uP1R2MJ7Jg&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-24e1-ddd7-afd7-3ef148700001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tweeted Saturday&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-24e1-ddd7-afd7-3ef148700000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">tweeted Saturday</a>: \"The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories.

Ahead of the 2010 tea party wave election that swept the GOP to the House majority, the Republican National Committee remade its website with a \"Fire Pelosi\" theme that depicted her in flames. Even from the minority in 2018, she starred in dozens of GOP spots that sought to link her to vulnerable Democratic candidates.\n And that hasn’t changed in what could be her final year leading the caucus. Less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Pelosi remains a fixture in Republican attack ads airing in districts from Montana to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania. Many of the ads cast her as the “liberal elite,” criticizing her for “lying” or working with Biden to “destroy” the country.\n “Biden and Pelosi are breaking our country,” the narrator reads in a House GOP ad promoting their candidate, Ryan Zinke, in Montana’s newly created 2nd District. Another ad from the House GOP campaign arm blasted Democratic candidate Eric Sorensen in Illinois for being “in Pelosi’s pocket” and “in lockstep with her costly liberal agenda.”\n However, the GOP’s laser focus on Pelosi, while hardly a new phenomenon, is drawing new criticism in the wake of the violent assault on her husband early Friday morning. The assailant, whose online activity was steeped in conspiracy and baseless allegations about the 2020 election, had been specifically searching for the speaker, according to law enforcement officials — calling out “Where’s Nancy?\"\n \"Yesterday morning, a violent man broke into our family home, demanded to confront me and brutally attacked my husband Paul. Our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack on our Pop. We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to House colleagues Saturday evening. \n For Rep. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat and longtime Pelosi ally who is a survivor of political violence, the fault lies unmistakably with Trump, who “hasn’t let up in the vitriol he spews out” and has ceaselessly assailed Pelosi as “crazy,” “corrupt” or the embodiment of Democratic wrongdoing.\n “There’s no question looking at his social media that he was radicalized online” and “is a classic convert to the very Trumpian, very dangerous philosophy of taking people out that aren’t like them,” Speier said of DePape during a phone interview.\n “The frightening part of all this is we identify the people who have taken action — who have written, who have called, who have stalked,” Speier added. “It’s the people that harbor the same horrific positions that have yet to be identified, like the man who attacked Paul Pelosi.”\n Hillary Clinton, no stranger to Pelosi's mantle as GOP target, tweeted Saturday: \"The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.\"\n \n \n An array of top Republicans has sharply condemned the Pelosi home invasion, making clear that it was unacceptable criminal behavior. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has traveled the country campaigning for House Republicans, said: “We can have our political differences, but violence is always wrong & unacceptable.”\n But as Democratic lawmakers decry GOP political rhetoric with a new fierceness, the attack on Paul Pelosi is becoming the latest inflection point in an American political discourse that's grown exponentially coarser since Republicans first embraced Nancy Pelosi as an attack-ad bogeywoman. While both parties regularly demonize their opponents in campaign messaging — Democrats slamming former President Donald Trump, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — the speaker has occupied an arguably unique position.\n Greene, for one, got stripped of her committee assignments by Democrats last year after social media posts surfaced showing the Georgia Republican liking a Facebook comment that called for Pelosi’s assassination.\n Pelosi’s fellow Democrats insist that the focus on her goes too far in a political world now defined by the Jan. 6 Capitol siege by Trump supporters. Rioters that day also chanted Pelosi's name as they walked through the building they had invaded, and some eventually ransacked her office. It was later reported that some of those who broke into the Capitol that day had intended to seriously harm the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency.\n The attack horrified California state senator Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, but he said it was “completely and utterly predictable” given the endless demonization of Pelosi by Republican politicians, conservative media and social media trolls.\n “We have an entire right-wing machine dedicated to promoting conspiracy theories, to brainwashing people, and to directing their anger towards specific leaders including Nancy Pelosi,” Wiener said. “That machine led directly to this attack.”\n Wiener added that he has faced intensifying acrimony in recent years, including a death threat specific enough that the man making it was convicted of multiple felonies last month. He attributed that to the “mass delusion” of election denial and to proliferating online toxicity that has seeped into the Republican Party.\n “QAnon doesn’t necessarily exist anymore, but QAnon is now part of the DNA of the Republican Party,” Wiener said. “The big establishment forces in the Republican Party,” he added, “they created this monster.”\n Democrats have already emphasized what they call rising, dangerous GOP extremism in some of their own hotly contested midterm races. The House Democratic campaign arm has centered its message on so-called pro-Trump “MAGA Republicans,” pointing to candidates who have supported right-wing conspiracy theories or showed up for at least some of the Jan. 6 events designed to protest congressional certification of Trump's loss.\n White reported from San Francisco.","dc:creator":"Sarah Ferris and Jeremy B.

this is exactly who we are. Political violence is an endemic feature of American political history. It was foundational to the overthrow of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the maintenance of Jim Crow for decades after.</p> <p>But today’s events bear uncanny resemblance to an earlier decade — the 1850s, when Southern Democrats, the conservatives of their day, unleashed a torrent of violence against their opponents. It was a decade when an angry and entrenched minority used force to thwart the will of a growing majority, often with the knowing support and even participation of prominent elected officials.</p> <p>That’s the familiar part of the story. The less appreciated angle is how that growing majority eventually came to accept the proposition that force was a necessary part of politics.</p> <br> <p><br><b>The 1850s were a singularly violent era </b>in American politics. Though politicians both North and South, Whig and Democrat, tried to contain sectional differences over slavery, Southern Democrats and their Northern sympathizers increasingly pushed the envelope, employing coercion and violence to protect and spread the institution of slavery.</p> <p>It began with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which stripped accused runaways of their right to trial by jury and allowed individual cases to be bumped up from state courts to special federal courts. As an extra incentive to federal commissioners adjudicating such cases, it provided a $10 fee when a defendant was remanded to slavery but only $5 for a finding rendered against the slave owner. Most obnoxious to many Northerners, the law stipulated harsh fines and prison sentences for any citizen who refused to cooperate with or aid federal authorities in the capture of accused fugitives. Southern Democrats enforced the law with brute force, to the horror of Northerners, including many who did not identify as anti-slavery.</p> <p>The next provocation was the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854, which effectively abrogated the Missouri Compromise and opened the western territories to slavery. It wasn’t enough that Democrats rammed through legislation allowing the citizens of the Kansas and Nebraska territories to institutionalize slavery if they voted to do so in what had long been considered free territory. They then employed coercion and violence to rig the territorial elections that followed.</p> <p>Though anti-slavery residents far outnumbered pro-slavery residents in Kansas, heavily armed “Border ruffians,” led by Missouri’s Democratic senator David Atchison, stormed the Kansas territory by force, stuffing ballot boxes, assaulting and even killing Free State settlers, in a naked attempt to tilt the scales in favor of slavery. “You know how to protect your own interests,” Atchison cried. “Your rifles will free you from such neighbors. … You will go there, if necessary, with the bayonet and with blood.” He promised, “If we win, we can carry slavery to the Pacific Ocean.”</p> <p>The violence made it into Congress. When backlash against the Kansas Nebraska Act upended the political balance, driving anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs into the new, anti-slavery Republican party, pro-slavery Democrats responded with rage. In 1856, Charles Sumner, a staunch anti-slavery Republican, delivered a speech entitled “The Crime Against Kansas.” In response, a Democratic congressman from South Carolina beat him nearly to death on the Senate floor with a steel-tipped cane — not entirely dissimilar from the hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist who attempted to murder Paul Pelosi Friday.</p> <p>“Bleeding Sumner,” as the outrage came to be known, was not a one-off. Pro-slavery congressmen began showing up armed on the House floor. They threatened their Northern colleagues with whippings and beatings. They talked openly of civil war and rebellion.</p> <br> <p><br><b>In some ways, none of this was new.</b> Pro-slavery forces had long been violent and anti-democratic. When abolitionists in the 1830s began sending anti-slavery literature to Southern slaveholders, the pro-slavery forces tried to ban them from using the postal service. They destroyed the printing presses of abolitionist publishers and, in 1837, famously lynched Elijah P. Lovejoy, an abolitionist clergyman — after dumping his press in the river.</p> <p>But the 1850s were different — not just in the intensification of pro-slavery violence, but in the reaction it elicited.</p> <p>Southerners had long assumed that their Northern antagonists would buckle and fold. Anti-slavery men and women tended to draw their faith from evangelical Protestantism, which favored moral suasion over coercion. They were pacifists by nature. They seemed unlikely, when faced with threat and violence, to fight back.</p> <p>That was probably true in 1850. But by mid-decade, something changed.</p> <p>It probably began with the Fugitive Slave Act, which inspired resistance — increasingly, violent resistance — on the part of Northerners. When in 1852 President Franklin Pierce sent a battery of Army and Navy servicemen to seize Anthony Burns, a fugitive who had escaped to Boston, many former moderates found became angry, and radicalized. Amos Lawrence, a conservative businessman and politician, later attested, “We went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs &amp; waked up stark mad Abolitionists.”</p> <p>Armed anti-slavery mobs increasingly proved willing to engage in standoffs with federal officials. Outside Christiana, Pennsylvania, a Maryland slaveowner and his son, accompanied by armed marshals, showed up at a farmhouse and imperiously demanded the return of a Black man whom they claimed was their runaway slave. Local residents, Black and white alike, engaged in a gun fight with the “man stealers,” leaving one of them dead and two others wounded.</p> <p>Something changed in the tenor of anti-slavery rhetoric as well. Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person and lay preacher, declared that he was a “peace man,” but white men who willingly acted as “bloodhounds,” hunting down human beings to return them to slavery, had “no right to live.” “I do believe that two or three dead slaveholders will make this law a dead letter.” In a speech entitled “Is It Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?” Douglass conceded that perhaps it was not strategically smart, given the disbalance of power, but he affirmed that it “is in all cases, a crime to deprive a human being of life” and not a sin to kill those who would. “For a white man to defend his friend unto blood is praiseworthy,” Douglass wrote in 1854, “but for a Black man to do the same thing is crime. It was glorious for Patrick Henry to say, ‘Give me liberty or give me death!’ It was glorious for Americans to drench the soil, and crimson the sea with blood, to escape the payment of three-penny tax upon tea; but it is a crime to shoot down a monster in defense of the liberty of a Black man and to save him from bondage.”</p> <p>His was a minority opinion in the mid-1850s, but it was catching steam.</p> <p>A new generation of leaders welcomed an eye-for-an-eye approach to keeping the western territories free. Subsidized by a group of Massachusetts businessmen and religious abolitionists, the New England Emigrant Aid Company offered material assistance to Northern homesteaders willing to relocate to Kansas to populate the state with an anti-slavery majority. It also furnished them with rifles (known popularly as “Beecher’s Bibles,” an homage to Henry Ward Beecher, the prominent anti-slavery clergyman) and ammunition to help settlers stave off attacks by border ruffians who pillaged Free State property and rigged territorial elections. By 1857 the normalization of political violence advanced so far that when a prominent abolitionist urged the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to furnish material support for armed insurrections by enslaved people, even Wendell Phillips, a leading abolitionist and heretofore a pacifist, rose to agree. “I want to accustom Massachusetts to the idea of insurrection,” he said, “to the idea that every slave has the right to seize his freedom on the spot.”</p> <p>It was this embrace of retributive justice and support for violent liberation that led figures like Thomas Wentworth Higginson (a Unitarian minister), Gerrit Smith (a wealthy reformer and founder of a nonsectarian church in upstate New York), Theodore Parker (also a Unitarian clergyman), and Frederick Douglass to furnish John Brown with funds for his failed attempt to organize an uprising of enslaved people. Brown, a religious zealot who came to believe that he was God’s instrument in the service of emancipation, was widely scorned as a fanatic when in 1859 he was hanged for murder, incitement of an enslaved people’s rebellion, and “treason” against the state of Virginia. Within a few short years, many Union soldiers would come to memorialize him in song as they marched through the South.</p> <p>Members of Congress, too, tired of being under the Southern Democrats’ boot. When Galusha Grow, a Republican from Pennsylvania, wandered over to the Democratic side of the House floor in 1858, Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina snarled, “Go back to your side of the House, you Black Republican puppy.” Grow, a future House speaker, clocked Keitt with a right hook and sent him spinning.</p> <p>In 1860 Rep. Owen Lovejoy, a Republican from Illinois and brother of the slain editor, rose to deliver a blistering anti-slavery harangue. In response, Rep.

Potter so thoroughly walloped Pryor that the Virginian felt compelled to challenge him to a duel — a common ploy, as Northerners tended to view dueling as barbaric, and normally declined. Potter astonished his Southern colleague by accepting the challenge and stipulating (as was the right of the challenged party) bowie knives as his weapon of choice. Pryor, recognizing that he’d likely be hacked to death, backed out, claiming that knives were beneath the dignity of a gentleman’s duel.

Before the attack, the assailant reportedly shouted, “Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?”\n This is the United States of America in 2022. A country where political violence — including the threat of political violence — has become a feature, not a bug.\n Armed men wearing tactical gear and face coverings outside ballot drop boxes in Arizona. Members of Congress threatening to bring guns onto the House floor — or actually trying to do it. Prominent Republican members of Congress, and their supporters on Fox News, stoking violence against their political opponents by accusing them of being pedophiles, terrorists and groomers — of conspiring with “globalists” (read: Jews) to “replace” white people with immigrants.\n And of course, January 6, and subsequent efforts by Republicans and conservative media personalities to whitewash or even celebrate it.\n Pundits like to take refuge in the saccharine refrain, “this is not who we are,” but historically, this is exactly who we are. Political violence is an endemic feature of American political history. It was foundational to the overthrow of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the maintenance of Jim Crow for decades after.\n But today’s events bear uncanny resemblance to an earlier decade — the 1850s, when Southern Democrats, the conservatives of their day, unleashed a torrent of violence against their opponents. It was a decade when an angry and entrenched minority used force to thwart the will of a growing majority, often with the knowing support and even participation of prominent elected officials.\n That’s the familiar part of the story. The less appreciated angle is how that growing majority eventually came to accept the proposition that force was a necessary part of politics.\n  \nThe 1850s were a singularly violent era in American politics. Though politicians both North and South, Whig and Democrat, tried to contain sectional differences over slavery, Southern Democrats and their Northern sympathizers increasingly pushed the envelope, employing coercion and violence to protect and spread the institution of slavery.\n It began with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which stripped accused runaways of their right to trial by jury and allowed individual cases to be bumped up from state courts to special federal courts. As an extra incentive to federal commissioners adjudicating such cases, it provided a $10 fee when a defendant was remanded to slavery but only $5 for a finding rendered against the slave owner. Most obnoxious to many Northerners, the law stipulated harsh fines and prison sentences for any citizen who refused to cooperate with or aid federal authorities in the capture of accused fugitives. Southern Democrats enforced the law with brute force, to the horror of Northerners, including many who did not identify as anti-slavery.\n The next provocation was the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854, which effectively abrogated the Missouri Compromise and opened the western territories to slavery. It wasn’t enough that Democrats rammed through legislation allowing the citizens of the Kansas and Nebraska territories to institutionalize slavery if they voted to do so in what had long been considered free territory. They then employed coercion and violence to rig the territorial elections that followed.\n Though anti-slavery residents far outnumbered pro-slavery residents in Kansas, heavily armed “Border ruffians,” led by Missouri’s Democratic senator David Atchison, stormed the Kansas territory by force, stuffing ballot boxes, assaulting and even killing Free State settlers, in a naked attempt to tilt the scales in favor of slavery. “You know how to protect your own interests,” Atchison cried. “Your rifles will free you from such neighbors. … You will go there, if necessary, with the bayonet and with blood.” He promised, “If we win, we can carry slavery to the Pacific Ocean.”\n The violence made it into Congress.

On Oct 28, 1922, black-shirted fascists entered the Italian capital, launching a putsch that culminated two days later when Italy’s king handed Mussolini the mandate to start a new government.</p> <p>The crowd in Predappio, Mussolini’s birth and final resting place in the northern Emilia-Romagna region, also was apparently emboldened by the fact that a party with neo-fascist roots is heading an Italian government for the first time since World War II.</p> <p>Organizers warned participants, who arrived from as far away as Rome, Belgium and the United States, not to flash the Roman salute used by the Fascists, or they would risk prosecution. Still, some couldn’t resist as the crowd stopped outside of the cemetery where Mussolini is laid to rest for prayers and greetings from Mussolini’s great-granddaughter, Orsola.</p> <p>“After 100 years, we are still here to pay homage to the man this this state wanted, and who we will never stop admiring,” Orsola Mussolini said to cheers.</p> <p>She listed her great-grandfather’s accomplishments, citing an infrastructure boom that built schools, hospitals and public buildings, reclaimed malaria-infested swamps for cities, and the extension of a pension system to nongovernment workers. She was joined by her sister Vittoria, who led the crowd in a prayer.</p> <p>The crowd gave a final shout of “Duce, Duce, Duce,” Mussolini’s honorific as Italy’s dictator.</p> <p>Anti-fascist campaigners held a march in Predappio on Friday, to mark the anniversary of the liberation of the town — and to prevent the fascists marching on the exact anniversary of the March on Rome.</p> <p>Inside the cemetery on Sunday, admirers of the Duce lined up to enter his crypt tucked in a back corner, a handful at a time.

On Oct 28, 1922, black-shirted fascists entered the Italian capital, launching a putsch that culminated two days later when Italy’s king handed Mussolini the mandate to start a new government.\n The crowd in Predappio, Mussolini’s birth and final resting place in the northern Emilia-Romagna region, also was apparently emboldened by the fact that a party with neo-fascist roots is heading an Italian government for the first time since World War II.\n Organizers warned participants, who arrived from as far away as Rome, Belgium and the United States, not to flash the Roman salute used by the Fascists, or they would risk prosecution. Still, some couldn’t resist as the crowd stopped outside of the cemetery where Mussolini is laid to rest for prayers and greetings from Mussolini’s great-granddaughter, Orsola.\n “After 100 years, we are still here to pay homage to the man this this state wanted, and who we will never stop admiring,” Orsola Mussolini said to cheers.\n She listed her great-grandfather’s accomplishments, citing an infrastructure boom that built schools, hospitals and public buildings, reclaimed malaria-infested swamps for cities, and the extension of a pension system to nongovernment workers. She was joined by her sister Vittoria, who led the crowd in a prayer.\n The crowd gave a final shout of “Duce, Duce, Duce,” Mussolini’s honorific as Italy’s dictator.\n Anti-fascist campaigners held a march in Predappio on Friday, to mark the anniversary of the liberation of the town — and to prevent the fascists marching on the exact anniversary of the March on Rome.\n Inside the cemetery on Sunday, admirers of the Duce lined up to enter his crypt tucked in a back corner, a handful at a time. Each was given a memory card signed by his great-grandaughters with a photo of a smiling Mussolini holding his leather-gloved hand high in a Roman salute. “History will prove me right,” the card reads.\n Italy’s failure to fully come to terms with its fascist past has never been more stark than now, as Italy’s new Premier Giorgia Meloni seeks to distance her far-right Brothers of Italy part from its neo-fascist roots.
