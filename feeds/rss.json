And I agreed, and the reason is because we control the election system.”</p> <p>Aguilar, for his part, wanted to run on reforming Nevada’s convoluted and outdated business filing system, an arcane but important part of its secretary of state’s office, as well as protecting access to the ballot. Instead, his race has become all about the future of democracy in one of the most important battleground states.</p> <p>“When the [GOP] primary results were announced, it just hit me like a ton of bricks,” Aguilar said. “This is about the future of Nevada as a whole.

People are starting to realize that.”</p> <p><i>Elena Schneider reported from Nevada. Zach Montellaro reported from Washington D.C.</i></p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"RENO, Nev. — A leading proponent of the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen is on the verge of becoming the chief elections official in Nevada — which would put him in charge of running the vote in the critical swing state for the 2024 presidential election.\n If Republican Jim Marchant wins his close secretary of state race, he could fundamentally reshape elections here, with enormous ramifications for how they are run in Nevada. He has called for eliminating mail voting, curtailing early voting and pushing for hand counts of ballots — despite evidence that the practice is more error-prone than using machines — and could generally make it more difficult to vote in the state. If he refused to certify accurate election results down the road, it could sow chaos in the state and nationally.\n And Marchant is not alone: He is a leader of a group of hard-right, election-denying candidates in Michigan, Arizona and elsewhere who have similar beliefs. At a rally with former President Donald Trump last month, Marchant promised that his class of pro-Trump secretaries of state would “fix the whole country and President Trump is going to be president again in 2024.”\n Despite that, Marchant’s Democratic opponent, Cisco Aguilar, says he’s still not getting the help he needs to win.\n Once little-known and often ignored, secretaries of state races are now at the forefront of the battle over how Americans vote. But Aguilar, a first-time candidate running against Marchant, doesn’t believe his race has gotten the attention and resources it deserves, particularly given the implications for the next presidential race. Instead, Aguilar said, his party largely hasn't engaged.\n \n \n “Nobody will take my calls,” Aguilar said in an interview with POLITICO between events in Reno, Nev. “That's the frustrating part. Here you are, fighting significantly hard, and yet nobody will have a conversation with you about it.”\n “People in Nevada expect me to be running a race like the governor and the U.S. senator,” Aguilar continued. “A U.S. senator has $40, $50 million? Our governor has both $15 million? I have $2 million.”\n It is a paradox for Aguilar and other candidates like him. The Democratic candidate is still raising record cash for an office that usually draws little fanfare — as of mid-October, Aguilar reported raising $2.2 million, a little less than double the combined fundraising of both candidates for the office in 2018. The few Democratic outside groups focused on these races have lapped Republicans in advertising in key states. The Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, the party’s main campaign committee for electing these candidates, already launched its largest ever TV ad campaign, dropping $11 million in Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada.\n \n But the spending is still miniscule compared to competitive federal and gubernatorial races — especially in Las Vegas, which has become one of the most crowded and expensive media markets of the 2022 election.\n Marchant’s campaign did not respond to an interview request from POLITICO. He and other members of his coalition do not regularly engage with the mainstream media, sticking to far-right outlets that often amplify their misinformation about the 2020 election.\n “Secretary of state races are critical to our country, this cycle especially,” Marchant recently said in an interview with a group called Legacy PAC, which was captured by a liberal tracking organization. “I was asked to run for secretary of state. And I agreed, and the reason is because we control the election system.”\n Aguilar, for his part, wanted to run on reforming Nevada’s convoluted and outdated business filing system, an arcane but important part of its secretary of state’s office, as well as protecting access to the ballot. Instead, his race has become all about the future of democracy in one of the most important battleground states.\n “When the [GOP] primary results were announced, it just hit me like a ton of bricks,” Aguilar said. “This is about the future of Nevada as a whole. It's no longer about Republican or Democratic priorities. This is about the future of Nevada for all of us.”\n \n \n The Nevada race also stands out because Marchant is the founder of the America First Secretary of State Coalition, a clearinghouse organization for other like-minded candidates seeking to be their state’s chief election official.\n At a rally hosted by Trump earlier in October, Marchant suggested he would put his finger on the scale to help get Trump elected. “We have something in common: President Trump and I lost an election in 2020 because of a rigged election,” Marchant told a cheering crowd while standing at Trump’s side at the rally, alleging he has found problems in elections. “When my coalition of secretary of state candidates around the country get elected, we’re going to fix the whole country, and President Trump is going to be president again in 2024.”\n “You better get him in, you need him so badly,” Trump said in response.\n The contest has also been a daunting one for Aguilar, an attorney who interned for the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) while he was in law school. There has been sparse public polling of the race, though recent surveys have shown a race within the margin of error: A poll from The Nevada Independent/OH Predictive Insights released on Monday had Aguilar up 3 points over Marchant, while a CNN poll released at the beginning of last month showed Marchant ahead by 3 points.\n A historic amount of spending has splashed across the five most competitive secretary of state races — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada — swamping Republicans in advertising.\n Data from AdImpact, an ad tracking firm, shows at least $40 million of advertising booked on behalf of Democratic candidates in those states since Sept. 1, compared to around $1 million for Republicans. In Nevada, Democrats have run $7.7 million worth of advertising in that timeframe — and none backing Marchant.\n Even so, Aguilar said that he struggled to get people in Washington to hear his pleas, outside of Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who is up for reelection in 2024, and a handful of groups focused specifically on secretary of state races.\n “Federal [politicking] sucks up a lot of that donor base and that's the constant response — ‘CCM is fighting for survival,’” he said, referencing Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), who is in one of the closest elections in the country right now. “She determines who leads the Senate. Why is somebody going to care about Nevada and its SOS race?”\n Aguilar also said that there has been a messaging gap between what regular voters want to hear and what Democrats have been saying about secretary of state contests.\n “That was my frustration in the beginning, because everybody was like, ‘fighting for democracy, fighting for democracy,’” Aguilar said. “Yes, as political insiders, that makes sense. I called my mom, I said, ‘I'm fighting for democracy.’ And she goes, ‘What does that mean?’”\n Aguilar added that talking about democracy has become “more of a normalized term” in ads now, but he still regularly talks about kitchen table issues when campaigning.\n More Democrats in the state have started to plead with voters about the importance of Aguilar’s contest. In a stump speech to Black retirees gathered at the Martin Luther King Jr. Senior Center in Las Vegas, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) made sure to name-check Aguilar, urging Nevadans to vote all the way down the ballot, even though Aguilar was not in attendance.\n Aguilar is \"running against one of five election deniers in the country,\" Horsford said, \"We cannot let that guy get elected because he doesn't believe in fair and free elections,\" greeted by responses of \"that's right,\" from the crowd.\n Horsford defeated Marchant in their congressional district by about 5 points in 2020, and Marchant sued to try to have the results tossed out. Horsford said that he thinks there is a “growing awareness” on the importance of secretary of state races, but he wishes it had developed sooner.\n “Look, this is not partisan,” he said, praising outgoing Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. “I can have someone else. It doesn't have to be a Democrat. It has to be someone who's going to protect people's right to a fair and free election.”\n Cegavske was term-limited and could not seek another term. She was censured by the state Republican Party after defending the security and accuracy of Nevada’s elections in 2020.\n Even by the standards of election conspiracy theorists, Marchant has adopted extreme policy positions. He has pushed for the elimination of most early voting in the state and has been a major proponent of hand-counting ballots, citing unfounded allegations and lies about voting machines flipping votes.\n At Marchant’s urging, a rural red county piloted a program to hand-count ballots for this year’s election. Associated Press reporters who viewed the first day of the count last week reported that it took groups about three hours to count 50 ballots, and mismatched tallies led to recounts. Cegavske’s office ordered the county to cease its count, and litigation is ongoing.\n Marchant has also cavorted with prominent proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, while claiming he did not support it himself. Marchant and fellow members of his secretary of state coalition from Michigan, Arizona and New Mexico spoke at a conference on Saturday cosponsored by the coalition and other conspiracy-fueled groups. He also recently promoted a video implying that a handful of Democrats, who represent predominantly blue areas, only won because their elections are rigged.\n But Marchant remains unapologetic. “This is an opportunity for us to save our country, and that’s exactly what we are going to do,” he said in an interview with Steve Bannon in October. “These are the most crucial elections in our country.

Looking around the world today — from Iran to the U.S. — they see women becoming more political, more outspoken, and less willing to tolerate repression. It might take some time, but “I expect these young women to change the world,” says Thomas-Greenfield.</p> <p>Held at POLITICO’s headquarters, this conversation has been edited for length. You can watch the video above and read a full transcript below.</p> <p><b>Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield</b> So on Iran, it’s a question that we’ve been asked regularly: How can we be supportive of the women of Iran? And my response to that question is they need to hear from us. They need to hear that we give them moral support, but we can’t push them into the streets. They’re being courageous. They’re being brave, but they’re being killed. And so our support has to be moral support, but it also has to be in the area of accountability, like how do we hold the morality police accountable? So we put some of them under sanctions. I don’t know whether you think that that's an approach we should take. You’ve done this kind of work before.</p> <p><b>Gayle Smith</b> Sure. I think the other thing that’s interesting about this is that Iran has been a foreign policy challenge for as long as I can remember. And here you finally have something happening which is fundamentally political. I mean, in the small “p” sense, right? It’s citizens. It’s women and girls of all ages saying “enough,” like, “we're not doing this.” And I think that gives us an opportunity, not just, as you say, to stand with them, but to send a message that even in politics and in all these countries, women are a powerful force.</p> <p>I mean, you remember, we both worked on Liberia for a long time. That agreement that finally came about that led to a woman becoming the president of Liberia (Ellen Johnson Sirleaf). Women had a whole lot to do with those negotiations.</p> <p>But I think usually politics, foreign policy is talked about as though it's just men.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> I love you mentioning Liberia. I served as the ambassador to Liberia, and I saw those women at work. And the men were still problems in trying to move the country forward.</p> <p>And as we look at the situation around the world where women have been engaged, you see change, you see movement. And we’re seeing movement in Iran: It’s happening. It’s happening [also] behind the scenes. The government of Iran wants to blame the U.S., they want to blame everybody for what is happening in Iran except themselves. But we need to applaud those women.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314453880112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p><b>Smith</b> I think we do. And I think we need to underscore the fact that they can blame whoever they want. [But] it is absolutely obvious that this is the female citizens of Iran. Nobody is telling them what to do.</p> <p>They’ve taken the bull by the horns and they’ve decided they are going to plot their own futures, and you can’t propagandize yourself around or through that.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> No, no.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> And it’s them. And I think we need to keep the spotlight on them, but stand absolutely with them. It’s extraordinary.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> It really is.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> It’s one of the most inspirational things happening on the planet right now.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> And it’s so inspiring to other women elsewhere in the world who are experiencing similar types of situations. Afghanistan comes to mind where the Taliban are forcing women to be accompanied by a man when they go in public, to completely cover themselves and not allowing them to go to school. And those women are demonstrating as well. We’re not seeing as much of it in the news as we’re seeing with Iran right now. But Afghan women are also being extraordinarily brave.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Yeah, no, I saw a story about Afghan girls demonstrating that they wanted to go to school. And I mean, there’s a Washington politician who’s a big defender of our foreign aid budget who said, “You know what the Taliban’s afraid of? Taliban’s afraid of a girl with education.”</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yes. Yes. We've been engaging with other Muslim countries to get them to engage with the Taliban. Indonesia, for example, has been extraordinarily proactive in engaging the Taliban on how to address the issues of women in the Quran, because their interpretation is not an interpretation that has been bought into by so many other countries as well.</p> <p>Again, we can’t take the Taliban at their word. We have to judge them on their deeds. But we cannot let the pressure up on them. And having the voice of the secretary general, having the voice of other members, the voice of other member states, but having women and girls express their own desires for freedom and for an education. I think it’s important for the Taliban to hear.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> It’s important and it’s very hard to turn that off. You can arrest and you can shoot and you can suppress. But I think once that’s out of the box, you’re going to have a whole lot of people who are going to be supporting, voting with, standing for those girls and women.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Absolutely.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> And I’m pretty sure the Taliban’s watching what’s happening in Iran right now as well.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> They are watching that very, very closely. And they should be.</p> <p>You know, I think people around the world watch what is happening in the United States. They look to us as an example of what they want. And occasionally we disappoint them.</p> <p>And we’re seeing that disappointment now. But we’re also showing them that we can fight against these forces and raise our voices against these forces.</p> <p>And I think that inspires other women around the world to see how women in the United States work to address the similar issues that they’re facing in their own countries.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> I think that’s right. And I think a lot of people watch the United States, you’re absolutely right. It’s also important for us to be humble in that and concede the point that we are imperfect. Which, by the way, I think helps us in discussions with other countries.</p> <p>Because if we come in and say, well, we’ve got all sorted …<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314453692112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> “Yeah, look, we got it right, just do it our way.”</p> <p><b>Smith</b> … That doesn’t work so well. And I think what we’re seeing is some huge obstacles, I think some steps backward [in the U.S.] But at the same time, more and more women, interestingly, I think across generations, are organizing, becoming more active in their communities, more active politically in the United States.</p> <p>More and more women candidates running from the local level all the way up. And I think that’s a trend that's not going to stop.</p> <p>I mean, and again, I think any time that a people, whether it’s by virtue of gender or race or religion, is in a position of having its rights fully oppressed or chipped away at, they're going to push back. They’re going to push back and they're going to organize. And history shows that and I think that's what we're seeing in the U.S.</p> <p>So I think we’ve got to keep that up and understand that the struggles of women around the world, they’re all on the same spectrum.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> And they never go away completely.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> No, no.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> We constantly have to keep fighting. We have to keep raising these issues. We have to keep advocating for women’s rights, wherever they are being pushed against wherever it happens anywhere in the world.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> And I think we’ve got to remind people that women and girls isn’t a side issue over here. It’s part and parcel of the social fabric in the body politic. And the minute we put it over on the side and say, let’s have a special initiative.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> We sideline them.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> We’re compounding the problem. </p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> So, Gayle, can I ask on Covid: How do you see us addressing those issues as we look at the impact that it has had on women? Did we take those kinds of issues into account?</p> <p><b>Smith</b> No. I think, unfortunately, the pandemic was politicized early on.</p> <p>You know, the first early discussions was whose fault is this? And that's an important issue, but that's not generally your best starting point when you're looking at the beginning of a global pandemic. I think what we know is that the health impacts are still very, very much in play.</p> <p>The economic impact on women has been extraordinary. More women have lost their jobs. More women have suffered on the health care front because attendant health care [systems] broke down and women economically were hurt especially hard, including in low and middle income countries where a lot of women are in the informal sector. So there was no relief, there was no support, there was no backup.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314453306112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>And I think, you know, maybe if we’d had another set of actors in the room when the pandemic was first declared, we could have come out with a different system. And I think one area, had there been more women in the room, for example. I tend to think women are pretty good at process, and managing a global pandemic is a lot of process. How are we going to organize this? How are we going to organize that? Who’s going to take this responsibility? Who’s going to take that responsibility? And I think that was missing.</p> <p>And of course, the biggest thing is that the world was and remains pretty fragmented.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> And when you look at the inequities, in particular in Africa, where at the early stages, less than 10 percent of the population was vaccinated.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> It’s still low. And I think, look, I am proud of what the United States did, and [what] I think people like you and I were able to do together when I went briefly back into the administration, in terms of making vaccines available.</p> <p>But I think, people growing up all over the world are going to have as one of their basic facts taught in school that when there was a global pandemic, wealthy countries had vaccination rates and access that was in the range of 70 percent plus. And poor countries were in the range of 14 to 20 percent.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yeah.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> If you think about, for example, how do you take what we’ve seen about the role of women in peace building, in conflict negotiations and so on, how do we expand that and kind of build it into the system? You know, one of my colleagues always says, if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yes.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> I think even when we conceive of peace negotiations, the main political players are often men. So we look to men for the solution rather than saying, who are the major stakeholders in the outcome of this?</p> <p>Because the motivation, and men are stakeholders, men and boys are, but women and girls are big stakeholders in the outcome of a conflict resolution process. So they need to be there from the beginning rather than just being the beneficiaries. But I think we’ve got to flip it on its head.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yeah, we tend to look at them as victims.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Yes.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Victims who have to be addressed instead of seeing them as participants to addressing the problems of victimization that includes everyone.</p> <p>And to get that across has been extraordinarily difficult, although I think we've made a lot of progress. But I will tell you, even today, I will walk in a room and look at the table, and there’s not a single woman sitting at the table but me.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Yeah.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> And so I’ve found that I have to — I can’t just sit at the table and not mention that.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> I imagine you call it out pretty quickly when you sit down.</p> <p><b>Thomas Greenfield</b> Yeah, I call it out quickly. But what has been surprising to me is how uncomfortable the men are. They do it and they know they should have women in the room. And when you raise it, they’re uncomfortable.</p> <p>But they don’t make the decision upfront that it is important to have their women colleagues sitting at the table with them. And so for people like you and I, who always have a seat at the table, we have to be voices of advocacy for the women who are not at the table.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314454383112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p><b>Smith</b> I think that’s right. And I think the other thing is we’ve got to build out the pipeline of women that are coming into the systems, whether it’s in the U.S. government, whether it’s in departments, ministries, decision-making bodies around the world, because too often it's the case that it’s men that need to decide whether they should include some other women.</p> <p>We need to get to the point where it is men and women, women and men, deciding whether they’ve got the right delegation.</p> <p>Right. But to do that, we’ve got to get more women in the system. And I think you and I have been at the work we do for a while.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yeah.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> And I think in most countries around the world, including here, we’ve seen, I think, significant improvement there. Not enough.</p> <p>And I think where we’ve seen the least is in the hard power, national security, negotiations over war, those kinds of issues. We’ve still got some serious work to do to get a better balance.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> And in political power circles. So [Liberian] President Sirleaf has put together a mentoring program for young women engaged in politics. You know, from how you run a campaign to how you manage a political position. And we have to do more of that, because so many young women don't get the mentoring, they don’t get the coaching. They’re not brought into the circle at a young age so that they learn it on the way up. And so many of them are not prepared for success.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> I think If we had a better gender balance in a lot of these places, processes would change, discussions would change.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> And just to give you an example, rape was never seen as a tool of war. It was an action that was taken. And now we know that rape of women has become a tool of war. And it’s women that brought that to the table, so that we can hold people accountable. You know, we’re holding them accountable for atrocities: But rape is one of those atrocities.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> But, you know, part of the reason I think women raise that, in my experience — and I want to be very careful about making sweeping generalizations — I think women are more comfortable raising uncomfortable issues.</p> <p>I have found in my work, in my personal life, I’m in a meeting. I’m waiting for a meeting. You’re at the airport. You’ve just met somebody who’s on the delegation from another country. If you’ve got two or three women sitting around, it takes about 4 to 7 minutes before your conversation includes things that are personal or sensitive, right. We are used to, [and] we talk about these things all the time and, I think, breaking through and raising issues that are taboo or that nobody wants to talk about.</p> <p>Putting rape on the table as now an unfortunately increasingly common act of war and political violence, naming what happens to young girls who are HIV positive because they've been married young or they have no economic choice but to sell their own bodies.

We say what we think.</p> <p>I spent a lot of time in a lot of war zones. I know your story of Rwanda, where your life was at risk. So we don’t tend to be scared of anything. And I think if I was to say, what compromise have I made, I think early in my career — but not by much — there are probably some cases where I wish I had spoken up more forcefully.</p> <p>I mean I may have raised the point forcefully, but having been voted down or countered, I’m sure there were some times that I didn't say, “No, sorry, we're going to go another round.”</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> I was sitting in a room in the past year and I had a person in that room say to me, \"When you were selected for this position, we thought you were going to be a good girl.\"</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Whoa!</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yeah, yeah. And I boiled over.</p> <p>But I didn’t blow my top — and I’m angry at myself, today, that I didn’t blow my top.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Huh.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> I thought, OK, they’re pressing my buttons. I’m not going to let them press my buttons.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> So, did you call them out, but calmly?</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> I ignored it. And I am seething to this moment.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Can you whisper to me who it is and we could go get them.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> I’ll tell you later, but I'm seething. I seethe every time I think about it. And I’ve been waiting for the next moment — you never get a second chance to blow your top, I will say that.</p> <p>And I’m sitting there and I’m like, if I blow my top, it’s going to be like an angry Black woman.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Yep, yep.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> So you’re not going to let your buttons be pushed. You’re going to show you’re an adult here and you’re going to just ignore that.</p> <p>Don't do that: You should never ignore an insult.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> I think you had the right to be an angry Black woman in that instance.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Never let anybody ignore an insult like that.</p> <p>I didn’t ignore it, I mean literally. You know, and I guess my biggest fear was when I blew my top, the whole building was going to blow up. And I didn’t want that to happen.</p> <p>I wanted to have a calm response, but I couldn’t have a calm response because I was so angry. And then after the fact, I stayed angry because I didn’t talk about it.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Well I, yeah, I’ve done the same thing sometimes of just not saying anything and then wanting to go find them.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Well, my thing was, I was thinking that when Nancy Pelosi said the other day that she wanted to punch out a certain person [then President Donald Trump], that's exactly the way I felt.

And if women do, it’s perceived differently.</p> <p>I’m optimistic in the environment that we’ve lived in — the policy, kind of Washington, kind of international affairs world — for a couple of reasons.</p> <p>One is that I find young women, generally, or at least many of them with whom I work, it wouldn’t occur to them not to blow up. Right. Because they haven’t had 30, 40 years of being expected to be a good girl, of that kind of mantra being out there.</p> <p>But the other thing is, I see a lot of different behavior in young men. And I think that’s a part of it, because it’s not just women walking in the room and asserting themselves: It’s men changing. And to be fair, there are a lot that have, but I’ve seen a real shift among people a lot younger than we are. It gives me some hope.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yeah. I really feel hopeful because what I see is that these women are not forced to make choices that we had to make.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Yes.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> They don’t have to make choices. They just do it. And they have so many options that we didn’t have. And they know it and they’re empowered. And I am very, very hopeful.</p> <p>I expect these young women to change the world. That my little four-year-old granddaughter, who says “I can do it,” is going to make a difference in the world.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Yeah, it’s having the confidence to know you can do it as opposed to having to be told that you can.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Yes.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> If there's somebody I was going to thank, certainly in this world of Washington, it would be Madeleine Albright.</p> <p>You know, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state, ambassador to the U.N., she’s Madeleine Albright. But she was also a very regular normal human being, woman, mother. Right. She’s very accessible.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Grandmother.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> And grandmother and aunt. But she was also a mentor, friend and supporter to literally hundreds of people in the foreign policy community, and especially women. She’s a — Madeleine Albright was a gem.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> So my exact same person, I was just thinking about her.</p> <p>I think about her all the time because I’m sitting in that chair where she sat as the first woman from the U.S. to serve in that position.</p> <p>She said to me when I started the job that she had the “G7” [women’s network at the U.N.] — I tell this story all the time — and I was so excited when I got to New York and I came back and I said, “Madeleine, you know, I started my G5, but I'm so disappointed. I have two fewer women than you had on the Security Council.” And she said, “Linda, there were only seven women in the entire U.N. member state system. I was the only woman on the Security Council.”</p> <p>I had to recognize that we have made some progress. We still have a lot of progress to go. But Madeleine Albright is an icon.</p> <p>She is an example to all of us. And not just to women, to men. The day she died, I was in the General Assembly, standing up at the podium, holding back tears, and every single speaker who came after me talked about Madeleine Albright. The Indonesian [ambassador] said he went into his foreign service because of Madeleine Albright. She taught so many other permanent representatives at the Security Council. I’ve met several presidents who took her classes [at Georgetown University] when they were younger.</p> <p>So she is a role model to the world. It’s not just to women, but it's the entire world. So I am so proud that I’m sitting in a chair that she sat in and that I have her — instead of wearing pins, which I would love to wear but I’m not as stylish as she is — but I really do feel like I have her sitting on my shoulder, whispering in my ear every single day.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Well, you’re going to be on the shoulders of a lot of young women going forward.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Well, that’s my hope. And I know you are.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Thanks, L.T.G.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Thank you so much, Gayle. It's wonderful to be sitting here with you and you’re my role model.</p> <p><b>Smith</b> Oh, and you’re mine.</p> <p><b>Thomas-Greenfield</b> Thank you.<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Gayle Smith both know what it’s like to be the only woman in the room. “I seethe every time I think about it,” says Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, recalling the moment at a U.N. meeting when a man across the table told her, “we thought you were going to be a good girl.\"\n Fearful of being labeled an “angry Black woman” she bit her tongue, and regrets it to this day.\n In the latest installment of POLITICO’s 15 Conversations series, Thomas-Greenfield talks with Smith, a former USAID administrator, President Joe Biden’s global Covid response coordinator and now head of the ONE Campaign, about how to make sure more women are involved in crafting the future of the world — and why that would be better for everyone.\n Smith, for example, thinks more women in charge of the global Covid response could have boosted its effectiveness. “I tend to think women are pretty good at process, and managing a global pandemic is a lot of process,” she says. “And I think that was missing.”\n Still, Smith and Thomas-Greenfield are optimistic. Looking around the world today — from Iran to the U.S. — they see women becoming more political, more outspoken, and less willing to tolerate repression. It might take some time, but “I expect these young women to change the world,” says Thomas-Greenfield.\n Held at POLITICO’s headquarters, this conversation has been edited for length. You can watch the video above and read a full transcript below.\n Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield So on Iran, it’s a question that we’ve been asked regularly: How can we be supportive of the women of Iran? And my response to that question is they need to hear from us. They need to hear that we give them moral support, but we can’t push them into the streets. They’re being courageous. They’re being brave, but they’re being killed. And so our support has to be moral support, but it also has to be in the area of accountability, like how do we hold the morality police accountable? So we put some of them under sanctions. I don’t know whether you think that that's an approach we should take. You’ve done this kind of work before.\n Gayle Smith Sure. I think the other thing that’s interesting about this is that Iran has been a foreign policy challenge for as long as I can remember. And here you finally have something happening which is fundamentally political. I mean, in the small “p” sense, right? It’s citizens. It’s women and girls of all ages saying “enough,” like, “we're not doing this.” And I think that gives us an opportunity, not just, as you say, to stand with them, but to send a message that even in politics and in all these countries, women are a powerful force.\n I mean, you remember, we both worked on Liberia for a long time. That agreement that finally came about that led to a woman becoming the president of Liberia (Ellen Johnson Sirleaf). Women had a whole lot to do with those negotiations.\n But I think usually politics, foreign policy is talked about as though it's just men.\n Thomas-Greenfield I love you mentioning Liberia. I served as the ambassador to Liberia, and I saw those women at work. And the men were still problems in trying to move the country forward.\n And as we look at the situation around the world where women have been engaged, you see change, you see movement. And we’re seeing movement in Iran: It’s happening. It’s happening [also] behind the scenes. The government of Iran wants to blame the U.S., they want to blame everybody for what is happening in Iran except themselves. But we need to applaud those women.\n \n \n Smith I think we do. And I think we need to underscore the fact that they can blame whoever they want. [But] it is absolutely obvious that this is the female citizens of Iran. Nobody is telling them what to do.\n They’ve taken the bull by the horns and they’ve decided they are going to plot their own futures, and you can’t propagandize yourself around or through that.\n Thomas-Greenfield No, no.\n Smith And it’s them. And I think we need to keep the spotlight on them, but stand absolutely with them. It’s extraordinary.\n Thomas-Greenfield It really is.\n Smith It’s one of the most inspirational things happening on the planet right now.\n Thomas-Greenfield And it’s so inspiring to other women elsewhere in the world who are experiencing similar types of situations. Afghanistan comes to mind where the Taliban are forcing women to be accompanied by a man when they go in public, to completely cover themselves and not allowing them to go to school. And those women are demonstrating as well. We’re not seeing as much of it in the news as we’re seeing with Iran right now. But Afghan women are also being extraordinarily brave.\n Smith Yeah, no, I saw a story about Afghan girls demonstrating that they wanted to go to school. And I mean, there’s a Washington politician who’s a big defender of our foreign aid budget who said, “You know what the Taliban’s afraid of? Taliban’s afraid of a girl with education.”\n Thomas-Greenfield Yes. Yes. We've been engaging with other Muslim countries to get them to engage with the Taliban. Indonesia, for example, has been extraordinarily proactive in engaging the Taliban on how to address the issues of women in the Quran, because their interpretation is not an interpretation that has been bought into by so many other countries as well.\n Again, we can’t take the Taliban at their word. We have to judge them on their deeds. But we cannot let the pressure up on them. And having the voice of the secretary general, having the voice of other members, the voice of other member states, but having women and girls express their own desires for freedom and for an education. I think it’s important for the Taliban to hear.\n Smith It’s important and it’s very hard to turn that off. You can arrest and you can shoot and you can suppress. But I think once that’s out of the box, you’re going to have a whole lot of people who are going to be supporting, voting with, standing for those girls and women.\n Thomas-Greenfield Absolutely.\n Smith And I’m pretty sure the Taliban’s watching what’s happening in Iran right now as well.\n Thomas-Greenfield They are watching that very, very closely. And they should be.\n You know, I think people around the world watch what is happening in the United States. They look to us as an example of what they want. And occasionally we disappoint them.\n And we’re seeing that disappointment now. But we’re also showing them that we can fight against these forces and raise our voices against these forces.\n And I think that inspires other women around the world to see how women in the United States work to address the similar issues that they’re facing in their own countries.\n Smith I think that’s right. And I think a lot of people watch the United States, you’re absolutely right. It’s also important for us to be humble in that and concede the point that we are imperfect. Which, by the way, I think helps us in discussions with other countries.\n Because if we come in and say, well, we’ve got all sorted …\n \n \n Thomas-Greenfield “Yeah, look, we got it right, just do it our way.”\n Smith … That doesn’t work so well. And I think what we’re seeing is some huge obstacles, I think some steps backward [in the U.S.] But at the same time, more and more women, interestingly, I think across generations, are organizing, becoming more active in their communities, more active politically in the United States.\n More and more women candidates running from the local level all the way up. And I think that’s a trend that's not going to stop.\n I mean, and again, I think any time that a people, whether it’s by virtue of gender or race or religion, is in a position of having its rights fully oppressed or chipped away at, they're going to push back. They’re going to push back and they're going to organize. And history shows that and I think that's what we're seeing in the U.S.\n So I think we’ve got to keep that up and understand that the struggles of women around the world, they’re all on the same spectrum.\n Thomas-Greenfield And they never go away completely.\n Smith No, no.\n Thomas-Greenfield We constantly have to keep fighting. We have to keep raising these issues. We have to keep advocating for women’s rights, wherever they are being pushed against wherever it happens anywhere in the world.\n Smith And I think we’ve got to remind people that women and girls isn’t a side issue over here. It’s part and parcel of the social fabric in the body politic. And the minute we put it over on the side and say, let’s have a special initiative.\n Thomas-Greenfield We sideline them.\n Smith We’re compounding the problem. \n Thomas-Greenfield So, Gayle, can I ask on Covid: How do you see us addressing those issues as we look at the impact that it has had on women? Did we take those kinds of issues into account?\n Smith No. I think, unfortunately, the pandemic was politicized early on.\n You know, the first early discussions was whose fault is this? And that's an important issue, but that's not generally your best starting point when you're looking at the beginning of a global pandemic. I think what we know is that the health impacts are still very, very much in play.\n The economic impact on women has been extraordinary. More women have lost their jobs. More women have suffered on the health care front because attendant health care [systems] broke down and women economically were hurt especially hard, including in low and middle income countries where a lot of women are in the informal sector. So there was no relief, there was no support, there was no backup.\n \n \n And I think, you know, maybe if we’d had another set of actors in the room when the pandemic was first declared, we could have come out with a different system. And I think one area, had there been more women in the room, for example. I tend to think women are pretty good at process, and managing a global pandemic is a lot of process. How are we going to organize this? How are we going to organize that? Who’s going to take this responsibility? Who’s going to take that responsibility? And I think that was missing.\n And of course, the biggest thing is that the world was and remains pretty fragmented.\n Thomas-Greenfield And when you look at the inequities, in particular in Africa, where at the early stages, less than 10 percent of the population was vaccinated.\n Smith It’s still low. And I think, look, I am proud of what the United States did, and [what] I think people like you and I were able to do together when I went briefly back into the administration, in terms of making vaccines available.\n But I think, people growing up all over the world are going to have as one of their basic facts taught in school that when there was a global pandemic, wealthy countries had vaccination rates and access that was in the range of 70 percent plus. And poor countries were in the range of 14 to 20 percent.\n Thomas-Greenfield Yeah.\n Smith If you think about, for example, how do you take what we’ve seen about the role of women in peace building, in conflict negotiations and so on, how do we expand that and kind of build it into the system? You know, one of my colleagues always says, if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.\n Thomas-Greenfield Yes.\n Smith I think even when we conceive of peace negotiations, the main political players are often men. So we look to men for the solution rather than saying, who are the major stakeholders in the outcome of this?\n Because the motivation, and men are stakeholders, men and boys are, but women and girls are big stakeholders in the outcome of a conflict resolution process. So they need to be there from the beginning rather than just being the beneficiaries. But I think we’ve got to flip it on its head.\n Thomas-Greenfield Yeah, we tend to look at them as victims.\n Smith Yes.\n Thomas-Greenfield Victims who have to be addressed instead of seeing them as participants to addressing the problems of victimization that includes everyone.\n And to get that across has been extraordinarily difficult, although I think we've made a lot of progress. But I will tell you, even today, I will walk in a room and look at the table, and there’s not a single woman sitting at the table but me.\n Smith Yeah.\n Thomas-Greenfield And so I’ve found that I have to — I can’t just sit at the table and not mention that.\n Smith I imagine you call it out pretty quickly when you sit down.\n Thomas Greenfield Yeah, I call it out quickly. But what has been surprising to me is how uncomfortable the men are. They do it and they know they should have women in the room. And when you raise it, they’re uncomfortable.\n But they don’t make the decision upfront that it is important to have their women colleagues sitting at the table with them. And so for people like you and I, who always have a seat at the table, we have to be voices of advocacy for the women who are not at the table.\n \n \n Smith I think that’s right. And I think the other thing is we’ve got to build out the pipeline of women that are coming into the systems, whether it’s in the U.S. government, whether it’s in departments, ministries, decision-making bodies around the world, because too often it's the case that it’s men that need to decide whether they should include some other women.\n We need to get to the point where it is men and women, women and men, deciding whether they’ve got the right delegation.\n Right. But to do that, we’ve got to get more women in the system. And I think you and I have been at the work we do for a while.\n Thomas-Greenfield Yeah.\n Smith And I think in most countries around the world, including here, we’ve seen, I think, significant improvement there. Not enough.\n And I think where we’ve seen the least is in the hard power, national security, negotiations over war, those kinds of issues. We’ve still got some serious work to do to get a better balance.\n Thomas-Greenfield And in political power circles. So [Liberian] President Sirleaf has put together a mentoring program for young women engaged in politics. You know, from how you run a campaign to how you manage a political position. And we have to do more of that, because so many young women don't get the mentoring, they don’t get the coaching. They’re not brought into the circle at a young age so that they learn it on the way up. And so many of them are not prepared for success.\n Smith I think If we had a better gender balance in a lot of these places, processes would change, discussions would change.\n Thomas-Greenfield And just to give you an example, rape was never seen as a tool of war. It was an action that was taken. And now we know that rape of women has become a tool of war. And it’s women that brought that to the table, so that we can hold people accountable. You know, we’re holding them accountable for atrocities: But rape is one of those atrocities.\n Smith But, you know, part of the reason I think women raise that, in my experience — and I want to be very careful about making sweeping generalizations — I think women are more comfortable raising uncomfortable issues.\n I have found in my work, in my personal life, I’m in a meeting. I’m waiting for a meeting. You’re at the airport. You’ve just met somebody who’s on the delegation from another country. If you’ve got two or three women sitting around, it takes about 4 to 7 minutes before your conversation includes things that are personal or sensitive, right. We are used to, [and] we talk about these things all the time and, I think, breaking through and raising issues that are taboo or that nobody wants to talk about.\n Putting rape on the table as now an unfortunately increasingly common act of war and political violence, naming what happens to young girls who are HIV positive because they've been married young or they have no economic choice but to sell their own bodies. Putting those issues on the table, I tend to think women are more inclined to raise them.\n Thomas-Greenfield We do and they're not frivolous issues.\n There was this tendency that these were side issues.\n Smith “These are your issues. These are soft issues. Oh, we really should do something for you, Linda, on that issue. We can have a special event.”\n No, no, no, no. We need to put this at the center of the table.\n You and I have an advantage as women in a lot of the environments we’ve worked in because we’re tall. We say what we think.\n I spent a lot of time in a lot of war zones. I know your story of Rwanda, where your life was at risk. So we don’t tend to be scared of anything. And I think if I was to say, what compromise have I made, I think early in my career — but not by much — there are probably some cases where I wish I had spoken up more forcefully.\n I mean I may have raised the point forcefully, but having been voted down or countered, I’m sure there were some times that I didn't say, “No, sorry, we're going to go another round.”\n Thomas-Greenfield I was sitting in a room in the past year and I had a person in that room say to me, \"When you were selected for this position, we thought you were going to be a good girl.\"\n Smith Whoa!\n Thomas-Greenfield Yeah, yeah. And I boiled over.\n But I didn’t blow my top — and I’m angry at myself, today, that I didn’t blow my top.\n Smith Huh.\n Thomas-Greenfield I thought, OK, they’re pressing my buttons. I’m not going to let them press my buttons.\n Smith So, did you call them out, but calmly?\n Thomas-Greenfield I ignored it. And I am seething to this moment.\n Smith Can you whisper to me who it is and we could go get them.\n Thomas-Greenfield I’ll tell you later, but I'm seething. I seethe every time I think about it.

But she was also a very regular normal human being, woman, mother. Right. She’s very accessible.\n Thomas-Greenfield Grandmother.\n Smith And grandmother and aunt.

Musk has said the platform's \"commitment to brand safety is unchanged\" since he took over five days ago. But over the past weekend, he tweeted — and then deleted — a false story about Paul Pelosi's attacker, touching off a flurry of controversy.\n It's not just Musk's tweets that are causing problems. Some analysts have seen a surge in hate speech and misinformation since he took over — including a 500 percent increase in racial slurs, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute, an independent center that tracks online trends. And Twitter's head of trust and safety said they've removed 1,500 accounts that spread hateful content since Saturday.\n It's the kind of dramatic uptick that could drive lucrative business away. \"When big advertisers leave over brand safety concerns, no one really wants the dubious honor of replacing them,\" said Nandini Jammi, co-founder of the watchdog group Check My Ads Institute.\n Mediabrands — the media arm of the advertising behemoth IPG — sent a letter to clients Monday instructing them to stop advertising on Twitter until Nov. 7, the person said. The group's high-profile clients include American Express, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Levi Strauss & Co., and Spotify and the company manages more than $40 billion in advertising spend globally. The person declined to comment on whether any of the brands have suspended ads yet.\n Katie Harbath, a former public policy director at Facebook, said Musk is now realizing how complicated it is to manage a free flow of ideas and content while ensuring advertisers remain on the platform.\n \"Welcome to this world. This is what we all told you this was going to be like,\" she said. \"This is all mind-boggling to me. For somebody that is smart, to seemingly be so naive.\"\n \nMusk had previously told advertisers he didn't want the platform to become a \"free-for-all hellscape\" and wanted it to be \"warm and welcoming to all.\" \n Mediabrands recommended its clients stop advertising on Twitter \"until we have more clarity on Twitter's plans for trust and safety and organizational capabilities to deliver on those commitments,\" the person said.\n The controversy rocking Twitter is drawing notice on Capitol Hill as well. \n \"Free speech does not include spreading misinformation to downplay political violence,\" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who also is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n The Mediabrands' outreach to clients came the same day that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media posted an open letter to Twitter — which called for improving safety on the platform for advertisers. GARM is a cross-industry initiative formed by the World Federation of Advertisers to address harmful content on digital media platforms.\n Sarah Personette, Twitter's former chief customer officer, tweeted that she resigned on Friday. Earlier, she tweeted on Monday that Twitter takes its partnership with GARM \"seriously,\" while tagging Musk.\n Also, on Tuesday, 40 civil society groups wrote an open letter to the CEOs of Twitter's 20 top advertisers — including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta — calling on them to stop advertising on Twitter globally if Musk continues to do things that \"undermine brand safety and community standards by gutting content moderation.\"\n Additionally, a dozen high-end brands represented by luxury advertising firm GroupM said they wanted to stop advertising on Twitter if Donald Trump rejoined the platform, GroupM told the Wall Street Journal last Friday. General Motors also announced last Friday it also was temporarily stopping advertising on Twitter.\n Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mediabrand's letter.\n Alfred Ng contributed to reporting","dc:creator":"Rebecca Kern","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/3c/c6/2d39723e4169bcd4a912ebb879a0/twitter-whistleblower-congress-45060.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Gregory Bull/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"It's not just Elon Musk's tweets that are causing problems.

The correspondence was then allegedly shopped around to media in a successful attempt to “de-platform” Solomon, the reporter behind unflattering coverage of Dechert’s client, the investment authority of the Gulf emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, and the emirate’s ruler, Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al-Qasimi.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Dechert told me that “the claim against the firm is denied and will be defended,” and noted that the two Dechert attorneys named as parties in the suit are no longer with the firm.

The emirate is not itself a defendant in the suit.</p> <p>Handjani did not respond to messages. Both think tanks declined comment.</p> <p>As laid out by Solomon’s attorneys, the plot to destroy Solomon took shape after the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter started reporting on various schemes to help Iran evade economic sanctions in the early 2010s. One of those schemes involved the acquisition of properties in the country of Georgia, including a hotel owned by Sheikh Saud. Some of the sales were brokered by Azima, who also managed to be Solomon’s source. When his story ran, Georgia cracked down, and everyone involved faced risk of U.S. sanctions for helping Iran. Soon thereafter, the suit claims, Dechert was brought in to investigate fraud at RAKIA, the emirate’s investment authority. Before long, the firm and other co-defendants allegedly began focusing on the reporter behind the story.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Solomon, he gave them a lot to focus on. In a <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/special_report/the-source.php\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Columbia Journalism Review essay&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cjr.org/special_report/the-source.php&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0860007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0860008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Columbia Journalism Review essay</a>, he opened up about the way his relationship with Azima turned into the sort of entanglement that, once exposed, would imperil his career. He came to like the tycoon, accepted invitations to spend a week on his yacht, allowed his name to be bandied about in emails about possible future arms business plans, and didn’t reply with a firm “no” when Azima asked him to pass some documents to a UAE diplomat. In the essay, he says he never had the slightest notion of doing business with him, and never passed along any documents, but also concedes that the optics were rotten and he ought to have kept his bosses in the loop (and not taken the yacht trip).</p> <p>But the idea that the nitty-gritty of his emails with a source would wind up splashed across the media was a distant one back when Solomon first wrote about Iran’s efforts to evade sanctions, and the possibility that those efforts were getting an assist from the ruler of one of the seven United Arab Emirates. In those days, the reporter’s star was riding high. A report about the Obama administration organizing a shipment of pallets of money to Iran in connection with the nuclear deal got major attention. “Indeed, Mr. Azima was a source for Mr. Solomon, who had also exposed certain illegal dealings of the racketeering enterprise with Mr. Azima’s help,” the complaint explains.</p> <p>Meanwhile, according to both lawsuits, a cinematic array of violent retaliations against critics of the RAK regime were afoot: kidnapping, robbery, torture, all allegedly designed in part to stop people from squealing about dealings with Iran. (The allegations are the subject of ongoing litigation on both sides of the Atlantic, and have been strenuously denied.)</p> <p>The alleged career destruction of Solomon and targeting of Azima, in comparison, feels relatively tame — but in the context of how the Washington media and think-tank world typically works, it still feels shocking.</p> <p>“The conspiracy took the form of a hack and dump scheme, in which the enterprise through a series of transactions retained multiple, separate teams of hackers” to target Azima, his complaint reads. One group of Indian hackers allegedly accessed his email and put it in an accessible location online; another team allegedly found it “independently,” enabling Dechert plausible deniability; a third downloaded it and got it to the firm. “This scheme was designed to create the appearance that those responsible for hacking Mr. Azima, those who located the emails and those who provided them to Defendants … were all disconnected, and at the same time, enable Defendants … to control and strategically determine which emails would be shared, when and with whom,” it concludes.</p> <p>Handjani, who in addition to his think-tank positions served at a public affairs firm that worked for the emirate, allegedly helped disseminate the stuff to the media, among others, according to the complaint.</p> <p>At any rate, <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3871143/Jay-Solomon-Documents.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Solomon’s correspondence with Azima&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3871143/Jay-Solomon-Documents.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0860009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc086000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Solomon’s correspondence with Azima</a> eventually made its way to his editors at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. He kept his job at the time, but when the Associated Press reported on the correspondence six months later, he was given the gate. It’s easy to see why: In reviewing tens of thousands of pages over eight years, the reporters turned up emails that seemed to show the two men bandying about business ideas, with Solomon saying things like, “Our business opportunities are so promising” and Azima wishing him luck on his “first defense sale” when he was supposed to deliver a $725 million proposal to the UAE government. Solomon denied everything other than mismanaging a source relationship, but it wasn’t a good look.</p> <p>These days, Solomon too is affiliated with a D.C. think tank, and isn’t trying to litigate his way back into journalism’s good graces. Instead, he’s calling the case a cautionary tale — not just for journalists who blur lines with sources, but for people who think working in Washington institutions means everything’s on the up-and-up.</p> <p>“This case illustrates how powerful individuals and entities can deploy vast resources and spend vast sums with the aim of silencing a journalist,” Solomon said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Noel J. Nudelman. “And it’s a trend that’s becoming a greater threat to journalism and media, as digital surveillance and hacking technologies evolve and become more potent and pervasive. This is a major threat to the freedom of the press. And steps need to be taken to protect journalists and their ability to do their important work.”</p> <p>But it’s probably a bit more complicated than that, and not just because Solomon’s email trail essentially provided his alleged tormentors the matches with which to torch his career. It wasn’t actually Solomon’s email that was accessed — it was that of a source who had spent a career involved in sensitive work in what amounts to a bad geopolitical neighborhood.</p> <p>In the same way, the same month as Solomon’s firing, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, was the subject of a celebrated hack that led to the release of his correspondence with a variety of Washington players, many of whom had once assumed that they, too, lived in a safe world.</p> <p>“Jay and I came to the conclusion that we were both hit by the same mercenary hackers albeit hired by two different clients,” Otaiba told me this week.</p> <p>Indeed, the hostility between Iran and its Gulf neighbors, and the related standoff pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE, has a way of spilling into Washington controversies, from the downfall of Brookings Institution President John Allen (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/17/john-allen-brookings-institution-fbi-qatar-00040380\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/17/john-allen-brookings-institution-fbi-qatar-00040380&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc086000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc086000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank</a>, he was never charged but did lose his job, something that was cheered by many Beltway opponents of the emirate) to the release of emails of folks like Otaiba and Solomon (both of whom tend to be viewed with suspicion by many of Qatar’s stateside admirers and by folks in favor of rapprochement with Iran). <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The AP reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc086000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc086000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">The AP reported</a> on Thursday that the FBI is probing an ex-CIA operative for allegedly spying on Qatar’s rivals, including U.S. figures who the emirate fears are out to damage its relationship with Washington.</p> <p>Ironically, according to a researcher who has studied the increasingly prominent sorts of schemes like the one Solomon’s suit describes, the effect of all these email dumps may not be quite what their alleged sponsors hope.</p> <p>“The different Gulf states at that point on different sides of the Gulf crisis, split between Qatar and some of the others, were really trying to engage in U.S. politics in a big way, because securing U.S. political support for their side of the controversy was highly valuable,” says James Shires, a senior research fellow in cybersecurity at Chatham House in London, <a href=\"https://tnsr.org/2020/08/the-simulation-of-scandal-hack-and-leak-operations-the-gulf-states-and-u-s-politics/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tnsr.org/2020/08/the-simulation-of-scandal-hack-and-leak-operations-the-gulf-states-and-u-s-politics/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc086000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0860010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019</a>, including the one that led to Solomon’s emails going public. “Some of the ways they tried to do this was to do hack-and-leak operations that smeared the other side. … This kind of backfired a lot.

Before long, the firm and other co-defendants allegedly began focusing on the reporter behind the story.\n Unfortunately for Solomon, he gave them a lot to focus on. In a Columbia Journalism Review essay, he opened up about the way his relationship with Azima turned into the sort of entanglement that, once exposed, would imperil his career. He came to like the tycoon, accepted invitations to spend a week on his yacht, allowed his name to be bandied about in emails about possible future arms business plans, and didn’t reply with a firm “no” when Azima asked him to pass some documents to a UAE diplomat. In the essay, he says he never had the slightest notion of doing business with him, and never passed along any documents, but also concedes that the optics were rotten and he ought to have kept his bosses in the loop (and not taken the yacht trip).\n But the idea that the nitty-gritty of his emails with a source would wind up splashed across the media was a distant one back when Solomon first wrote about Iran’s efforts to evade sanctions, and the possibility that those efforts were getting an assist from the ruler of one of the seven United Arab Emirates. In those days, the reporter’s star was riding high. A report about the Obama administration organizing a shipment of pallets of money to Iran in connection with the nuclear deal got major attention. “Indeed, Mr. Azima was a source for Mr. Solomon, who had also exposed certain illegal dealings of the racketeering enterprise with Mr. Azima’s help,” the complaint explains.\n Meanwhile, according to both lawsuits, a cinematic array of violent retaliations against critics of the RAK regime were afoot: kidnapping, robbery, torture, all allegedly designed in part to stop people from squealing about dealings with Iran. (The allegations are the subject of ongoing litigation on both sides of the Atlantic, and have been strenuously denied.)\n The alleged career destruction of Solomon and targeting of Azima, in comparison, feels relatively tame — but in the context of how the Washington media and think-tank world typically works, it still feels shocking.\n “The conspiracy took the form of a hack and dump scheme, in which the enterprise through a series of transactions retained multiple, separate teams of hackers” to target Azima, his complaint reads. One group of Indian hackers allegedly accessed his email and put it in an accessible location online; another team allegedly found it “independently,” enabling Dechert plausible deniability; a third downloaded it and got it to the firm. “This scheme was designed to create the appearance that those responsible for hacking Mr. Azima, those who located the emails and those who provided them to Defendants … were all disconnected, and at the same time, enable Defendants … to control and strategically determine which emails would be shared, when and with whom,” it concludes.\n Handjani, who in addition to his think-tank positions served at a public affairs firm that worked for the emirate, allegedly helped disseminate the stuff to the media, among others, according to the complaint.\n At any rate, Solomon’s correspondence with Azima eventually made its way to his editors at the Wall Street Journal. He kept his job at the time, but when the Associated Press reported on the correspondence six months later, he was given the gate. It’s easy to see why: In reviewing tens of thousands of pages over eight years, the reporters turned up emails that seemed to show the two men bandying about business ideas, with Solomon saying things like, “Our business opportunities are so promising” and Azima wishing him luck on his “first defense sale” when he was supposed to deliver a $725 million proposal to the UAE government. Solomon denied everything other than mismanaging a source relationship, but it wasn’t a good look.\n These days, Solomon too is affiliated with a D.C. think tank, and isn’t trying to litigate his way back into journalism’s good graces. Instead, he’s calling the case a cautionary tale — not just for journalists who blur lines with sources, but for people who think working in Washington institutions means everything’s on the up-and-up.\n “This case illustrates how powerful individuals and entities can deploy vast resources and spend vast sums with the aim of silencing a journalist,” Solomon said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Noel J. Nudelman. “And it’s a trend that’s becoming a greater threat to journalism and media, as digital surveillance and hacking technologies evolve and become more potent and pervasive. This is a major threat to the freedom of the press. And steps need to be taken to protect journalists and their ability to do their important work.”\n But it’s probably a bit more complicated than that, and not just because Solomon’s email trail essentially provided his alleged tormentors the matches with which to torch his career. It wasn’t actually Solomon’s email that was accessed — it was that of a source who had spent a career involved in sensitive work in what amounts to a bad geopolitical neighborhood.\n In the same way, the same month as Solomon’s firing, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, was the subject of a celebrated hack that led to the release of his correspondence with a variety of Washington players, many of whom had once assumed that they, too, lived in a safe world.\n “Jay and I came to the conclusion that we were both hit by the same mercenary hackers albeit hired by two different clients,” Otaiba told me this week.\n Indeed, the hostility between Iran and its Gulf neighbors, and the related standoff pitting Qatar against Saudi Arabia and UAE, has a way of spilling into Washington controversies, from the downfall of Brookings Institution President John Allen (investigated for having allegedly improperly done work for Qatar, a benefactor of the think tank, he was never charged but did lose his job, something that was cheered by many Beltway opponents of the emirate) to the release of emails of folks like Otaiba and Solomon (both of whom tend to be viewed with suspicion by many of Qatar’s stateside admirers and by folks in favor of rapprochement with Iran). The AP reported on Thursday that the FBI is probing an ex-CIA operative for allegedly spying on Qatar’s rivals, including U.S. figures who the emirate fears are out to damage its relationship with Washington.\n Ironically, according to a researcher who has studied the increasingly prominent sorts of schemes like the one Solomon’s suit describes, the effect of all these email dumps may not be quite what their alleged sponsors hope.\n “The different Gulf states at that point on different sides of the Gulf crisis, split between Qatar and some of the others, were really trying to engage in U.S. politics in a big way, because securing U.S. political support for their side of the controversy was highly valuable,” says James Shires, a senior research fellow in cybersecurity at Chatham House in London, who wrote a scholarly paper on the U.S. schemes that were publicly attributed to Gulf actors between 2016 and 2019, including the one that led to Solomon’s emails going public. “Some of the ways they tried to do this was to do hack-and-leak operations that smeared the other side. … This kind of backfired a lot. When they got third parties to do the hacking and leaking, often either PR firms or law firms, the story became about the hack-and-leak operation, not the content of the leak.”","dc:creator":"Michael Schaffer","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/ab/dbd8f4ce47ccbd13b596e586ad25/capcity.Solomon.jpeg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"POLITICO illustration/Photos by Reuters, iStock","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/ca/ab/dbd8f4ce47ccbd13b596e586ad25/capcity.Solomon.jpeg"}}]},"content":"Jay Solomon claims that a major law firm and an array of others targeted him after he angered a Persian Gulf ruler.","contentSnippet":"Jay Solomon claims that a major law firm and an array of others targeted him after he angered a Persian Gulf ruler.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/28/reporter-suing-email-hack-fired-00063901","isoDate":"2022-10-28T08:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"Federal judge blasts the Supreme Court for its Second Amendment opinion","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/second-amendment-opinion-supreme-court-judge-carlton-reeves/index.html","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:20:50 GMT","content":"A federal judge based in Mississippi has released a scorching order expressing frustration with the Supreme Court's Second Amendment opinion issued last summer and ordered the Justice Department to brief him on whether he needs to appoint an historian to help him decipher the landmark opinion.

And Biden showed up a week ahead of the election even as the state appears increasingly out of reach for the party.\n Biden’s visit to the state Tuesday, his third trip since becoming president, comes after more than 3 million voters have already cast ballots, with more Republicans voting early than Democrats. Biden’s message — a warning that Republican control of Congress will jeopardize Social Security and Medicare — is tailored to the state, where older voters play a pivotal role in elections. But it’s different than the closing message of Florida Democrats, who have focused primarily on abortion and gun control.\n Crist, who is challenging incumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis, insisted Biden’s visit isn’t coming too late, contending the “great unknown” in this year’s election is the women’s vote, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to repeal Roe v. Wade.\n “Getting out the base is critical, and no one is better than doing that than the president,” Crist said in an interview ahead of the president’s visit that culminated with Crist, Biden and Rep. Val Demings holding up their arms together in front of an full auditorium on the campus of Florida Memorial University.\n During all three stops in Florida, Biden took aim at both of Florida’s senators — Rick Scott and Marco Rubio — but may have delivered his most stinging comment for the incumbent governor.\n During remarks at a fundraising reception held in a beachside home late Tuesday afternoon, Biden called DeSantis “Trump incarnate.”\n “This guy is not. ...

Still, Walker ran through the spiel about life in her purple county, how if there are six people sitting at the bar, three voted for Trump and three for Biden in 2020, and she knows all of them and where they work and what they drink and what they drive.</p> <p>If Wisconsin is one of the nation’s premier political battlegrounds, Sauk County is the battleground within the battleground, where the party lean is unpredictable and elections swing by hair’s-width margins. It contains left-leaning tourist towns in the Wisconsin Dells and liberal spillover from the college-town-cum-capital-city of Madison, as well as conservative rural villages and manufacturing centers. If you spot a parade of signs for Republican candidates sticking out of a lawn or a cornfield, or even the rare “Fuck Biden” flag flapping in the wind, you’re seldom far from a procession of signs for Democrats, or maybe even a “LOCK HIM UP.” (“Him” being Trump.)<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/ce/48423fca4a3aa01cf9dfc12043e0/20221013-wis-voters-16.jpeg\"> <br> <p>In this way Sauk mirrors the electoral closeness of the state as a whole, where four of the past six presidential contests were decided by less than a percentage point. Now, as the state faces high-profile contests for its governorship and a U.S. Senate seat that could determine which party controls the whole chamber — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, hoping to hold onto their jobs — Sauk County is a good place to study just what makes Wisconsin so, for lack of a better word, Wisconsiny.</p> <p>Because Wisconsin, at least judging by its current vicious and expensive campaigns, is not so much purple as polarized; it’s a state where <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01056-0\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“median voter theorem”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01056-0&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc08d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc08d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">“median voter theorem”</a><b> </b>goes to die. You might expect politicians in such a closely divided electorate to tack toward the center, take for granted their bases’ votes and cultivate just enough ideological crossover appeal to get to 51 percent. But another way to deal with such an even split is to prioritize turnout over persuasion, which means activating a party’s core of most likely voters, which means stoking partisanship and elevating extremes.

This well-predated the Trump-related polarization that has since swept much of the rest of the country. “I’m not sure it’s really an honor,” Franklin says, “but we were there first.”</p> <p>The problem for normal Wisconsinites is that most of them aren’t really anybody’s base; many I spoke to in Sauk don’t feel represented by the extremes of either party. Kari Walker (the Reedsburg chef, no relation to Walker, the former governor) herself was a somewhat disengaged Republican until Trump ran, and she used to consider herself pro-life as well. Now she listens to “Pod Save America” or the Jan. 6 hearings while she cooks, and she organizes letter-writing campaigns for Democrats. “Democracy is my top issue,” she said. “And my second issue would be reproductive rights.” (Wisconsin abortion clinics <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/no-wisconsin-clinics-are-providing-abortions-friday-after-scotus-struck-down-roe-v-wade\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;have ceased&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wpr.org/no-wisconsin-clinics-are-providing-abortions-friday-after-scotus-struck-down-roe-v-wade&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc08e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc08e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">have ceased</a> operation since the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v.

The manager, Sean McNevin, took me through the warehouse and explained how helium shortages and various supply-chain issues are affecting the business, which buys metals from mills and cuts them up to sell to manufacturers. Notwithstanding politicians’ vows to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest, McNevin said many of his manufacturing clients can’t find enough workers. “It’s a very strong environment for manufacturing.” His top issue is the economy, which he said was now like a roller coaster for a lot of industries, “and we’re just waiting for that drop.” He was noncommittal when I asked for his own views on the midterms but thinks it’s likely that both the Democratic governor and the Republican senator will win in November, because Wisconsinites won’t want to give either party <i>carte blanche</i>.</p> <p>By Election Day, by <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/adimpact-predicts-344m-will-be-spent-on-ads-in-wisconsin-races\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;one estimate&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/adimpact-predicts-344m-will-be-spent-on-ads-in-wisconsin-races&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc08e0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc08e0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">one estimate</a>, Wisconsinites will have endured some $344-million worth of political advertising, much of which seeks to paint the top candidates on either side as “too extreme” for the state. Voters are set to determine whether abortion will remain illegal, how voting will work in their state, who gets to certify the results of the 2024 presidential election, and possibly which party controls the U.S. Senate. Sauk County offers a glimpse into the split mind of Wisconsin on all of these issues, in a state where many people seem sick of politics, but the politics only seem to get worse, because tiny margins can have big results, and each party sees the stakes as existential.</p> <p>For swing voters like McNevin, it can all be a bit tiring. “It feels like we’re being punished for something.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6e/79/9852f63c48b381d325294594d5e3/20221014-wis-voters-23.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>On one extreme of</b> Sauk County politics lies Sauk City, birthplace of the iconic midwestern fast food chain Culver’s, which has a population of about 3,500 and which Biden won by 28 points in 2020. On the other, a mere 24 miles to the northwest, is Rock Springs, with less than one-tenth of the population at barely 300 people, where Biden lost by 42 points. “What’s interesting about Sauk County is that the denser the population is even within the county, the bluer it is,” said Franklin. “And when you get into the open countryside, the redder it is.”</p> <p>Sauk City, on the blue end of the color spectrum, is an old farm-town but also a commuter haven for Madison liberals; on its outskirts, the family-owned Dorf Haus supper club is an area favorite for fish fry and German food. (As for what distinguishes a “supper club” from a “restaurant,” family member Mitch Maier isn’t exactly sure but thinks a supper club probably needs a deer head on the wall and a reputation for stiff cocktails to qualify). Friday night patrons feigned reluctance to talk about politics, but it was pretty easy to get them going. Maybe that had something to do with the generous brandy Old Fashioneds Mitch’s brother Monte was serving.</p> <p>“It’s very divided,” said a woman named Peggy who declined to give her last name. She had no interest in further alienating anybody; she said her godchild had already unfriended her on Facebook, and her liberal friends were “very staunch,” to the point that “politics have become: ‘Well, you’re stupid,’” she said. “They elected a guy with Alzheimer’s, so who’s stupid? … I’m not a Trumper, we just can’t keep doing what we’re doing.” Her husband, Jim, is 75, a Vietnam veteran and former Democrat who said he switched parties in 2016 because “there was no way I was gonna vote for Hillary.” Now he feels Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes is too far left for the state and finds Johnson to be the better choice, but he said it’s hard to get good information. “You can’t believe what anybody says anymore,” he said. “That’s just scary.”</p> <p>A young couple, Robert Hanson and Samantha Steur, listened to this analysis and stayed largely quiet, except to agree that politics was too divisive, even in Wisconsin’s supposed bastion of Midwest nice. They opened up later at their table, over the schnitzel and spaetzle, where Steur observed that “the left is too far left and the right is too far right” — including Barnes and Johnson respectively. “We’re middle-of-the-road people,” Hanson put in: Both want politicians to try to bring folks together, and the couple sees little of that in the state’s current crop. Hanson feels alienated by the identity politics of the left, but said his top issue is democracy, and he can’t stomach voting for a Republican.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/00/1c/5d40cc51426395a179a5930f2ffb/20221014-wis-voters-21.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Meanwhile, said Steur, “There are two Wisconsins. There’s the one in downtown Madison, and there’s the one at dive bars in Prairie du Sac,” the town adjacent to where we were sitting. “I love both of them. … I don’t know how to build the bridge — or rebuild it, if there ever was one.”</p> <p>Rock Springs is a chunk of the other, redder Wisconsin, and that’s where Ken Pieper sells popcorn from an old-timey wagon about a block away from a mead distillery. Pieper owns River Creek Popcorn, which used to operate out of a storefront until floods ripped through the small downtown and destroyed it. Now, he’s conveniently situated outside his own house, which sports a sign on the lawn for Tim Michels, the Republican challenger to Evers. “There’s a stupid part of this, too,” Pieper said of working so close to home. His former sunroom is overrun with popcorn paraphernalia.</p> <p>He and his brother Dennis stepped out of the wagon to sit on a bench in the chilly sunshine and talk politics, which they usually try not to do, since they’re on opposite sides. Both grew up in Sauk County, on a farm about a mile outside of town, and Ken has a simple explanation for how his brother’s political path diverged from his own. “Ding-a-ling went to work for the teachers union.”</p> <p>Ken hopes Michels wins the governor’s race because “education in Wisconsin is trashed. … I don’t think it was necessarily [Evers] that trashed it, but he ain’t necessarily helped.” (Dennis interjected: “It was Scott Walker that trashed it. I taught for 35 years, so I know.”) Ken just hopes Michels, a wealthy businessman and political novice in Wisconsin who got Trump’s endorsement and then won the GOP primary, won’t be another Trump. Ken likes some of what Trump did for the country, but “If he’d stayed off Twitter and learned to zip his trap, he would’ve been a whole lot better politician. … That kind of worries me about Michels, I mean, he is kind of a Trump person.”</p> <p>The Ken/Dennis divide encapsulates the right/left divide in the midterms: For Ken, the economy is the top issue, and for Dennis, it’s abortion. “The economy was already starting to go downhill badly already when Covid came in,” Dennis said. “So how can you say it’s a Democratic thing when basically it’s been here for four years already?”</p> <p>There followed a semi-friendly bickering match over whether Mandela Barnes is too far left.</p> <p>Dennis: “And you’re thinking your guy isn’t too far right?”</p> <p>Ken: “You can’t get any farther left than with Mandela Barnes.”</p> <p>Dennis: “In what way?”</p> <p>Ken: “Pro-abortion, large federal government, expansion of the government …”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/19/c7e5c71a458db5b45c1ab3cad2eb/20221013-wis-voters-38.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Dennis: “You don’t think Obamacare was good?”</p> <p>Ken: “Not especially. It still was aimed at getting bigger government. … It’s states’ rights, not federal government, that needs to run this country.”</p> <p>Dennis: “So what’s wrong with abortion right now? They’ve given it to states’ rights and now every state’s against every other state.”</p> <p>Ken: “It always was states’ rights. It’s your nutty Supreme Court people called it something else.”</p> <p>Dennis: “But I think at that time it was still five-four in favor of Republicans. …”</p> <p>Ken: “It was a highly liberal Supreme Court. So don’t give me that nonsense.”</p> <p>And so on, down what was clearly quite familiar, and tiresome, terrain to them both. The political conversation dissipated fairly soon into Midwestern sports teams, about which they’re more in agreement, and a bit later the two got back to selling popcorn, wedged with their incompatible worldviews into the same small wagon.</p> <p>They seem to make it work the way Ken said the rest of the county gets along: “It’s kind of a mutual ignoring of the issues.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/75/5d/083600604b7ea5183e8fc83588f1/20221014-wis-voters-57.jpeg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>Just over the county </b>line on a Saturday morning, Leah Spicer and her sister Moriah pushed a stroller containing Moriah’s baby with a “LEAH SPICER FOR STATE ASSEMBLY” sign sticking out of the top.

Spicer jumped in when she saw no one planned to challenge Novak this year, because she doesn’t feel Republicans are representing the state well. “They have drawn the districts in such a way that they can maintain their political power without listening to their constituents,” she said.</p> <p>The district being what it is, when potential voters answer the door, she doesn’t lead with her affiliation. “I’m a little bit nervous about tying myself to the Democratic Party,” she told me. “There’s a lot of mistrust, I think, in politics in general, just like it’s something that happens far away. Politicians don’t represent us well, understand our communities, and I’m really trying to run as like a rural politician, who lives here, who understands.” She ticked off her own personal concerns: Three kids in rural public schools she says are under-funded; a small business, a restaurant she owns in the (liberal) Sauk County village of Spring Green, struggling with costs; aging parents on Social Security; family farm vulnerable to climate change. “In terms of political polarization, we’ve got to brush all that aside,” she said. “Especially in rural areas” — she gestures at the surrounding village of Lone Rock, which bills itself as “the coldest in the nation with the warmest heart,” where the trees have lately burst into bright reds and oranges — “this is all we have. There’s not a lot of people out here. And so if we’re not working together, it’s not going to work.”</p> <p>So when one older woman answered the door that morning, remarked that her concerns were “a lot of stuff — I think the federal government is ridiculous,” and asked if Spicer was a Republican, Spicer sounded semi-apologetic to reveal she was running as a Democrat. But she was prepared. She likes to tell voters, as she did here, that Wisconsinites are independent, and they vote for the candidate, not the party. The woman took some literature — Spicer pointed out that her cell number was on there, for any questions or concerns — and said she would think about it. Another potential voter, a young man wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, answered “huh” when Spicer asks what his concerns were. He said he hadn’t voted since he was 18; he was too busy with work at the dairy farm and at his grandparents’ house. “I think both sides equally suck,” he said, but “I honestly never have complained to a politician. Don’t know how.” Spicer suggested: “Maybe you should start.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/28/52/f28d7fdf4f7cb10f42dc120f0d30/20221013-wis-voters-17.jpeg\"> <br> <p>Unlike for the U.S. Senate, there is no majority at stake in Wisconsin’s legislative races: That does and will continue to belong to Republicans, due to the way Republican-controlled legislatures have drawn the districts.

Frostman, too, admits the elections will come down to turnout, and that there’s no real predicting what Wisconsin voters will do. He noted that, while Republican Governor Scott Walker ultimately lost to Evers by a narrow margin in 2018, the progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin won her Senate race by a much larger margin that same year. “I’m like, how do you cast a vote for Scott Walker and then vote for Tammy Baldwin?” he said. “It’s a strange world, and this political stuff … it’s all strange.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e5/ba/bad6dc324ed38bd41d8d4a10f4f4/20221014-wis-voters-33.jpeg\"> <br> <p>At the Downtowner bar in Baraboo — which, incidentally, was the first home of the Ringling Brothers Circus nearly a century and a half before this year’s political circus — Matt Schmidt said he leaned right but didn’t feel too strongly about it. He’s a musician and self-described “tawdry redneck,” and he was looking forward to an upcoming gig in the Wisconsin Dells and pretty happy with life in general. To the extent I could find a political consensus in close-split Sauk County, Schmidt summed it up the best of anyone. “If you’re on the extreme of either side,” he said, “you’re part of the fuckin’ problem.”<br></p> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"SAUK COUNTY, Wis. — One recent Friday, the town of Reedsburg’s most famous resident was caffeinating while she mixed up coleslaw in a big blue bowl. I’d picked up a Culver’s coffee for her on my way because I felt sheepish: Kari Walker deals with reporters every time an election rolls around, because she happens to own a bar and restaurant in the politically swingiest county in one of the politically swingiest states in the country, and it’s one that tends to pick winners.\n Everybody, she says, wants to know what “secret sauce” accounts for Sauk County’s uncanny record, including voting for the victor in 10 of the last 11 presidential elections; it’s one of only two counties in the state that swung from Obama to Trump and then back to Biden, and Reedsburg itself had gone with the winning candidates in Wisconsin governors’ and Senate races dating back to 2010. “I’ve been on the TV in France,” she’d told me on the phone the night before. Also on CNN, and in Reuters and Agence France-Presse — appearances I’d learned about from a 2020 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article\",\"_id\":\"00000184-1b67-d3a9-afb4-7f6701f10000\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article, which featured her third interview with that paper alone.\n Walker does not, however, overpromise in the manner of many other pundits. “Everyone descends because they’re hoping somebody is going to crack the code,” she said, but “I don’t think the code is crackable. You know, we’ve got 50,000 people in Sauk County, and in 2016, Trump won by 109 votes.” In 2020, he lost the county by 615. These are not margins that lend themselves to sweeping conclusions. Still, Walker ran through the spiel about life in her purple county, how if there are six people sitting at the bar, three voted for Trump and three for Biden in 2020, and she knows all of them and where they work and what they drink and what they drive.\n If Wisconsin is one of the nation’s premier political battlegrounds, Sauk County is the battleground within the battleground, where the party lean is unpredictable and elections swing by hair’s-width margins. It contains left-leaning tourist towns in the Wisconsin Dells and liberal spillover from the college-town-cum-capital-city of Madison, as well as conservative rural villages and manufacturing centers. If you spot a parade of signs for Republican candidates sticking out of a lawn or a cornfield, or even the rare “Fuck Biden” flag flapping in the wind, you’re seldom far from a procession of signs for Democrats, or maybe even a “LOCK HIM UP.” (“Him” being Trump.)\n \n  \n In this way Sauk mirrors the electoral closeness of the state as a whole, where four of the past six presidential contests were decided by less than a percentage point. Now, as the state faces high-profile contests for its governorship and a U.S. Senate seat that could determine which party controls the whole chamber — Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, hoping to hold onto their jobs — Sauk County is a good place to study just what makes Wisconsin so, for lack of a better word, Wisconsiny.\n Because Wisconsin, at least judging by its current vicious and expensive campaigns, is not so much purple as polarized; it’s a state where “median voter theorem” goes to die. You might expect politicians in such a closely divided electorate to tack toward the center, take for granted their bases’ votes and cultivate just enough ideological crossover appeal to get to 51 percent. But another way to deal with such an even split is to prioritize turnout over persuasion, which means activating a party’s core of most likely voters, which means stoking partisanship and elevating extremes. By no means is the “base election” a Wisconsin innovation à la unemployment insurance or the ButterBurger — some credit Karl Rove with the nationwide 21st-century version — but the state does dramatically show off the result. Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate delegation is perhaps the most polarized in the country, with the same state having sent to Washington, not two moderates, but one of the Senate’s most conservative members in Johnson and one of its most liberal in Tammy Baldwin.\n \n  \n “Everything makes a big difference when the race is decided by 23,000 votes,” said Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “So both parties think everything matters” — like, say, the ballot drop boxes and election-related grant money that fueled a widespread and mistaken belief among Republicans that Joe Biden did not win the state fairly in 2020. “The paradox of really close elections in a very polarized partisan environment is the parties pay an awful lot of attention to pandering to their base, because they absolutely need every partisan vote they can get.” Franklin traces the state’s sharp polarization back to the era of Republican Governor Scott Walker and the fights over public-sector unions beginning in 2011, which he says poisoned intra-party cooperation and helped usher in a winner-take-all partisanship. This well-predated the Trump-related polarization that has since swept much of the rest of the country. “I’m not sure it’s really an honor,” Franklin says, “but we were there first.”\n The problem for normal Wisconsinites is that most of them aren’t really anybody’s base; many I spoke to in Sauk don’t feel represented by the extremes of either party. Kari Walker (the Reedsburg chef, no relation to Walker, the former governor) herself was a somewhat disengaged Republican until Trump ran, and she used to consider herself pro-life as well. Now she listens to “Pod Save America” or the Jan. 6 hearings while she cooks, and she organizes letter-writing campaigns for Democrats. “Democracy is my top issue,” she said. “And my second issue would be reproductive rights.” (Wisconsin abortion clinics have ceased operation since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, under an 1849 state law that bans abortions.) I also met people in Sauk who weren’t Republicans until Trump ran, who maybe didn’t love the tweeting but certainly dislike this current inflation-rattled economy much more. My conversations in Sauk County mirrored the results of Franklin’s latest poll for Marquette: There’s almost no overlap in the top issues for likely Democratic and likely Republican voters. For Democrats it’s gun violence and abortion; for Republicans it’s inflation and crime.\n \n  \n Five minutes or so down East Main Street from Walker’s restaurant, Wisconsin Metals has a “help wanted” sign out front in search of a fabricator. The manager, Sean McNevin, took me through the warehouse and explained how helium shortages and various supply-chain issues are affecting the business, which buys metals from mills and cuts them up to sell to manufacturers. Notwithstanding politicians’ vows to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest, McNevin said many of his manufacturing clients can’t find enough workers. “It’s a very strong environment for manufacturing.” His top issue is the economy, which he said was now like a roller coaster for a lot of industries, “and we’re just waiting for that drop.” He was noncommittal when I asked for his own views on the midterms but thinks it’s likely that both the Democratic governor and the Republican senator will win in November, because Wisconsinites won’t want to give either party carte blanche.\n By Election Day, by one estimate, Wisconsinites will have endured some $344-million worth of political advertising, much of which seeks to paint the top candidates on either side as “too extreme” for the state. Voters are set to determine whether abortion will remain illegal, how voting will work in their state, who gets to certify the results of the 2024 presidential election, and possibly which party controls the U.S. Senate. Sauk County offers a glimpse into the split mind of Wisconsin on all of these issues, in a state where many people seem sick of politics, but the politics only seem to get worse, because tiny margins can have big results, and each party sees the stakes as existential.\n For swing voters like McNevin, it can all be a bit tiring. “It feels like we’re being punished for something.”\n \n  \n  \nOn one extreme of Sauk County politics lies Sauk City, birthplace of the iconic midwestern fast food chain Culver’s, which has a population of about 3,500 and which Biden won by 28 points in 2020. On the other, a mere 24 miles to the northwest, is Rock Springs, with less than one-tenth of the population at barely 300 people, where Biden lost by 42 points. “What’s interesting about Sauk County is that the denser the population is even within the county, the bluer it is,” said Franklin. “And when you get into the open countryside, the redder it is.”\n Sauk City, on the blue end of the color spectrum, is an old farm-town but also a commuter haven for Madison liberals; on its outskirts, the family-owned Dorf Haus supper club is an area favorite for fish fry and German food. (As for what distinguishes a “supper club” from a “restaurant,” family member Mitch Maier isn’t exactly sure but thinks a supper club probably needs a deer head on the wall and a reputation for stiff cocktails to qualify). Friday night patrons feigned reluctance to talk about politics, but it was pretty easy to get them going. Maybe that had something to do with the generous brandy Old Fashioneds Mitch’s brother Monte was serving.\n “It’s very divided,” said a woman named Peggy who declined to give her last name. She had no interest in further alienating anybody; she said her godchild had already unfriended her on Facebook, and her liberal friends were “very staunch,” to the point that “politics have become: ‘Well, you’re stupid,’” she said. “They elected a guy with Alzheimer’s, so who’s stupid? … I’m not a Trumper, we just can’t keep doing what we’re doing.” Her husband, Jim, is 75, a Vietnam veteran and former Democrat who said he switched parties in 2016 because “there was no way I was gonna vote for Hillary.” Now he feels Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes is too far left for the state and finds Johnson to be the better choice, but he said it’s hard to get good information. “You can’t believe what anybody says anymore,” he said. “That’s just scary.”\n A young couple, Robert Hanson and Samantha Steur, listened to this analysis and stayed largely quiet, except to agree that politics was too divisive, even in Wisconsin’s supposed bastion of Midwest nice. They opened up later at their table, over the schnitzel and spaetzle, where Steur observed that “the left is too far left and the right is too far right” — including Barnes and Johnson respectively. “We’re middle-of-the-road people,” Hanson put in: Both want politicians to try to bring folks together, and the couple sees little of that in the state’s current crop. Hanson feels alienated by the identity politics of the left, but said his top issue is democracy, and he can’t stomach voting for a Republican.\n \n  \n Meanwhile, said Steur, “There are two Wisconsins. There’s the one in downtown Madison, and there’s the one at dive bars in Prairie du Sac,” the town adjacent to where we were sitting. “I love both of them. … I don’t know how to build the bridge — or rebuild it, if there ever was one.”\n Rock Springs is a chunk of the other, redder Wisconsin, and that’s where Ken Pieper sells popcorn from an old-timey wagon about a block away from a mead distillery. Pieper owns River Creek Popcorn, which used to operate out of a storefront until floods ripped through the small downtown and destroyed it. Now, he’s conveniently situated outside his own house, which sports a sign on the lawn for Tim Michels, the Republican challenger to Evers. “There’s a stupid part of this, too,” Pieper said of working so close to home. His former sunroom is overrun with popcorn paraphernalia.\n He and his brother Dennis stepped out of the wagon to sit on a bench in the chilly sunshine and talk politics, which they usually try not to do, since they’re on opposite sides. Both grew up in Sauk County, on a farm about a mile outside of town, and Ken has a simple explanation for how his brother’s political path diverged from his own. “Ding-a-ling went to work for the teachers union.”\n Ken hopes Michels wins the governor’s race because “education in Wisconsin is trashed. … I don’t think it was necessarily [Evers] that trashed it, but he ain’t necessarily helped.” (Dennis interjected: “It was Scott Walker that trashed it. I taught for 35 years, so I know.”) Ken just hopes Michels, a wealthy businessman and political novice in Wisconsin who got Trump’s endorsement and then won the GOP primary, won’t be another Trump. Ken likes some of what Trump did for the country, but “If he’d stayed off Twitter and learned to zip his trap, he would’ve been a whole lot better politician. … That kind of worries me about Michels, I mean, he is kind of a Trump person.”\n The Ken/Dennis divide encapsulates the right/left divide in the midterms: For Ken, the economy is the top issue, and for Dennis, it’s abortion. “The economy was already starting to go downhill badly already when Covid came in,” Dennis said. “So how can you say it’s a Democratic thing when basically it’s been here for four years already?”\n There followed a semi-friendly bickering match over whether Mandela Barnes is too far left.\n Dennis: “And you’re thinking your guy isn’t too far right?”\n Ken: “You can’t get any farther left than with Mandela Barnes.”\n Dennis: “In what way?”\n Ken: “Pro-abortion, large federal government, expansion of the government …”\n \n  \n Dennis: “You don’t think Obamacare was good?”\n Ken: “Not especially. It still was aimed at getting bigger government. … It’s states’ rights, not federal government, that needs to run this country.”\n Dennis: “So what’s wrong with abortion right now? They’ve given it to states’ rights and now every state’s against every other state.”\n Ken: “It always was states’ rights. It’s your nutty Supreme Court people called it something else.”\n Dennis: “But I think at that time it was still five-four in favor of Republicans. …”\n Ken: “It was a highly liberal Supreme Court. So don’t give me that nonsense.”\n And so on, down what was clearly quite familiar, and tiresome, terrain to them both. The political conversation dissipated fairly soon into Midwestern sports teams, about which they’re more in agreement, and a bit later the two got back to selling popcorn, wedged with their incompatible worldviews into the same small wagon.\n They seem to make it work the way Ken said the rest of the county gets along: “It’s kind of a mutual ignoring of the issues.”\n \n  \n  \nJust over the county line on a Saturday morning, Leah Spicer and her sister Moriah pushed a stroller containing Moriah’s baby with a “LEAH SPICER FOR STATE ASSEMBLY” sign sticking out of the top. The kid mostly napped while Spicer knocked on doors and introduced herself to potential voters in the 51st District, the most competitive of the three assembly districts that contain parts of Sauk County. (Of the two others, naturally, one is held by a Democrat and the other by a Republican.)\n Spicer is a 29-year-old Democrat hoping to unseat the four-term Republican Assemblyman Todd Novak. She thinks she’s got a decent shot, although the district is R+1, and a CNalysis state legislative forecast favors Novak. She points out Novak won his first race by 65 votes, although last cycle he had his best margin ever with 1,258 votes (out of about 30,000 cast in the race). Spicer jumped in when she saw no one planned to challenge Novak this year, because she doesn’t feel Republicans are representing the state well. “They have drawn the districts in such a way that they can maintain their political power without listening to their constituents,” she said.\n The district being what it is, when potential voters answer the door, she doesn’t lead with her affiliation. “I’m a little bit nervous about tying myself to the Democratic Party,” she told me. “There’s a lot of mistrust, I think, in politics in general, just like it’s something that happens far away. Politicians don’t represent us well, understand our communities, and I’m really trying to run as like a rural politician, who lives here, who understands.” She ticked off her own personal concerns: Three kids in rural public schools she says are under-funded; a small business, a restaurant she owns in the (liberal) Sauk County village of Spring Green, struggling with costs; aging parents on Social Security; family farm vulnerable to climate change. “In terms of political polarization, we’ve got to brush all that aside,” she said. “Especially in rural areas” — she gestures at the surrounding village of Lone Rock, which bills itself as “the coldest in the nation with the warmest heart,” where the trees have lately burst into bright reds and oranges — “this is all we have. There’s not a lot of people out here. And so if we’re not working together, it’s not going to work.”\n So when one older woman answered the door that morning, remarked that her concerns were “a lot of stuff — I think the federal government is ridiculous,” and asked if Spicer was a Republican, Spicer sounded semi-apologetic to reveal she was running as a Democrat. But she was prepared. She likes to tell voters, as she did here, that Wisconsinites are independent, and they vote for the candidate, not the party. The woman took some literature — Spicer pointed out that her cell number was on there, for any questions or concerns — and said she would think about it. Another potential voter, a young man wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, answered “huh” when Spicer asks what his concerns were. He said he hadn’t voted since he was 18; he was too busy with work at the dairy farm and at his grandparents’ house. “I think both sides equally suck,” he said, but “I honestly never have complained to a politician. Don’t know how.” Spicer suggested: “Maybe you should start.”\n \n  \n Unlike for the U.S. Senate, there is no majority at stake in Wisconsin’s legislative races: That does and will continue to belong to Republicans, due to the way Republican-controlled legislatures have drawn the districts. (A common Democratic complaint in the state is that, while Wisconsin voted 49.4/48.8 in favor of Biden over Trump in 2020, Republicans control 58 percent of the seats in the state Assembly and 64 percent of the seats in the state Senate.) But in some ways the stakes are even higher, because the question is whether Republicans will get a legislative supermajority that can override a governor’s veto, for which they would only need five additional seats in the Assembly and one in the Senate. Democrat Tony Evers has vetoed a record 126 bills this legislative session alone on wildly polarized issues from gun rights to school choice to unemployment benefits. Michels has vowed to sign them if elected, but with a legislative supermajority, Republicans wouldn’t even need the governor’s office to turn those bills into law.\n \n  \n Given how few competitive legislative districts are left, the Sauk County Democrats are hoping to gain some ground in the 51st. At a debate watch party in the Sauk Dems’ office, which shares space with a flooring store in a strip mall in the county seat of Baraboo, a spectator grumbled when Michels vowed to leave abortion access up to the legislature which, Michels said, represents the people of the state. “Not in Wisconsin, it doesn’t,” said the Sauk Democrat. The Democratic chair for the county is Tammy Wood, who sports blue highlights in her hair and is fired up for November. “I’m feeling good about it all,” she told me after the debate. She says she’s not even worried about Mandela Barnes’ lackluster recent polling against Ron Johnson, that it’s remarkable Dems are running so close to Republicans while their party is in power nationally. “But we’re gonna have to bust knuckle to make it happen. … We cannot go back to that same ‘divide and conquer’” that she says characterized the Scott Walker era.\n \n  \n But the county Republicans are feeling good, too, their former county chair Scott Frostman told me, especially with Johnson leading Barnes by the Wisconsin-comfortable margin of six points in the latest Marquette poll. Frostman believes that, given the economy, Democrats don’t have much to run on, and he said people don’t bring up the abortion issue much when he knocks doors, albeit Republican and independent-leaning ones. Michels, meanwhile, had recently gotten the endorsement of the Tavern League, the trade group for bars around the state, which he’d accepted at a bar in Baraboo. Frostman, too, admits the elections will come down to turnout, and that there’s no real predicting what Wisconsin voters will do. He noted that, while Republican Governor Scott Walker ultimately lost to Evers by a narrow margin in 2018, the progressive Democrat Tammy Baldwin won her Senate race by a much larger margin that same year. “I’m like, how do you cast a vote for Scott Walker and then vote for Tammy Baldwin?” he said. “It’s a strange world, and this political stuff … it’s all strange.”\n \n  \n At the Downtowner bar in Baraboo — which, incidentally, was the first home of the Ringling Brothers Circus nearly a century and a half before this year’s political circus — Matt Schmidt said he leaned right but didn’t feel too strongly about it. He’s a musician and self-described “tawdry redneck,” and he was looking forward to an upcoming gig in the Wisconsin Dells and pretty happy with life in general. To the extent I could find a political consensus in close-split Sauk County, Schmidt summed it up the best of anyone. “If you’re on the extreme of either side,” he said, “you’re part of the fuckin’ problem.”","dc:creator":"Kathy Gilsinan","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/f0/fd/d0be8e6f4961ade31562fec8cb3b/lede.sauk.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Photographs by Andy Manis for POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Wisconsin voters watch a televised governor’s debate at the Sauk County Democratic Party headquarters in Baraboo, Wis., between incumbent Gov.

Having made Trump synonymous with lying, deceiving and bigotry, that job has been largely accomplished. But the political landscape can’t be remade by mere denormalizing. The most horrifying thing about Trump’s constant lies is not that he convinces his supporters to accept them but that his supporters don’t care that much about whether he’s telling the truth as they do about his positions or affectations about the culture war, race, immigration, abortion, grievance, police, trade, guns and political elites. Trump knows that when he stretches the facts, the press will call him out on it. But he also knows that his supporters will perceive his falsehoods as symbolic truths and cheer. The press should continue its lie-spotting because it’s our mission, but critics like Sullivan are wrong to expect such vigilance to change every mind.</p> <p>Sullivan correctly urges reporters to increase its coverage of “election deniers” who dishonestly preach about a “stolen” 2020 election.

She would prefer more “thoughtful framing and context” in coverage. Who can oppose that? Likewise, she counsels better quality control of headlines and news alerts to prevent the further dissemination of lies. Count me in. But her notions that the press should pay less attention to polls and staff blow-ups don’t reflect the way politics are waged. Polls drive fundraising and endorsements, both of which are key to winning votes which is the point of an election. To ignore them would be like ignoring the overture to a symphony. And a candidate’s ability to assemble a solid staff is a good stand-in for how they’ll perform in office.

Report on the party that has come to embody him. Talk with the people who vote for him. Explore the conditions of their lives. Dig into the issues that move them. Trace the lies that beguile them.” But isn’t that precisely what the press pack has been doing since Trump reentered campaigning?</p> <p>Packer adds a useful coverage suggestion in his kicker, writing that “when Trump says nothing new, ignore him.” But there’s evidence that the press is already doing so.

We were too soft on him in 2016, goes the drift. We handed a liar a megaphone and neglected to turn it off. We delighted in covering him because he delivered clicks. We failed to communicate how aberrant he was, thereby normalizing him. We let him blow through democratic norms.\n Such sentiments, expressed in full-throat by former Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan, but also echoed in part by pundit Bill Press, veteran journalist Marvin Kalb, journalist George Packer, and others, predictably comes paired with the advice that the “media” must radically rethink his coverage should he run again in 2024 as expected. The stories should highlight Trump’s mendacious, anti-democratic ways, and never amplify his lies. If we don’t reform our ways and he wins, we will be charged as accessories to democracy’s murder. Or something akin to that.\n But the notion that press “blunders” contributed to Trump’s victory — and that these blunders will elect him again unless the press corps corrects its ways — completely misreads 2016’s coverage. As I’ve written before, from the birth of his candidacy through Election Day, the press rode Trump like a donkey. In the opening weeks of his campaign, it reported and criticized Trump’s racist talk about Mexicans, recounted his status as a liar, billboarded his denigration of John McCain, corrected him when he blamed 9/11 on George W. Bush, charted his sleazy business practices, spelled out his policy ignorance, listed his flip-flops and recorded his misogynistic ways. No presidential candidate in memory outside of George Wallace received harsher coverage. If anything, the press denormalized Trump, rising to declare in unison in the summer of 2015 that the Trump campaign was not just grotesque but also toast.\n Despite this coruscating coverage, Trump polled at 30 percent going into the second Republican debate in mid-September 2015, an astonishing feat for a political newcomer in a field of 16. As the campaign progressed, the press poured more of the same on Trump — all deserved, mind you — uncovering his devious use of philanthropy, exposing his lies in fact-checking columns and shaming him for his Muslim-ban plan. Trump did find safe harbor at Fox News Channel and on Morning Joe, and the cable networks covered his rallies with real frequency. But the coverage reflected his status as the front-runner. By the time Trump had secured the nomination, he still commanded the airwaves over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But whose fault was that? Trump made himself available while Clinton consciously backed out of the TV spotlight, as the New York Times reported in a May 30, 2016 piece. Even so, the news about Trump was largely negative. The conservatives at the National Review published a special “Against Trump” issue in January 2016, and the Weekly Standard’s neocons took a similar anti-Trump slant. A full spectrum of the press warned us about who he was.\n \n \n Once Trump became president, his behavior didn’t change, nor did the critical coverage end. To those who say the press failed to properly call out Trump for his many lies, please consult the news clips. The press did refrain from calling Trump a liar for the first two years of his administration, but by June 2019 the press had overcome that reluctance, as the Washington Post’s Paul Farhi reported. “It’s (almost) official: The president of the United States is a liar,” Farhi wrote. “Nowadays, many in the news media are no longer bothering to grant Trump the benefit of the doubt. In routine news and feature stories, Trump’s dishonesty carries no fig leaf. It is described baldly.”\n Should the press have started calling Trump a liar earlier? Perhaps. I had no problem doing so in December 2015. But I wasn’t alone. The fact-checkers at FactCheck.org crowned Trump “The King of Whoppers’ the same month. PolitiFact awarded him “Lie of the Year” in 2015, 2017, and 2019. It’s worth mentioning that Trump’s capacity for lies increased as he settled into the White House, as the New Yorker’s Susan B. Glasser reported in August 2018: Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler logged 2,140 false claims by President Trump in his first year but twice as many (4,229) in the six months of 2018 leading up to Glasser’s piece. By 2018’s end, Trump had become recognized as such a profligate liar that Kessler had to devise a new unit of measurement to describe Trump’s insistence on repeated single falsehoods again and again. To the previous measure of lies on a one-to-four Pinocchio scale, Kessler instituted The Bottomless Pinocchio.\n Some critics insist that the press do more to denormalize candidates like Trump. Having made Trump synonymous with lying, deceiving and bigotry, that job has been largely accomplished. But the political landscape can’t be remade by mere denormalizing. The most horrifying thing about Trump’s constant lies is not that he convinces his supporters to accept them but that his supporters don’t care that much about whether he’s telling the truth as they do about his positions or affectations about the culture war, race, immigration, abortion, grievance, police, trade, guns and political elites. Trump knows that when he stretches the facts, the press will call him out on it. But he also knows that his supporters will perceive his falsehoods as symbolic truths and cheer. The press should continue its lie-spotting because it’s our mission, but critics like Sullivan are wrong to expect such vigilance to change every mind.\n Sullivan correctly urges reporters to increase its coverage of “election deniers” who dishonestly preach about a “stolen” 2020 election. But that’s just sending a telegram the press got long ago.

The same with the Washington Post. And the Los Angles Times. And the Wall Street Journal. It’s a great prescription but the patient has already taken the medicine.\n \n \n She makes other suggestions worthy of our consideration for how to cover a Trump 2024 bid. She would prefer more “thoughtful framing and context” in coverage. Who can oppose that? Likewise, she counsels better quality control of headlines and news alerts to prevent the further dissemination of lies. Count me in. But her notions that the press should pay less attention to polls and staff blow-ups don’t reflect the way politics are waged. Polls drive fundraising and endorsements, both of which are key to winning votes which is the point of an election. To ignore them would be like ignoring the overture to a symphony. And a candidate’s ability to assemble a solid staff is a good stand-in for how they’ll perform in office. The backstabbing that occurred in the Trump campaign only grew fiercer when he arrived in the White House. It’s not mere gossip.\n One critic of Trump coverage, the Atlantic’s George Packer, offers this suggestion for the media in 2024. “If Trump runs again, journalists would do better to follow the money that supports him. Report on the party that has come to embody him. Talk with the people who vote for him. Explore the conditions of their lives. Dig into the issues that move them. Trace the lies that beguile them.” But isn’t that precisely what the press pack has been doing since Trump reentered campaigning?\n Packer adds a useful coverage suggestion in his kicker, writing that “when Trump says nothing new, ignore him.” But there’s evidence that the press is already doing so. His spurious Truth Social posts don’t get picked up the way his tweets once did, but then again, he’s not president now. Even New York University press scholar Jay Rosen, who loudly disdains the conventions of political reporting concedes that covering somebody like Trump is “not as simple as ‘don’t amplify.’” He continues, “There are occasions when the public needs to know that a political figure is falsifying reality, or that a consequential lie is gaining traction, as with Stop the Steal.”\n None of this is to belittle those who implore the press to improve its game in 2024. As ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl put it succinctly last year, Trump presents unique challenges. “You’re covering essentially an anti-democratic candidate,” Karl said on Reliable Sources. “You’re covering somebody running in a system that is trying to undermine that very system.” But again, is there a newsroom in America that hasn’t internalized that lesson by now?\n \n \n Reporters and editors should never reflexively bat away criticism. If Trump runs again in 2024, which looks likely, they’ll need as many back-seat drivers as they can get. But a genuine reckoning on how to cover Trump in 2024 must take an accurate inventory of the way we’ve actually covered him.\n ******\n Send your favorite Trump lie to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"mailto:shafer.politico@gmail.com\",\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0a80000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0a80001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization</i>, critics have accused the justices who signed onto that ruling of ignoring the broad tradition of respect for precedent embodied in the principle of stare decisis.</p> <p>Kavanaugh and Barrett both joined Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion in <i>Dobbs</i> concluding that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> “was egregiously wrong from the start” so it didn't deserve to be kept on the books.</p> <p>Affirmative action opponents are seeking a similarly definitive repudiation of the precedents on that issue, but Kavanaugh and Barrett didn't seem to think that was called for in the cases over admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.</p> <p>“The recent <i>Dobbs</i> decision was in the air today, both when the counsels supporting affirmative action mentioned precedent and when the conservative justices noted that ending race-based admissions was in keeping with <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i>’s expectation that 25 years from now — from 2003 — the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,” said Curt Levey of the conservative legal group Committee for Justice.</p> <p>Indeed, Barrett and Kavanaugh focused Monday on applying precedent, not overturning it, arguing that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s unusual call two decades ago in <i>Grutter</i> for educational affirmative action to phase out in 25 years should be respected.</p> <p>“We’re not to that 25-year point yet, right?” Barrett said. “So, if it has its own self-destruct mechanism where it says like, ‘Hey, <i>Grutter</i> says we've got to call it quits because they're just not working,’ are we obligated to give more time?”</p> <p>“Justice O'Connor's majority opinion was concerned about indefinite extension. ... How will we know when the time has come?” Kavanaugh asked.</p> <p>When Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar pleaded with the justices not to disturb the existing precedents on affirmative language, she also didn’t mention the court’s impactful abortion ruling, but her carefully-chosen language echoed the debate over that decision.</p> <p>“I think the Court should not take the destabilizing step of overruling precedent here,” Prelogar told the justices. “It would have these destabilizing ramifications in just about every important industry in America.”</p> <p>In practical terms, the incrementalist approach Kavanaugh and Barrett signaled Monday may not give race-based admissions practices much more than a temporary reprieve. Kavanaugh even toyed with the notion that a decision issued by the high court next year could be seen as winding affirmative action down by O’Connor’s deadline since the crop of students admitted next fall will graduate in 2028.</p> <p>Another attorney who argued against the race-conscious admissions practices at the high court, Cameron Norris, urged a similar analysis. He said two decades of experimentation with such policies since <i>Grutter</i> have shown they aren’t phasing out on their own in the way O’Connor hoped.</p> <p>“I think 20 years is enough to call it,” Norris said.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"The Supreme Court grappled with affirmative action Monday, but the court’s summer ruling overturning the half-century old Roe v.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, critics have accused the justices who signed onto that ruling of ignoring the broad tradition of respect for precedent embodied in the principle of stare decisis.\n Kavanaugh and Barrett both joined Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion in Dobbs concluding that Roe v. Wade “was egregiously wrong from the start” so it didn't deserve to be kept on the books.\n Affirmative action opponents are seeking a similarly definitive repudiation of the precedents on that issue, but Kavanaugh and Barrett didn't seem to think that was called for in the cases over admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.\n “The recent Dobbs decision was in the air today, both when the counsels supporting affirmative action mentioned precedent and when the conservative justices noted that ending race-based admissions was in keeping with Grutter v. Bollinger’s expectation that 25 years from now — from 2003 — the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,” said Curt Levey of the conservative legal group Committee for Justice.\n Indeed, Barrett and Kavanaugh focused Monday on applying precedent, not overturning it, arguing that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s unusual call two decades ago in Grutter for educational affirmative action to phase out in 25 years should be respected.\n “We’re not to that 25-year point yet, right?” Barrett said. “So, if it has its own self-destruct mechanism where it says like, ‘Hey, Grutter says we've got to call it quits because they're just not working,’ are we obligated to give more time?”\n “Justice O'Connor's majority opinion was concerned about indefinite extension. ... How will we know when the time has come?” Kavanaugh asked.\n When Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar pleaded with the justices not to disturb the existing precedents on affirmative language, she also didn’t mention the court’s impactful abortion ruling, but her carefully-chosen language echoed the debate over that decision.\n “I think the Court should not take the destabilizing step of overruling precedent here,” Prelogar told the justices. “It would have these destabilizing ramifications in just about every important industry in America.”\n In practical terms, the incrementalist approach Kavanaugh and Barrett signaled Monday may not give race-based admissions practices much more than a temporary reprieve. Kavanaugh even toyed with the notion that a decision issued by the high court next year could be seen as winding affirmative action down by O’Connor’s deadline since the crop of students admitted next fall will graduate in 2028.\n Another attorney who argued against the race-conscious admissions practices at the high court, Cameron Norris, urged a similar analysis. He said two decades of experimentation with such policies since Grutter have shown they aren’t phasing out on their own in the way O’Connor hoped.\n “I think 20 years is enough to call it,” Norris said.","dc:creator":"Josh Gerstein","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/33/5c/e8c6ae5e4416ac9c538bd5784fb1/state-of-the-union-47479.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"J.

That can be advantageous to those concerned about the estate tax because those depressed values mean they can give away more without bumping into the estate tax limits.\n And that’s particularly valuable if the price of those stocks, for example, is likely to rebound later, after they’ve been given away, Roe said.\n “The stock market has not done very well, and depending on the type of asset you’re transferring, you could transfer a lot more than you could this time last year,” he said. “We have a window of opportunity here.”\n “There’s a saying in estate tax planning that you’re going to give your property to your family, to charity or to the Internal Revenue Service,” Roe added.","dc:creator":"Brian Faler","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/20/af/484b7c834e2dae80ccfe960e393c/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/174238946"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Win McNamee/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"The IRS has announced more than 60 inflation adjustments to the tax code, including boosts in everything from how much people can put in 401(k) retirement accounts to the earnings thresholds at which different tax brackets take effect.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/20/af/484b7c834e2dae80ccfe960e393c/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/174238946"}}]},"content":"Couples will be able to shelter an additional $1.7 million from the tax","contentSnippet":"Couples will be able to shelter an additional $1.7 million from the tax","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/inflation-estate-tax-for-wealthy-00064069","isoDate":"2022-11-01T08:30:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Steve Marble","title":"Paul Morantz dies; L.A. attorney nearly killed when cult planted rattlesnake in his mailbox","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-28/paul-morantz-dies-l-a-attorney-nearly-killed-when-cult-planted-rattlesnake-in-mailbox","pubDate":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 00:01:46 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Synanon leader Charles Dederich and two of his followers were sentenced for the snake attack, which came after Morantz prevailed against the group in court.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Synanon leader Charles Dederich and two of his followers were sentenced for the snake attack, which came after Morantz prevailed against the group in court.","dc:creator":"Steve Marble","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e64ad6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/730x487+0+0/resize/730x487!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd5%2Fbb%2F705053fe46df9972aa304cd87df5%2Fpaul-1.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"Paul Morantz at press conference following rattlesnake attack in 1978.","$":{"type":"plain"}}],"media:credit":[{"_":"Courtesy Chaz Morantz","$":{"role":"author","scheme":"urn:ebu"}}]},"content":"<p>Synanon leader Charles Dederich and two of his followers were sentenced for the snake attack, which came after Morantz prevailed against the group in court.</p>","contentSnippet":"Synanon leader Charles Dederich and two of his followers were sentenced for the snake attack, which came after Morantz prevailed against the group in court.","guid":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-28/paul-morantz-dies-l-a-attorney-nearly-killed-when-cult-planted-rattlesnake-in-mailbox","isoDate":"2022-10-29T00:01:46.000Z"},{"title":"20 carry-on essentials that will help you avoid checking a bag","link":"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/travel/carry-on-essentials-to-avoid-checked-bag?iid=CNNUnderscoredHPcontainer","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/travel/carry-on-essentials-to-avoid-checked-bag?iid=CNNUnderscoredHPcontainer"},{"creator":"Melanie Mason","title":"Democratic star Katie Porter fights against a conservative resurgence in O.C.","link":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-01/katie-porter-scott-baugh-california-congress-midterm-elections","pubDate":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 13:10:39 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Porter has money and fame, but Republican Scott Baugh is betting on Orange County's traditional conservatism to flip her House seat.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Porter has money and fame, but Republican Scott Baugh is betting on Orange County's traditional conservatism to flip her House seat.","dc:creator":"Melanie Mason","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65bd90b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5500x3829+0+0/resize/1500x1044!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2Fdb%2Ffc3fd2f9447abab5771f204a4653%2F1202036-me-rep-katie-porter-orange-county-01-mjc.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA - OCTOBER 17: Richard Bruck of Corona del Mar greets Rep.

Kathy Hochul's latest ad ends with her looking directly into the camera: \"You deserve to feel safe, and as your governor, I won’t stop working until you do.\"\n It's a message that Hochul has been taking to the streets of New York City in the final days of the gubernatorial campaign as she looks to boost turnout in the heavily Democratic city and beat back Republican opponent Lee Zeldin's claim she is soft on crime.\n Lawlessness has become the top issue in the last week of the campaign in what polls show is an unexpectedly close race for governor. Hochul is trying to become the state's first woman elected governor as Zeldin looks to be the first Republican elected statewide in 20 years.\n \"We have been on this issue from the very beginning. And if people think it doesn’t happen unless they see it in a television ad, we’ve had television ads on this back in May and June. So I think there needs to be some clarity,\" Hochul said of her closing message to voters.\n Republicans across the nation contend that Democrats haven't done enough to fight rising crime, and in New York, the debate is heightened by almost daily high-profile incidents in the city. Republicans have centered their attacks on the 2019 decision of New York lawmakers and then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo to end cash bail for most cases, which opponents said led to a revolving door of criminals headed back on the street.\n While state data has shown a low level of recidivism of those released, Zeldin has pointed to a number of cases where a person was released and then accused of committing new crimes. He’s vowed, if elected, to declare a crime emergency and suspend cashless bail.\n \"There is a crime emergency going on right now in this state, even though Kathy Hochul says there is nothing to see here, look away,\" Zeldin said Monday in Westchester at a rally with Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n \n \n Public polls have shown the race with Hochul in the lead by as little as 4 percentage points, according to Quinnipiac University, or by 11 points, according to Siena College — which had Hochul's lead at 17 points more than a month ago.\n Crime is at the top or near the top of issues that voters are focused on, the polls showed, and Hochul indicated in recent days that she needs to impress upon voters that she's been working on solutions since she took office when Cuomo resigned in August 2021.\n She fought to include tougher bail laws in the state budget in April, despite reluctance from the Democratic-led Legislature, and she called lawmakers back to Albany to toughen gun laws after a mass shooting in her hometown of Buffalo and after the Supreme Court tossed New York's century-old concealed carry laws.\n \"Unfortunately, through billionaire friends of Donald Trump, there has been millions and millions of dollars in dark money spent on independent expenditures to prop up the lie that somehow Lee Zeldin’s crime plan will be the solution. That is false,\" Hochul said Monday, referring to the $12 million that's come into two Zeldin super PACs largely funded by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder.\n Hochul has battled back with her own ads and is more recently getting an infusion of money from unions and other Democratic groups to boost her candidacy in the days before Election Day, Nov. 8.\n It's been a multi-pronged message from Democrats: Zeldin opposes abortion rights, has been an ardent Donald Trump supporter and doesn't back gun control that has been at the heart of Hochul's crime-fighting agenda. She's also criticizing Zeldin for saying in a CBS New York interview Sunday that he would support arming teachers in schools.\n \"What was the most appalling news to come out of this weekend was that Lee Zeldin not only support guns on subways and in places of worships and in our parks and in places like Times Square,\" Hochul said. \"He also now believes that the way to make your kids safer is to make sure that every classroom has a gun in it. Let that sink in.\"\n Amid concerns her campaign didn't make deep enough inroads with city Democrats, she stumped with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie in the Bronx on Tuesday, and was attending a Democratic gala with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Mayor Eric Adams later in the day.\n Zeldin on Tuesday will take his campaign to evening rallies in his hometown in Suffolk County and on Staten Island — two moderate areas that he would need to carry to pull an upset. In the city, Hochul is hoping for strong turnout that can overcome any close results in other parts of the state; Zeldin has talked about exceeding 30 percent of the vote in the city as a key to victory.\n \"Kathy Hochul says she doesn’t understand why it’s so important to me that we lock up criminals,\" Zeldin contended Monday, referring to Hochul's comments at last week's debate. \"And when she says that she doesn’t understand why this is so important to me, she’s saying she doesn’t understand why this is so important to you.\"","dc:creator":"Joseph Spector","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/4c/1b/ed3124ab41f984bccf9842d41854/ap22305005086996.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Yuki Iwamura/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Democratic Governor of New York Kathy Hochul talks to customers at Veselka, a Ukrainian restaurant in the East Village, Monday, Oct. 31, 2022, in New York.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/4c/1b/ed3124ab41f984bccf9842d41854/ap22305005086996.jpg"}}]},"content":"Lawlessness has emerged a top issue for voters as election day looms.","contentSnippet":"Lawlessness has emerged a top issue for voters as election day looms.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/hochul-nyc-crime-message-campaign-00064387","isoDate":"2022-11-01T20:41:18.000Z"},{"creator":"Joshua Zeitz","title":"Where Will This Political Violence Lead?

this is exactly who we are. Political violence is an endemic feature of American political history. It was foundational to the overthrow of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the maintenance of Jim Crow for decades after.</p> <p>But today’s events bear uncanny resemblance to an earlier decade — the 1850s, when Southern Democrats, the conservatives of their day, unleashed a torrent of violence against their opponents. It was a decade when an angry and entrenched minority used force to thwart the will of a growing majority, often with the knowing support and even participation of prominent elected officials.</p> <p>That’s the familiar part of the story. The less appreciated angle is how that growing majority eventually came to accept the proposition that force was a necessary part of politics.</p> <br> <p><br><b>The 1850s were a singularly violent era </b>in American politics. Though politicians both North and South, Whig and Democrat, tried to contain sectional differences over slavery, Southern Democrats and their Northern sympathizers increasingly pushed the envelope, employing coercion and violence to protect and spread the institution of slavery.</p> <p>It began with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which stripped accused runaways of their right to trial by jury and allowed individual cases to be bumped up from state courts to special federal courts. As an extra incentive to federal commissioners adjudicating such cases, it provided a $10 fee when a defendant was remanded to slavery but only $5 for a finding rendered against the slave owner. Most obnoxious to many Northerners, the law stipulated harsh fines and prison sentences for any citizen who refused to cooperate with or aid federal authorities in the capture of accused fugitives. Southern Democrats enforced the law with brute force, to the horror of Northerners, including many who did not identify as anti-slavery.</p> <p>The next provocation was the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854, which effectively abrogated the Missouri Compromise and opened the western territories to slavery. It wasn’t enough that Democrats rammed through legislation allowing the citizens of the Kansas and Nebraska territories to institutionalize slavery if they voted to do so in what had long been considered free territory. They then employed coercion and violence to rig the territorial elections that followed.</p> <p>Though anti-slavery residents far outnumbered pro-slavery residents in Kansas, heavily armed “Border ruffians,” led by Missouri’s Democratic senator David Atchison, stormed the Kansas territory by force, stuffing ballot boxes, assaulting and even killing Free State settlers, in a naked attempt to tilt the scales in favor of slavery. “You know how to protect your own interests,” Atchison cried. “Your rifles will free you from such neighbors. … You will go there, if necessary, with the bayonet and with blood.” He promised, “If we win, we can carry slavery to the Pacific Ocean.”</p> <p>The violence made it into Congress. When backlash against the Kansas Nebraska Act upended the political balance, driving anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs into the new, anti-slavery Republican party, pro-slavery Democrats responded with rage. In 1856, Charles Sumner, a staunch anti-slavery Republican, delivered a speech entitled “The Crime Against Kansas.” In response, a Democratic congressman from South Carolina beat him nearly to death on the Senate floor with a steel-tipped cane — not entirely dissimilar from the hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist who attempted to murder Paul Pelosi Friday.</p> <p>“Bleeding Sumner,” as the outrage came to be known, was not a one-off. Pro-slavery congressmen began showing up armed on the House floor. They threatened their Northern colleagues with whippings and beatings. They talked openly of civil war and rebellion.</p> <br> <p><br><b>In some ways, none of this was new.</b> Pro-slavery forces had long been violent and anti-democratic. When abolitionists in the 1830s began sending anti-slavery literature to Southern slaveholders, the pro-slavery forces tried to ban them from using the postal service. They destroyed the printing presses of abolitionist publishers and, in 1837, famously lynched Elijah P. Lovejoy, an abolitionist clergyman — after dumping his press in the river.</p> <p>But the 1850s were different — not just in the intensification of pro-slavery violence, but in the reaction it elicited.</p> <p>Southerners had long assumed that their Northern antagonists would buckle and fold. Anti-slavery men and women tended to draw their faith from evangelical Protestantism, which favored moral suasion over coercion. They were pacifists by nature. They seemed unlikely, when faced with threat and violence, to fight back.</p> <p>That was probably true in 1850. But by mid-decade, something changed.</p> <p>It probably began with the Fugitive Slave Act, which inspired resistance — increasingly, violent resistance — on the part of Northerners. When in 1852 President Franklin Pierce sent a battery of Army and Navy servicemen to seize Anthony Burns, a fugitive who had escaped to Boston, many former moderates found became angry, and radicalized. Amos Lawrence, a conservative businessman and politician, later attested, “We went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs &amp; waked up stark mad Abolitionists.”</p> <p>Armed anti-slavery mobs increasingly proved willing to engage in standoffs with federal officials. Outside Christiana, Pennsylvania, a Maryland slaveowner and his son, accompanied by armed marshals, showed up at a farmhouse and imperiously demanded the return of a Black man whom they claimed was their runaway slave. Local residents, Black and white alike, engaged in a gun fight with the “man stealers,” leaving one of them dead and two others wounded.</p> <p>Something changed in the tenor of anti-slavery rhetoric as well. Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person and lay preacher, declared that he was a “peace man,” but white men who willingly acted as “bloodhounds,” hunting down human beings to return them to slavery, had “no right to live.” “I do believe that two or three dead slaveholders will make this law a dead letter.” In a speech entitled “Is It Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?” Douglass conceded that perhaps it was not strategically smart, given the disbalance of power, but he affirmed that it “is in all cases, a crime to deprive a human being of life” and not a sin to kill those who would. “For a white man to defend his friend unto blood is praiseworthy,” Douglass wrote in 1854, “but for a Black man to do the same thing is crime. It was glorious for Patrick Henry to say, ‘Give me liberty or give me death!’ It was glorious for Americans to drench the soil, and crimson the sea with blood, to escape the payment of three-penny tax upon tea; but it is a crime to shoot down a monster in defense of the liberty of a Black man and to save him from bondage.”</p> <p>His was a minority opinion in the mid-1850s, but it was catching steam.</p> <p>A new generation of leaders welcomed an eye-for-an-eye approach to keeping the western territories free. Subsidized by a group of Massachusetts businessmen and religious abolitionists, the New England Emigrant Aid Company offered material assistance to Northern homesteaders willing to relocate to Kansas to populate the state with an anti-slavery majority. It also furnished them with rifles (known popularly as “Beecher’s Bibles,” an homage to Henry Ward Beecher, the prominent anti-slavery clergyman) and ammunition to help settlers stave off attacks by border ruffians who pillaged Free State property and rigged territorial elections. By 1857 the normalization of political violence advanced so far that when a prominent abolitionist urged the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to furnish material support for armed insurrections by enslaved people, even Wendell Phillips, a leading abolitionist and heretofore a pacifist, rose to agree. “I want to accustom Massachusetts to the idea of insurrection,” he said, “to the idea that every slave has the right to seize his freedom on the spot.”</p> <p>It was this embrace of retributive justice and support for violent liberation that led figures like Thomas Wentworth Higginson (a Unitarian minister), Gerrit Smith (a wealthy reformer and founder of a nonsectarian church in upstate New York), Theodore Parker (also a Unitarian clergyman), and Frederick Douglass to furnish John Brown with funds for his failed attempt to organize an uprising of enslaved people. Brown, a religious zealot who came to believe that he was God’s instrument in the service of emancipation, was widely scorned as a fanatic when in 1859 he was hanged for murder, incitement of an enslaved people’s rebellion, and “treason” against the state of Virginia. Within a few short years, many Union soldiers would come to memorialize him in song as they marched through the South.</p> <p>Members of Congress, too, tired of being under the Southern Democrats’ boot. When Galusha Grow, a Republican from Pennsylvania, wandered over to the Democratic side of the House floor in 1858, Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina snarled, “Go back to your side of the House, you Black Republican puppy.” Grow, a future House speaker, clocked Keitt with a right hook and sent him spinning.</p> <p>In 1860 Rep. Owen Lovejoy, a Republican from Illinois and brother of the slain editor, rose to deliver a blistering anti-slavery harangue. In response, Rep. Roger Pryor of Virginia physically assaulted him, prompting Rep. John Potter of Wisconsin to intercede. Potter so thoroughly walloped Pryor that the Virginian felt compelled to challenge him to a duel — a common ploy, as Northerners tended to view dueling as barbaric, and normally declined. Potter astonished his Southern colleague by accepting the challenge and stipulating (as was the right of the challenged party) bowie knives as his weapon of choice. Pryor, recognizing that he’d likely be hacked to death, backed out, claiming that knives were beneath the dignity of a gentleman’s duel. (Potter might well have taken his cue from Benjamin Wade, a radical Republican senator from Ohio who, when challenged to a duel by a Southern colleague, stipulated squirrel riffles at 20 paces.)</p> <p>Within a year, full-blown war had broken out.</p> <br> <p><br><b>Today, political violence is on the rise.</b> It doesn’t always emanate from the right. Several years ago, a left-wing radical attempted to gun down several Republican congressmen and nearly succeeded in killing GOP Whip Steve Scalise. But in the main, the coercion and bellicosity reside on the right. We see it in the rise of far-right, white power militias like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who in some cases enjoy <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/the-paul-pelosi-attack-is-a-harbinger-of-much-worse.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;semiformal relationships&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/the-paul-pelosi-attack-is-a-harbinger-of-much-worse.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0740011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0740012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">semiformal relationships</a> with local Republican Party organizations and leaders.

As recently as the early 1970s, bombings and sabotage were a common tool of far-left domestic terrorists. All told, between January 1969 and April 1970 there were over 5,000 terrorist bombings in the United States and 37,000 bomb threats, many emanating from the radical left, not including the attempted bombings of over two dozen high schools.</p> <p>But here is the difference this time: In 1970, liberal members of the Senate didn’t march alongside members of the Weather Underground, pump their fists in the air and egg them on. They didn’t align themselves with violent extremists — court their votes, grant interviews to their underground newspapers, appear at their conferences. That’s the stuff of the 1850s, when mainstream Democrats turned away from democracy and openly embraced violence, vigilantism and treason to protect a world they saw at risk of disappearing.</p> <p>The decision of so many American conservatives to embrace political violence, or the language and symbolism of political violence, is a troubling reality. We can’t have a functioning democracy if one side refuses to accept its norms and rules.</p> <p>But history suggests we might have more to worry about.</p> <p>Democratic violence in the 1850s ultimately led a majority of Republicans, who represented the political majority, to draw a line in the sand and enforce it by violence when necessary. If history is a guidepost, we are on the precipice of dangerous future in which politics devolves into a contest of force rather than ideas. That’s a future everyone should want to avoid.<br></p> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Early Friday morning, an intruder broke into the San Francisco home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and bludgeoned her husband, Paul Pelosi, 82, on the head with a hammer.\n Details are still scant, but early indications suggest that the suspect, David Depape, is an avid purveyor of anti-Semitic, QAnon and MAGA conspiracy theories.

They then employed coercion and violence to rig the territorial elections that followed.\n Though anti-slavery residents far outnumbered pro-slavery residents in Kansas, heavily armed “Border ruffians,” led by Missouri’s Democratic senator David Atchison, stormed the Kansas territory by force, stuffing ballot boxes, assaulting and even killing Free State settlers, in a naked attempt to tilt the scales in favor of slavery. “You know how to protect your own interests,” Atchison cried. “Your rifles will free you from such neighbors. … You will go there, if necessary, with the bayonet and with blood.” He promised, “If we win, we can carry slavery to the Pacific Ocean.”\n The violence made it into Congress. When backlash against the Kansas Nebraska Act upended the political balance, driving anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs into the new, anti-slavery Republican party, pro-slavery Democrats responded with rage. In 1856, Charles Sumner, a staunch anti-slavery Republican, delivered a speech entitled “The Crime Against Kansas.” In response, a Democratic congressman from South Carolina beat him nearly to death on the Senate floor with a steel-tipped cane — not entirely dissimilar from the hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist who attempted to murder Paul Pelosi Friday.\n “Bleeding Sumner,” as the outrage came to be known, was not a one-off. Pro-slavery congressmen began showing up armed on the House floor. They threatened their Northern colleagues with whippings and beatings. They talked openly of civil war and rebellion.\n  \nIn some ways, none of this was new. Pro-slavery forces had long been violent and anti-democratic. When abolitionists in the 1830s began sending anti-slavery literature to Southern slaveholders, the pro-slavery forces tried to ban them from using the postal service. They destroyed the printing presses of abolitionist publishers and, in 1837, famously lynched Elijah P. Lovejoy, an abolitionist clergyman — after dumping his press in the river.\n But the 1850s were different — not just in the intensification of pro-slavery violence, but in the reaction it elicited.\n Southerners had long assumed that their Northern antagonists would buckle and fold. Anti-slavery men and women tended to draw their faith from evangelical Protestantism, which favored moral suasion over coercion. They were pacifists by nature. They seemed unlikely, when faced with threat and violence, to fight back.\n That was probably true in 1850. But by mid-decade, something changed.\n It probably began with the Fugitive Slave Act, which inspired resistance — increasingly, violent resistance — on the part of Northerners. When in 1852 President Franklin Pierce sent a battery of Army and Navy servicemen to seize Anthony Burns, a fugitive who had escaped to Boston, many former moderates found became angry, and radicalized. Amos Lawrence, a conservative businessman and politician, later attested, “We went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs & waked up stark mad Abolitionists.”\n Armed anti-slavery mobs increasingly proved willing to engage in standoffs with federal officials. Outside Christiana, Pennsylvania, a Maryland slaveowner and his son, accompanied by armed marshals, showed up at a farmhouse and imperiously demanded the return of a Black man whom they claimed was their runaway slave. Local residents, Black and white alike, engaged in a gun fight with the “man stealers,” leaving one of them dead and two others wounded.\n Something changed in the tenor of anti-slavery rhetoric as well. Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person and lay preacher, declared that he was a “peace man,” but white men who willingly acted as “bloodhounds,” hunting down human beings to return them to slavery, had “no right to live.” “I do believe that two or three dead slaveholders will make this law a dead letter.” In a speech entitled “Is It Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?” Douglass conceded that perhaps it was not strategically smart, given the disbalance of power, but he affirmed that it “is in all cases, a crime to deprive a human being of life” and not a sin to kill those who would. “For a white man to defend his friend unto blood is praiseworthy,” Douglass wrote in 1854, “but for a Black man to do the same thing is crime. It was glorious for Patrick Henry to say, ‘Give me liberty or give me death!’ It was glorious for Americans to drench the soil, and crimson the sea with blood, to escape the payment of three-penny tax upon tea; but it is a crime to shoot down a monster in defense of the liberty of a Black man and to save him from bondage.”\n His was a minority opinion in the mid-1850s, but it was catching steam.\n A new generation of leaders welcomed an eye-for-an-eye approach to keeping the western territories free. Subsidized by a group of Massachusetts businessmen and religious abolitionists, the New England Emigrant Aid Company offered material assistance to Northern homesteaders willing to relocate to Kansas to populate the state with an anti-slavery majority. It also furnished them with rifles (known popularly as “Beecher’s Bibles,” an homage to Henry Ward Beecher, the prominent anti-slavery clergyman) and ammunition to help settlers stave off attacks by border ruffians who pillaged Free State property and rigged territorial elections. By 1857 the normalization of political violence advanced so far that when a prominent abolitionist urged the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to furnish material support for armed insurrections by enslaved people, even Wendell Phillips, a leading abolitionist and heretofore a pacifist, rose to agree. “I want to accustom Massachusetts to the idea of insurrection,” he said, “to the idea that every slave has the right to seize his freedom on the spot.”\n It was this embrace of retributive justice and support for violent liberation that led figures like Thomas Wentworth Higginson (a Unitarian minister), Gerrit Smith (a wealthy reformer and founder of a nonsectarian church in upstate New York), Theodore Parker (also a Unitarian clergyman), and Frederick Douglass to furnish John Brown with funds for his failed attempt to organize an uprising of enslaved people. Brown, a religious zealot who came to believe that he was God’s instrument in the service of emancipation, was widely scorned as a fanatic when in 1859 he was hanged for murder, incitement of an enslaved people’s rebellion, and “treason” against the state of Virginia. Within a few short years, many Union soldiers would come to memorialize him in song as they marched through the South.\n Members of Congress, too, tired of being under the Southern Democrats’ boot. When Galusha Grow, a Republican from Pennsylvania, wandered over to the Democratic side of the House floor in 1858, Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina snarled, “Go back to your side of the House, you Black Republican puppy.” Grow, a future House speaker, clocked Keitt with a right hook and sent him spinning.\n In 1860 Rep. Owen Lovejoy, a Republican from Illinois and brother of the slain editor, rose to deliver a blistering anti-slavery harangue. In response, Rep. Roger Pryor of Virginia physically assaulted him, prompting Rep. John Potter of Wisconsin to intercede. Potter so thoroughly walloped Pryor that the Virginian felt compelled to challenge him to a duel — a common ploy, as Northerners tended to view dueling as barbaric, and normally declined. Potter astonished his Southern colleague by accepting the challenge and stipulating (as was the right of the challenged party) bowie knives as his weapon of choice. Pryor, recognizing that he’d likely be hacked to death, backed out, claiming that knives were beneath the dignity of a gentleman’s duel. (Potter might well have taken his cue from Benjamin Wade, a radical Republican senator from Ohio who, when challenged to a duel by a Southern colleague, stipulated squirrel riffles at 20 paces.)\n Within a year, full-blown war had broken out.\n  \nToday, political violence is on the rise. It doesn’t always emanate from the right. Several years ago, a left-wing radical attempted to gun down several Republican congressmen and nearly succeeded in killing GOP Whip Steve Scalise. But in the main, the coercion and bellicosity reside on the right. We see it in the rise of far-right, white power militias like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who in some cases enjoy semiformal relationships with local Republican Party organizations and leaders. We see it in MAGA rallies, where former President Donald Trump regularly incites violence against journalists and political opponents, oftentimes with GOP officeholders and candidates standing silently beside him. We see it in the growing number of political ads in which Republican candidates brandish assault weapons and even shoot things up.\n On some level, none of this is new. The United States has seen more than its share of political violence — from Redemption (the process by which white Southerners violently ended Reconstruction in the South) and Jim Crow, to presidential assassinations in 1865, 1881, 1901 and 1963. As recently as the early 1970s, bombings and sabotage were a common tool of far-left domestic terrorists. All told, between January 1969 and April 1970 there were over 5,000 terrorist bombings in the United States and 37,000 bomb threats, many emanating from the radical left, not including the attempted bombings of over two dozen high schools.\n But here is the difference this time: In 1970, liberal members of the Senate didn’t march alongside members of the Weather Underground, pump their fists in the air and egg them on. They didn’t align themselves with violent extremists — court their votes, grant interviews to their underground newspapers, appear at their conferences. That’s the stuff of the 1850s, when mainstream Democrats turned away from democracy and openly embraced violence, vigilantism and treason to protect a world they saw at risk of disappearing.\n The decision of so many American conservatives to embrace political violence, or the language and symbolism of political violence, is a troubling reality. We can’t have a functioning democracy if one side refuses to accept its norms and rules.\n But history suggests we might have more to worry about.\n Democratic violence in the 1850s ultimately led a majority of Republicans, who represented the political majority, to draw a line in the sand and enforce it by violence when necessary. If history is a guidepost, we are on the precipice of dangerous future in which politics devolves into a contest of force rather than ideas. That’s a future everyone should want to avoid.","dc:creator":"Joshua Zeitz","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/fd/86/066d6f6a4280a229ff2f81a54128/640px-quantrills-raid-in-lawrence-kansas2.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Wikimedia Commons","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"The destruction of the city of Lawrence, Kansas, and the massacre of its inhabitants by the Rebel guerrillas, August 21, 1863.

But America First Legal, launched by longtime Donald Trump aide Stephen Miller, has plastered airwaves and mailboxes with the issue ahead of the election — all without mentioning candidates currently running for office, as both groups are registered nonprofits.\n Ads targeting transgender children have spread in at least 25 states across the political spectrum — from Texas to Illinois to Michigan — in the last month, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\n America First Legal has made more than $4 million in radio buys across Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Detroit — cities in competitive states with significant Black populations. The radio ad features a man speaking over ominous music, claiming that children have been pushed to take puberty blockers and get gender-affirming surgery.\n “The Biden administration is pushing radical gender experiments on children,” the narrator says in the original radio spot. “Tell Joe Biden and left-wing leaders across America, ‘Hands off our kids.’”\n NAACP president Derrick Johnson said the organization sent letters to radio stations asking them not to run the ad, which he called “the worst I’ve seen” on the issue this cycle.\n \n \n “This is playing to the lowest common denominator of hate and otherizing, targeting the LGBT community,” Johnson said. “When you create this type of negative reaction to individuals who [don’t] present any societal grief, you only create space for people to feel justified for attacking them physically and through public policy.”\n Geoff Wetrosky, the Human Rights Campaign’s national campaign director, said the ads are an effort to suppress turnout.\n “If they were looking to motivate voters to get to the polls and support particular candidates, I don't think it would be using the particular language and messaging that they're using,” he said. “It's meant to fly under the radar as much as possible. Voter suppression efforts are typically done at the last minute and behind the scenes.”\n America First Legal vice president and general counsel Gene Hamilton defended the radio ad. “The Biden Administration and its allies are advancing a radical agenda that denies biology, denies reality, and denies that they are threatening children,” he said in a statement. “We believe in biology and we believe that confused children should not be harmed permanently by individuals with radical agendas.”\n America First Legal has also sent mailers to Black and Hispanic households in states including Georgia, Texas and Nevada, according to advertisements collected as part of POLITICO’s Political Mailers Project. Citizens for Sanity, another group formed by Trump administration alumni which has spent tens of millions on late advertising, also made TV buys on the issue a week ahead of Election Day in battleground states including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n In Spanish and English-language mailers, America First Legal similarly warned against “radical and irreversible gender experiments,\" including anecdotes from unnamed people who regretted “destroying their lives” with gender-affirming care and surgery. Another ad more specifically goes after Biden, surrounding a picture of the president with anti-transgender headlines related to schools from Fox News and the Daily Wire.\n \n  \n Medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, support gender-affirming care for adolescents. But medical experts said gender-affirming care for children rarely, if ever, includes surgery. Instead, doctors are more likely to recommend counseling, social transitioning and hormone replacement therapy.\n LGBTQ people of color, especially Black people, face heightened levels of discrimination leading to high unemployment rates and homelessness, according to a recent report from the National LGBTQ Task Force.\n Wetrosky noted that organizations made similar efforts to create divisions between LGBTQ individuals and Black and Latino voters when campaigning against marriage equality a decade ago.\n “This is not a new playbook. It's just a new chapter and an unfortunate playbook that we think is outdated. And it didn't work for marriage,” he said.\n America First Legal also stoked claims of “anti-white bigotry” in another radio ad spread earlier in October and has sent political mailers claiming the president has engaged in racial discrimination against white and Asian Americans.\n Miller launched America First Legal to be a “conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union.” It has taken part in lawsuits and other legal action concerning instruction about racism in public schools, voting, LGBTQ and immigration policies, as well as claiming Biden’s administration is “anti-white.”\n Advertising focused on transgender children has popped up in several states this year, though America First Legal and Citizens for Sanity have been by far the biggest actors on the issue. In Kansas, the Republican Governors Association has gone after Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on youth sports policy.\n “Laura Kelly says she’s middle of the road,” a spot from earlier this month says (the rest of the ad focuses on her crime policies). “But she’s not middle of the road on the transgender agenda.”\n \n \n The criticism stems from Kelly’s veto of two bills that would block transgender athletes from playing on public schools’ athletic teams designated for girls or women. Republican gubernatorial candidate Derek Schmidt has indicated that he would pass such legislation should he become governor. But most of his broadcast ads primarily pushed messaging about inflation.\n Another RGA ad featured Riley Gaines — a former University of Kentucky swimmer who has spoken out against former University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete on the school’s women’s team, after they competed in the NCAA championship earlier this year. In the ad, Gaines criticized Kelly’s veto, saying, “If Laura Kelly can’t protect women, she shouldn’t be governor of Kansas.”\n Kelly responded with her own spot, saying, “You may have seen my opponent's attacks, so let me just say it. Of course men should not play girls sports. Okay, we all agree there. Now, here's where Derek Schmidt and I disagree.”\n Transgender-focused ads have cropped up in other races on TV, although the volume pales in comparison to spots about economy and crime.

Democrats have slight leads in Arizona and Pennsylvania — though there’s a lack of reliable polling since last week’s potentially game-changing debate in that race.\n Monday’s New York Times/Siena College polls were each at least five days old when they were released, so even though Democrat John Fetterman was ahead Republican Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, it’s not clear if Fetterman’s lead endured after he stumbled though many of his answers at the debate.\n The new polls released so far this week did represent some of the first independent polling in days — and they interrupted a steady stream of publicly released surveys from Republican outlets, most of which contained more favorable results for the GOP.\n \n \n Taken together, the new polls suggest neither party has a commanding advantage in the battle for the chamber. Republicans need to net one seat to win back control of the Senate — and while POLITICO’s Election Forecast currently classifies five seats as “Toss Ups,” two are currently held by Republicans.\n Here are five takeaways from the newest polling data:\n Democrats lead in Arizona and Pennsylvania\n Among Democrats, the best news in the New York Times/Siena College polls came for Sen. Mark Kelly, who has seen his race in Arizona tighten considerably over the past few weeks.\n Not only does Kelly lead Republican Blake Masters by 6 points in the poll, he’s at 51 percent, just clear of the all-important majority mark for an incumbent to feel more secure. And he has a massive, 22-point advantage among registered independents, 58 percent to 36 percent.\n But one poll doesn’t mean Kelly is all of a sudden safe. A second survey out on Monday, from the in-state firm OH Predictive Insights, gave the Democrat an insignificant, 2-point lead.\n \n Fetterman, meanwhile, also posted a 6-point lead in the New York Times/Siena College poll. But his position is more precarious.\n Most of the poll’s interviews were conducted before last Tuesday’s debate. And though the Times did not publish precise numbers, its story noted that Fetterman’s lead shrunk in the interviews conducted last Wednesday, the day after the Fetterman-Oz debate.\n A Georgia runoff looms\n Monday also brought two new polls in Georgia, both of which pointed to the possibility — or likelihood — of a December runoff.\n Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock led Republican Herschel Walker in the New York Times/Siena College poll, 49 percent to 46 percent. That puts Warnock just shy of the majority needed to win outright.\n But the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s final poll showed Walker a point ahead of Warnock, 46 percent to 45 percent, with both men well below 50 percent.\n Notably, the Journal-Constitution’s poll included Libertarian Chase Oliver as a named option for respondents. He got 5 percent support in the survey — a vote share that easily could hold the leader under 50 percent in a tight race.\n But the New York Times survey didn’t mention Oliver — respondents had to volunteer they would vote for him. That led Oliver to capture only 1 percent of the vote in that survey, which helped Warnock approach a majority.\n Both approaches have their virtues. Oliver is actually on the ballot. But, historically, polls have overstated support for third-party candidates when they’ve been named options.\n Either way, given the close race between Warnock and Walker, Oliver’s eventual vote share could drag the race into overtime.\n \n  \n The Nevada tie\n Nevada is knotted up. \n Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt were tied in the New York Times/Siena College poll, 47 percent to 47 percent. Another new poll out Monday, an OH Predictive Insights poll conducted for the nonprofit Nevada Independent, showed Cortez Masto barely ahead of Laxalt, 43 percent to 41 percent.\n Again, though both polls point to a close race, the differences in vote share can be explained by different methodological choices. The Independent’s poll included all three third-party candidates, plus Nevada’s unique “none of these candidates” ballot option.\n But the Times poll required respondents to volunteer the names of the third-party candidates, and “none of these candidates,” likely leading to higher vote shares for both major-party hopefuls.\n Defying political gravity\n Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about Democrats' strong numbers in the New York Times/Siena College polls is how far ahead of President Joe Biden's approval rating they're running.\n Biden's approval rating in Arizona, according to the poll, is just 36 percent — a full 15 points behind Kelly's vote share. Warnock is 10 points ahead of Biden's pace in Georgia, Cortez Masto is 9 points ahead in Nevada and Fetterman's share is 7 points in front of Biden in Pennsylvania.\n For much of the year, both parties have been waiting for Democratic candidates' vote share and Biden's approval rating to converge. That's more likely to happen in House races, where the environment plays a bigger role and the less well-funded candidates themselves have less of an impact.\n If Kelly and Warnock survive next week, it will likely be a product of the durable profiles they've built, buoyed by their extravagant fundraising. And if they lose? It will be because political gravity, and the drag of Biden's poor approval ratings, caught up to them.\n \n Partisan Pollapalooza\n The flood of independent, nonpartisan polling on Monday prompted a popular question from some Democrats: What took so long?\n For the past week or so, polling averages like RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have seen a steady stream of surveys from Republican (or Republican-leaning firms). That’s led to a social-media debate over whether the GOP’s uptick in the polls is real — or whether it’s an artifact of which polls are comprising these averages.\n How much of an influence are the Republican polls having? In New Hampshire, four of the last seven polls in the FiveThirtyEight average are from Republican firms. In Pennsylvania, it’s the three most recent polls, and six of the last nine. In Georgia, five of the last seven.\n Some Democrats have fretted that Republican firms are deliberately flooding the zone for the purpose of affecting these polling averages — and the subsequent news coverage that comes with apparent momentum. Simon Rosenberg, a strategist whom POLITICO West Wing Playbook called “the most optimistic Dem online” this summer, appeared on MSNBC Monday night to call polling averages “effectively Republican propaganda” because the GOP is gaming them.\n There’s no evidence, however, that it’s a deliberate strategy to boost Republican chances in next week’s elections.\n But there’s another side to the influx of Republican polls — the dearth of public, independent surveys.\n Many of the news outlets responsible for large volumes of midterm polling four years ago are sitting on the sidelines this cycle.

He had retired after the 1956 season but was still hugely popular, having broken baseball’s color barrier 13 years earlier. And he had a decision to make: Who was he going to back in the presidential election that fall?</p> <p>Robinson’s endorsement was so valuable that both John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon personally courted him. And in turn, the baseball icon vetted each candidate, hard. As the election approached, he met with both men on the same day, a kind of job interview for his support.</p> <p>Robinson was an active supporter of the civil rights movement, and most Black Americans backed Kennedy. But Robinson had signaled early in 1960 that Democrats shouldn’t take Blacks’ support for granted. While his first choice for president had been a Democrat, civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey, Robinson made it clear that he was intrigued by Nixon as well.</p> <p>“Though the Democratic nominee is still undetermined at this point, it would be folly to underestimate the impression Nixon’s generally good civil rights record has made among Negroes,” Robinson wrote in a column published in the <i>Chicago Defender</i>, a Black newspaper, in January 1960. “I’ve been following Nixon’s career for some time now, and I don’t mind admitting that generally I’ve liked what I’ve seen and heard.”</p> <p>Robinson added that while Nixon’s record wasn’t as good as Humphrey’s, it was still “very attractive” compared to other Democratic candidates. “Many people whom I’ve talked with, whose first concern is civil rights, would not hesitate to support Vice President Nixon.”</p> <p>Robinson recognized that liberals disliked Nixon for how he had trashed his Democratic opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in his victorious 1950 Senate election. And, as he acknowledged in his autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>I Never Had It Made</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>I Never Had It Made</i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>“there was a great deal of suspicion in the black community about Nixon.” But he defended the vice president, writing that “in the years he’s been prominent in national affairs, Mr. Nixon has grown more than any other person presently in political life.”</p> <p>At the time, the parties were not as ideologically uniform as they are today — there were liberal Republicans and Democratic segregationists. And Robinson wasn’t ready to commit to Democrats if they didn’t nominate Humphrey, which they didn’t, leaving Robinson with a tough choice: Pick an untested Democrat or openly flout the preference of the Black community and support the Republican.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/0f/04/dba78e5a4a51aab785da8e16acf5/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>So, a few weeks before the mid-July Democratic National Convention, Robinson had his doubleheader of meetings with Nixon and Kennedy.</p> <p>In Nixon’s office, the vice president “said all the right things,” Robinson recalled in his autobiography. However, he was put off when he heard Nixon take a call and say, “No, well, I can’t do that. I’m tired of pulling his chestnuts out of this fire. He’ll have to work his own way out of this one.” After hanging up, Nixon told Robinson he had been talking about President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “It sounded as if the Vice President wanted me to disassociate him from Eisenhower since he knew that blacks, in the main, didn’t like Ike,” Robinson wrote. “It had the feel of a cheap trick.”</p> <p>But he had a much worse impression of Kennedy, whom he met with at a private home in Washington later that day.</p> <p>“My very first reaction to the Senator was one of doubt because he couldn’t or wouldn’t look me straight in the eye,” Robinson recalled, and he wound up writing a letter to JFK suggesting he do so in the future.</p> <p>“My second reaction, much more substantial, was that this was a man who had served in the Senate and wanted to be President but who knew little or nothing about black problems and sensibilities. He himself admitted a lack of any depth of understanding about black people … I was appalled that he could be so ignorant of our situation and be bidding for the highest office in the land.”</p> <p>That did it. Jackie Robinson chose Richard Nixon.<br></p> <br> <p>He told the leaders at Washington’s African Methodist Church that he asked the same questions of both candidates, and while Nixon gave straightforward answers, “I had to challenge Kennedy six times.”</p> <p>Robinson’s decision to support Nixon was controversial. It earned him the enmity of some Black leaders, including Malcolm X, but Robinson didn’t waver. Later, he would even support another Republican for president, moderate Nelson Rockefeller.</p> <p>“That was a pretty gutsy thing for him to do, considering the entire black establishment was behind John F. Kennedy, but Jackie Robinson had unique experience in breaking through in the white world,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;recalled William Safire&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">recalled William Safire</a>, a young Nixon aide at the time. “The athlete with the greatest positive influence on black-white relations since the boxer Joe Louis was not the sort to flinch at being called an Uncle Tom for supporting a Republican.”</p> <p>It was also a decision Robinson came to regret.</p> <p>In the coming years, he became disillusioned not just with Nixon, but with the Republican Party. The GOP had moved steadily to the right through the turbulent 1960s, embracing a strategy of pandering to Southern whites that threatened civil rights gains spearheaded by the Democrats. When Nixon sought the presidency again eight years later, Robinson denounced him in a column headlined, “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America.” Robinson would die in 1972, half a century before the reactionary forces he saw emerging ultimately came to dominate the GOP.<br></p> <br> <p><b>The relationship</b> between Nixon and Robinson dated back to 1952, when Robinson was a star player in his prime and Nixon was a U.S. senator running as Eisenhower’s vice presidential running mate, on their way to winning the White House.</p> <p>Nixon was a huge sports fan and something of a fanboy, and had a hard time curbing his enthusiasm when he met Robinson at that year’s Republican National Convention in Chicago. <a href=\"https://books.google.com.ai/books?id=ym0IFRp5F84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;According to Harrison McCall&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://books.google.com.ai/books?id=ym0IFRp5F84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">According to Harrison McCall</a>, president of the California Republican Assembly, who introduced the two men, Nixon told Robinson about first seeing him compete in a UCLA football game in 1939 — and about a specific play that stood out all these years later.</p> <p>“I said to Nixon as we walked away that, while Robinson had undoubtedly met a lot of notables in his career, nevertheless I was sure there was one person he would never forget,” McCall said.</p> <p>Nixon also watched Robinson play for the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field, including the World Series that fall, which the New York Yankees won in seven games. The two men were around the same age — Nixon was born six years earlier, in 1913 — and they both grew up in California, although under far different circumstances.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/e9/9a/355b4ca64360b5f1655d69bd4e2d/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>By 1957, a year after Robinson retired, he was praising Nixon for a speech in Ethiopia in which the vice president declared that the U.S. will never be satisfied until all Americans have equal opportunity. “In this endeavor,” Robinson wrote in one of many letters to Nixon, “you have my best wishes and steadfast cooperation.”</p> <p>“Dear Jackie,” Nixon replied. “As you can imagine, there were a number of letters on my desk when I returned to the office today after an absence of three weeks. I can assure you, however, that there were none which meant more to me than your thoughtful letter of March 19.” He called it a “privilege” to be working with Robinson “to achieve the important objective of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all Americans, and your expression of approval will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to me.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>So Nixon had built up</b> a groundswell of goodwill with Robinson in the years leading up to the 1960 election. But he soon squandered it.</p> <p>A key incident took place in October 1960, when Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed in Georgia. Nixon sat on his hands while the Kennedy campaign acted decisively. JFK called King’s wife, Coretta, to express support, and worked behind the scenes to press for King’s release. After he was freed, King publicly thanked JFK for his role and pointedly said he hadn’t heard from Nixon.</p> <p>At the Nixon campaign, Robinson had pushed for a robust response from his candidate.</p> <p>“He has to do this,” Robinson said at the time, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;1987 Safire column&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/opinion/essay-view-from-the-grandstand.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0820000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0820001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">1987 Safire column</a> in the <i>New York Times</i>. “He has to call Martin right now, today. I have the number of the jail.” Safire said he brought Robinson to the campaign manager, who then escorted him to see Nixon.</p> <p>“Ten minutes later, he came out, tears of frustration in his eyes,” Safire wrote. “‘He thinks calling Martin would be ‘grandstanding,’ Robinson reported. ‘Nixon doesn't deserve to win.’”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2e/1e/da486c2d46e5b02ad758943af421/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary4.png\"> <br> <p>In his autobiography, Robinson recalled: “I was in the behind-the-scenes struggle to persuade Dick Nixon to express his concern for Dr. King, but apparently his most trusted advisors were counseling him not to rock the racial boat. Add to this fact that Mr. Nixon refused to campaign in Harlem as his opponent did, and it is easy to understand why blacks overwhelmingly voted for Kennedy.”</p> <p>Despite his anger with Nixon, Robinson resisted entreaties from his wife and friends to switch sides.</p> <p>“It’s hard to explain why I stuck, disillusioned as I was,” he wrote. “It had something to do with stubbornness about continuing to want to believe in people even when everything indicates that they are no longer worthy of support.” He said he clung to the hope that Nixon would follow through on what he said at their meeting once the pressure of the campaign was over.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Nixon lost</b> and Robinson began to warm to President Kennedy after initially calling him out for a lack of progress on civil rights. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Robinson still supported a Republican, albeit a moderate one, for president in 1964 — Rockefeller, the New York governor — but this time with his eyes a bit more open.</p> <p>“I wasn’t about to be taken in instantly by the Nelson Rockefeller charm,” Robinson said. “After all, Richard Nixon had turned the charm on me too (although his is a bit more brittle compared with Rockefeller’s) and look how that had worked out.”</p> <p>And Robinson made a distinction between Rockefeller and the rest of the GOP: “I was not as sold on the Republican party as I was on the governor. Every chance I got, while I was campaigning, I said plainly what I thought of the right-wing Republicans and the harm they were doing.”</p> <p>Around this time, Robinson was also calling out Black militants such as Malcolm X, including in a November 1963 <i>Chicago Defender</i> column. Malcolm X replied in a Dec. 7 column in the same publication, addressed to “Dear Good Friend, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson”:</p> <p><i>Aren’t you the same ex-baseball player who tried to “mislead” Negroes in Nixon’s camp during the last presidential election? Evidently, you were the only Negro who voted for Nixon, because according to the polls taken afterward, very few Negroes were dumb enough to follow your “mislead.” … You never give up. You are now trying to lead Negroes into Nelson Rockefeller’s camp.</i></p> <p>Robinson went to the ’64 Republican National Convention in San Francisco as a special delegate, which he called “one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life.” Those were particularly striking words from a man who had endured death threats, hate mail and other abuse after debuting with the Dodgers in 1947.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/6c/86/5e206af94660bcf7b7563ce3d720/mag.Frommer.RobinsonNixon-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>“A new breed of Republican had taken over the GOP,” he wrote. “As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco, I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.”</p> <p>When he cheered on his candidate — shouting “‘C’mon, Rocky!’” — an angry Alabama delegate turned “menacingly” toward him, but the man’s wife held him back. Robinson, who early in his career was forced to turn the other check in the face of white infielders spiking him and white pitchers throwing at his head, had no such restraints now: “‘Turn him loose, lady, turn him loose!’ I shouted. I was ready for him. I wanted him badly, but luckily for him he obeyed his wife.”</p> <p>The Republicans nominated archconservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He’d also written off the Black vote, saying, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.” Robinson denounced him as a bigot and joined “Republicans for Johnson” — working to reelect Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who won in a landslide.<br></p> <br> <p><b>In 1966, Robinson went to work</b> for Rockefeller as a special assistant to the governor for community affairs, then backed him again in the 1968 presidential election, when Nixon staged a comeback.

He had retired after the 1956 season but was still hugely popular, having broken baseball’s color barrier 13 years earlier. And he had a decision to make: Who was he going to back in the presidential election that fall?\n Robinson’s endorsement was so valuable that both John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon personally courted him. And in turn, the baseball icon vetted each candidate, hard. As the election approached, he met with both men on the same day, a kind of job interview for his support.\n Robinson was an active supporter of the civil rights movement, and most Black Americans backed Kennedy. But Robinson had signaled early in 1960 that Democrats shouldn’t take Blacks’ support for granted. While his first choice for president had been a Democrat, civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey, Robinson made it clear that he was intrigued by Nixon as well.\n “Though the Democratic nominee is still undetermined at this point, it would be folly to underestimate the impression Nixon’s generally good civil rights record has made among Negroes,” Robinson wrote in a column published in the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper, in January 1960. “I’ve been following Nixon’s career for some time now, and I don’t mind admitting that generally I’ve liked what I’ve seen and heard.”\n Robinson added that while Nixon’s record wasn’t as good as Humphrey’s, it was still “very attractive” compared to other Democratic candidates. “Many people whom I’ve talked with, whose first concern is civil rights, would not hesitate to support Vice President Nixon.”\n Robinson recognized that liberals disliked Nixon for how he had trashed his Democratic opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas, in his victorious 1950 Senate election. And, as he acknowledged in his autobiography, I Never Had It Made\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Had-Made-Autobiography-Robinson/dp/0060555971\",\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0810001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">I Never Had It Made, “there was a great deal of suspicion in the black community about Nixon.” But he defended the vice president, writing that “in the years he’s been prominent in national affairs, Mr. Nixon has grown more than any other person presently in political life.”\n At the time, the parties were not as ideologically uniform as they are today — there were liberal Republicans and Democratic segregationists. And Robinson wasn’t ready to commit to Democrats if they didn’t nominate Humphrey, which they didn’t, leaving Robinson with a tough choice: Pick an untested Democrat or openly flout the preference of the Black community and support the Republican.\n \n  \n So, a few weeks before the mid-July Democratic National Convention, Robinson had his doubleheader of meetings with Nixon and Kennedy.\n In Nixon’s office, the vice president “said all the right things,” Robinson recalled in his autobiography. However, he was put off when he heard Nixon take a call and say, “No, well, I can’t do that. I’m tired of pulling his chestnuts out of this fire. He’ll have to work his own way out of this one.” After hanging up, Nixon told Robinson he had been talking about President Dwight D. Eisenhower. “It sounded as if the Vice President wanted me to disassociate him from Eisenhower since he knew that blacks, in the main, didn’t like Ike,” Robinson wrote. “It had the feel of a cheap trick.”\n But he had a much worse impression of Kennedy, whom he met with at a private home in Washington later that day.\n “My very first reaction to the Senator was one of doubt because he couldn’t or wouldn’t look me straight in the eye,” Robinson recalled, and he wound up writing a letter to JFK suggesting he do so in the future.\n “My second reaction, much more substantial, was that this was a man who had served in the Senate and wanted to be President but who knew little or nothing about black problems and sensibilities. He himself admitted a lack of any depth of understanding about black people … I was appalled that he could be so ignorant of our situation and be bidding for the highest office in the land.”\n That did it. Jackie Robinson chose Richard Nixon.\n \n He told the leaders at Washington’s African Methodist Church that he asked the same questions of both candidates, and while Nixon gave straightforward answers, “I had to challenge Kennedy six times.”\n Robinson’s decision to support Nixon was controversial. It earned him the enmity of some Black leaders, including Malcolm X, but Robinson didn’t waver. Later, he would even support another Republican for president, moderate Nelson Rockefeller.\n “That was a pretty gutsy thing for him to do, considering the entire black establishment was behind John F. Kennedy, but Jackie Robinson had unique experience in breaking through in the white world,” recalled William Safire, a young Nixon aide at the time. “The athlete with the greatest positive influence on black-white relations since the boxer Joe Louis was not the sort to flinch at being called an Uncle Tom for supporting a Republican.”\n It was also a decision Robinson came to regret.\n In the coming years, he became disillusioned not just with Nixon, but with the Republican Party. The GOP had moved steadily to the right through the turbulent 1960s, embracing a strategy of pandering to Southern whites that threatened civil rights gains spearheaded by the Democrats. When Nixon sought the presidency again eight years later, Robinson denounced him in a column headlined, “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America.” Robinson would die in 1972, half a century before the reactionary forces he saw emerging ultimately came to dominate the GOP.\n \n The relationship between Nixon and Robinson dated back to 1952, when Robinson was a star player in his prime and Nixon was a U.S. senator running as Eisenhower’s vice presidential running mate, on their way to winning the White House.\n Nixon was a huge sports fan and something of a fanboy, and had a hard time curbing his enthusiasm when he met Robinson at that year’s Republican National Convention in Chicago. According to Harrison McCall, president of the California Republican Assembly, who introduced the two men, Nixon told Robinson about first seeing him compete in a UCLA football game in 1939 — and about a specific play that stood out all these years later.\n “I said to Nixon as we walked away that, while Robinson had undoubtedly met a lot of notables in his career, nevertheless I was sure there was one person he would never forget,” McCall said.\n Nixon also watched Robinson play for the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field, including the World Series that fall, which the New York Yankees won in seven games. The two men were around the same age — Nixon was born six years earlier, in 1913 — and they both grew up in California, although under far different circumstances.\n \n  \n By 1957, a year after Robinson retired, he was praising Nixon for a speech in Ethiopia in which the vice president declared that the U.S. will never be satisfied until all Americans have equal opportunity. “In this endeavor,” Robinson wrote in one of many letters to Nixon, “you have my best wishes and steadfast cooperation.”\n “Dear Jackie,” Nixon replied. “As you can imagine, there were a number of letters on my desk when I returned to the office today after an absence of three weeks. I can assure you, however, that there were none which meant more to me than your thoughtful letter of March 19.” He called it a “privilege” to be working with Robinson “to achieve the important objective of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all Americans, and your expression of approval will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to me.”\n \n So Nixon had built up a groundswell of goodwill with Robinson in the years leading up to the 1960 election. But he soon squandered it.\n A key incident took place in October 1960, when Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed in Georgia. Nixon sat on his hands while the Kennedy campaign acted decisively. JFK called King’s wife, Coretta, to express support, and worked behind the scenes to press for King’s release. After he was freed, King publicly thanked JFK for his role and pointedly said he hadn’t heard from Nixon.\n At the Nixon campaign, Robinson had pushed for a robust response from his candidate.\n “He has to do this,” Robinson said at the time, according to a 1987 Safire column in the New York Times. “He has to call Martin right now, today. I have the number of the jail.” Safire said he brought Robinson to the campaign manager, who then escorted him to see Nixon.\n “Ten minutes later, he came out, tears of frustration in his eyes,” Safire wrote. “‘He thinks calling Martin would be ‘grandstanding,’ Robinson reported. ‘Nixon doesn't deserve to win.’”\n \n  \n In his autobiography, Robinson recalled: “I was in the behind-the-scenes struggle to persuade Dick Nixon to express his concern for Dr. King, but apparently his most trusted advisors were counseling him not to rock the racial boat. Add to this fact that Mr. Nixon refused to campaign in Harlem as his opponent did, and it is easy to understand why blacks overwhelmingly voted for Kennedy.”\n Despite his anger with Nixon, Robinson resisted entreaties from his wife and friends to switch sides.\n “It’s hard to explain why I stuck, disillusioned as I was,” he wrote. “It had something to do with stubbornness about continuing to want to believe in people even when everything indicates that they are no longer worthy of support.” He said he clung to the hope that Nixon would follow through on what he said at their meeting once the pressure of the campaign was over.\n \n Nixon lost and Robinson began to warm to President Kennedy after initially calling him out for a lack of progress on civil rights. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Robinson still supported a Republican, albeit a moderate one, for president in 1964 — Rockefeller, the New York governor — but this time with his eyes a bit more open.\n “I wasn’t about to be taken in instantly by the Nelson Rockefeller charm,” Robinson said. “After all, Richard Nixon had turned the charm on me too (although his is a bit more brittle compared with Rockefeller’s) and look how that had worked out.”\n And Robinson made a distinction between Rockefeller and the rest of the GOP: “I was not as sold on the Republican party as I was on the governor. Every chance I got, while I was campaigning, I said plainly what I thought of the right-wing Republicans and the harm they were doing.”\n Around this time, Robinson was also calling out Black militants such as Malcolm X, including in a November 1963 Chicago Defender column. Malcolm X replied in a Dec. 7 column in the same publication, addressed to “Dear Good Friend, Jackie Roosevelt Robinson”:\n Aren’t you the same ex-baseball player who tried to “mislead” Negroes in Nixon’s camp during the last presidential election? Evidently, you were the only Negro who voted for Nixon, because according to the polls taken afterward, very few Negroes were dumb enough to follow your “mislead.” … You never give up. You are now trying to lead Negroes into Nelson Rockefeller’s camp.\n Robinson went to the ’64 Republican National Convention in San Francisco as a special delegate, which he called “one of the most unforgettable and frightening experiences of my life.” Those were particularly striking words from a man who had endured death threats, hate mail and other abuse after debuting with the Dodgers in 1947.\n \n  \n “A new breed of Republican had taken over the GOP,” he wrote. “As I watched this steamroller operation in San Francisco, I had a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.”\n When he cheered on his candidate — shouting “‘C’mon, Rocky!’” — an angry Alabama delegate turned “menacingly” toward him, but the man’s wife held him back. Robinson, who early in his career was forced to turn the other check in the face of white infielders spiking him and white pitchers throwing at his head, had no such restraints now: “‘Turn him loose, lady, turn him loose!’ I shouted. I was ready for him. I wanted him badly, but luckily for him he obeyed his wife.”\n The Republicans nominated archconservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He’d also written off the Black vote, saying, “We’re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.” Robinson denounced him as a bigot and joined “Republicans for Johnson” — working to reelect Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who won in a landslide.\n \n In 1966, Robinson went to work for Rockefeller as a special assistant to the governor for community affairs, then backed him again in the 1968 presidential election, when Nixon staged a comeback. California Gov. Ronald Reagan challenged both candidates from the right, and when Robinson heard about reports of a possible Rockefeller-Reagan ticket to block Nixon, he told the New York governor he could never support that.\n With a laugh, Rockefeller replied: “You should have heard the hard time I had explaining you to Reagan.”\n After Republicans nominated Nixon for president, Robinson said he realized that the party didn’t care about him or his people.\n “The Republican Party has told the black man to go to hell. I offer to them a similar invitation,” Robinson wrote in his “Nixon Candidacy Imperils America” column, published by the Chicago Defender in 1968.\n \n  \n Still just 49, Robinson suffered a heart attack that year, and skipped the GOP convention on doctor’s orders — which he said was for the best.\n “It was a white folks affair and the once Grand Old Party’s new caretakers, under Richard Nixon, leaned over backwards to give Dixie some Southern comfort,” Robinson wrote, calling the party “insensitive and stupid” for choosing Nixon over Rockefeller.\n “They deserved the man they got — a two-time loser, an adjustable man with a convertible conscience — Richard Nixon.”\n Robinson quit his job with the Rockefeller administration and endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate, Humphrey, by now LBJ’s vice president. At a joint appearance in Harlem, a small group of African Americans heckled both men, one yelling “that Uncle Tom” Robinson should leave along with Humphrey.\n This time, Nixon won in a close election as the Democratic Party splintered.\n \n Even after turning away from Nixon, Robinson continued to correspond with him. In a 1970 letter republished in his autobiography, Robinson criticized the president for selecting “enemies” of the Black community as his top advisers. He singled out Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who had run for president in 1948 as a “Dixiecrat” and had played a key role at the ’68 GOP convention; Attorney General John Mitchell; and Vice President Spiro Agnew.\n “You would not support known anti-Semites to placate Jewish feelings.

In these and other cases, archconservatives like Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wield originalism — the conservative-favored theory that constitutional meaning should be determined by what the Constitution’s original drafters or ratifying generation would have understood particular words to mean. Tethering constitutional interpretation to founding historical understanding is a highly debatable proposition that imposes the views of enslavers and the few, white, land-owning males who were allowed to participate fully as citizens then on “We the People,” now.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314700373112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>But when conservatives seek to impose color blindness on the 14th Amendment, they are tossing aside their beloved originalism and ignoring the original intent of the Radical Republicans who championed it. Led by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, these avowed radicals were committed to the immediate, permanent end of slavery and rendering Black Americans full and equal citizens, a necessarily race-conscious project.</p> <p>At today’s oral argument, Justice Amy Coney Barrett conceded that there was some original evidence of race-consciousness by the framers of the 14th Amendment. Other conservative justices focused on contemporary arguments about whether race-conscious admissions constituted racial discrimination and whether a temporal limit on such affirmative action is legally required. Oddly, the petitioners that brought these cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina rely on the pro-integration <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> case to press their demand of color blindness.</p> <p>But a sincere originalist inquiry shows that petitioners have not met their burden of showing why multiple precedents should be overturned and race never be allowed to be considered.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Ever since the court’s ruling</b> in the <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/76-811\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bakke case&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/76-811&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Bakke case</a> in 1978, Harvard had been a poster child for how institutions of higher education may achieve robust diversity without discriminating against individuals. <i>Bakke</i> made it clear that no university may use rigid racial quotas as did the University of California Davis medical school when it set aside 16 places in a class of 100 for racial minorities. Justice Lewis Powell, the crucial swing vote in the case, voted against quotas, but cited “the Harvard College Admissions Program” as a model of moderation that would survive the strict scrutiny applied to policies that consider race. In ensuing decades, Harvard and other institutions constantly experimented, trying a range of tactics to achieve diversity without too much emphasis on race, while liberals and conservatives on the court battled over the meaning of equal protection as applied to university admissions.</p> <p>Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and, later, Anthony Kennedy refused to accept the argument of conservatives to the right of them that the Equal Protection Clause required color blindness.

The majority in <i>Dred Scott</i> tried to freeze in place a racial order, white supremacy, and the “peculiar institution” it justified, slavery, for all time — judicial despotism that accelerated civil war.</p> <p>The Radical Republican architects of Reconstruction were trying to end a system of racial caste — slavery — and reconstruct American society so that Blacks and other non-whites were placed on a plane of civil and political equality with whites. Eighteen Civil War and Reconstruction historians submitted a “friend of the court” brief in the pending affirmative action case to underscore the 14th Amendment framers’ race-conscious intentions. They pointed to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which declared that all persons would have the same rights “enjoyed by white persons,” including the power to own property and enter and enforce contracts. And the Freedmen’s Bureau Act, they noted, offered a phalanx of goods and services to Black Americans in order to facilitate the transition from slavery to full citizenship but gave white Civil War refugees more limited assistance. None of this legislation was color blind — it was expressly designed to treat the races differently in the service of making them more equal and adopted over President Andrew Johnson’s vetoes and cries of reverse-racism against whites.</p> <p>Southern white supremacists and the Supreme Court itself viewed these efforts in zero-sum terms. An effort to confer equal civil rights on violently suppressed Black Americans unfairly made them the “special favorite” of the laws the court stated when it <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/109us3\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;refused to uphold the Civil Rights Act of 1875&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/109us3&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">refused to uphold the Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>. It took nearly another century, after Black Americans mounted a civil rights revolution, to gain the right to sit and eat where they wanted and to not be discriminated against in employment and housing and have those rights enforced by the courts.</p> <p>Before then, the Supreme Court largely rendered the 14th Amendment a nullity for Black people, with formalistic ideas like “separate-but-equal,” refusing to see and name the real meaning of Jim Crow segregation for decades. Judicial hostility and a willed blindness to Black subordination ensured that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, did not begin to broadly enforce racial equality against massive white resistance until the Warren Court, in a series of cases from <i>Brown v. Board</i> to <i>Loving v. Virginia,&nbsp;</i>breathed life into its words. The 14th Amendment became a well of rights and equality not only for Black Americans but also women seeking gender equality and reproductive freedom, and interracial couples and LGBTQ people seeking marriage equality, among other aspirants for fairness. In sum, the 14th Amendment framers contemplated and tried to deliver pluralistic, universal equality rather than white patriarchal dominance.</p> <p>Since then, a political movement <a href=\"https://fedsoc.org/contributors/leonard-leo\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;to reshape the judiciary in a conservative mold&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fedsoc.org/contributors/leonard-leo&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">to reshape the judiciary in a conservative mold</a> has borne fruit and normalized judicial doctrines like originalism, textualism and color blindness on behalf of people who seem uncomfortable with American social and cultural change.

In a series of cases, a center-left majority established and reaffirmed that universities have a compelling interest in pursuing the educational benefits of diversity for all their students. To that end, they may consider race as a modest plus factor but may not engage in racial balancing or use rigid quotas.\n The only thing that has changed since the last time the court reaffirmed this precedent in 2016 is its personnel.\n The new 6-3 conservative majority on the Roberts Court is emboldened. The court Roe v. Wade\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\",\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06a001b\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06a001c\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">overturned Roe v. Wade, jettisoning women’s reproductive freedom, for example, while constitutionalizing gun owners’ prerogative to carry concealed weapons in public spaces. In these and other cases, archconservatives like Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wield originalism — the conservative-favored theory that constitutional meaning should be determined by what the Constitution’s original drafters or ratifying generation would have understood particular words to mean. Tethering constitutional interpretation to founding historical understanding is a highly debatable proposition that imposes the views of enslavers and the few, white, land-owning males who were allowed to participate fully as citizens then on “We the People,” now.\n \n \n But when conservatives seek to impose color blindness on the 14th Amendment, they are tossing aside their beloved originalism and ignoring the original intent of the Radical Republicans who championed it. Led by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, these avowed radicals were committed to the immediate, permanent end of slavery and rendering Black Americans full and equal citizens, a necessarily race-conscious project.\n At today’s oral argument, Justice Amy Coney Barrett conceded that there was some original evidence of race-consciousness by the framers of the 14th Amendment. Other conservative justices focused on contemporary arguments about whether race-conscious admissions constituted racial discrimination and whether a temporal limit on such affirmative action is legally required. Oddly, the petitioners that brought these cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina rely on the pro-integration Brown v. Board of Education case to press their demand of color blindness.\n But a sincere originalist inquiry shows that petitioners have not met their burden of showing why multiple precedents should be overturned and race never be allowed to be considered.\n \n Ever since the court’s ruling in the Bakke case in 1978, Harvard had been a poster child for how institutions of higher education may achieve robust diversity without discriminating against individuals. Bakke made it clear that no university may use rigid racial quotas as did the University of California Davis medical school when it set aside 16 places in a class of 100 for racial minorities. Justice Lewis Powell, the crucial swing vote in the case, voted against quotas, but cited “the Harvard College Admissions Program” as a model of moderation that would survive the strict scrutiny applied to policies that consider race. In ensuing decades, Harvard and other institutions constantly experimented, trying a range of tactics to achieve diversity without too much emphasis on race, while liberals and conservatives on the court battled over the meaning of equal protection as applied to university admissions.\n Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and, later, Anthony Kennedy refused to accept the argument of conservatives to the right of them that the Equal Protection Clause required color blindness. The court upheld programs from the University of Michigan School of Law and University of Texas that emulated the flexibility of the Harvard model. But it struck down a Michigan undergraduate admissions program that assigned an extra 20 points to minority applicants as too rigid.\n It makes sense that some consideration of race is constitutional. The framers of the 14th Amendment designed it to overrule the Dred Scott decision\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Dred-Scott-decision\",\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b000a\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc06b000b\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Dred Scott decision in which African Americans, free and enslaved, were deemed unworthy of American citizenship. The majority in Dred Scott tried to freeze in place a racial order, white supremacy, and the “peculiar institution” it justified, slavery, for all time — judicial despotism that accelerated civil war.\n The Radical Republican architects of Reconstruction were trying to end a system of racial caste — slavery — and reconstruct American society so that Blacks and other non-whites were placed on a plane of civil and political equality with whites. Eighteen Civil War and Reconstruction historians submitted a “friend of the court” brief in the pending affirmative action case to underscore the 14th Amendment framers’ race-conscious intentions. They pointed to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which declared that all persons would have the same rights “enjoyed by white persons,” including the power to own property and enter and enforce contracts. And the Freedmen’s Bureau Act, they noted, offered a phalanx of goods and services to Black Americans in order to facilitate the transition from slavery to full citizenship but gave white Civil War refugees more limited assistance. None of this legislation was color blind — it was expressly designed to treat the races differently in the service of making them more equal and adopted over President Andrew Johnson’s vetoes and cries of reverse-racism against whites.\n Southern white supremacists and the Supreme Court itself viewed these efforts in zero-sum terms. An effort to confer equal civil rights on violently suppressed Black Americans unfairly made them the “special favorite” of the laws the court stated when it refused to uphold the Civil Rights Act of 1875. It took nearly another century, after Black Americans mounted a civil rights revolution, to gain the right to sit and eat where they wanted and to not be discriminated against in employment and housing and have those rights enforced by the courts.\n Before then, the Supreme Court largely rendered the 14th Amendment a nullity for Black people, with formalistic ideas like “separate-but-equal,” refusing to see and name the real meaning of Jim Crow segregation for decades. Judicial hostility and a willed blindness to Black subordination ensured that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, did not begin to broadly enforce racial equality against massive white resistance until the Warren Court, in a series of cases from Brown v. Board to Loving v. Virginia, breathed life into its words. The 14th Amendment became a well of rights and equality not only for Black Americans but also women seeking gender equality and reproductive freedom, and interracial couples and LGBTQ people seeking marriage equality, among other aspirants for fairness. In sum, the 14th Amendment framers contemplated and tried to deliver pluralistic, universal equality rather than white patriarchal dominance.\n Since then, a political movement to reshape the judiciary in a conservative mold has borne fruit and normalized judicial doctrines like originalism, textualism and color blindness on behalf of people who seem uncomfortable with American social and cultural change. A new hostility to the project of racial reckoning has taken hold. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has undermined school integration, gutted the Voting Rights Act, refused to reign in extreme partisan gerrymandering which is de facto racial gerrymandering, and now seems poised to end affirmative action in college admissions and continue undermining American democracy. This, too, is contrary to the radical vision, embodied in the 15th Amendment, of conferring voting rights on non-whites in order to enable them to protect their equal status through politics.\n When Kennedy was on the court, he straddled these tensions. He was a judicial conservative. He disliked and voted against public policies that, in his view, placed too much emphasis on the race of individuals. But he acknowledged our nation’s legacy of segregation in education and housing, the racial inequality that resulted, and the need for state actors to continue through race-conscious means to redress racial isolation. He preferred to apply the Equal Protection Clause with strict scrutiny in individual cases rather than impose a complete prophylactic ban on any consideration of race. Perhaps Barrett, an adoptive mother of Black children, is inclined toward this middle position.\n Kennedy’s former law clerk, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, engages in race and gender conscious affirmative action in hiring law clerks. It would be ironic and unfortunate if he and Kennedy’s other former law clerk, Justice Neil Gorsuch, undermined the legacy of their former boss.\n The lower court in the Harvard case applied four decades of settled precedent to the copious evidence in this case and concluded that Asian applicants to Harvard had not been discriminated against, nor had constitutional principles been violated. It found that Harvard “valued all types of diversity, not just racial diversity, it considered race as part of holistic review process and, without considering race, its share of students of particular races would significantly decrease.”\n The willingness of the Roberts Court to overturn long established precedent undermines its legitimacy. Before the Civil War, the court enabled and protected the interests of enslavers. After the war, the court was hostile to the first Reconstruction; the Roberts Court is hostile to the second one, which began with the civil rights revolution.\n The 14th Amendment, by definition, was a race-conscious effort to end structures of white supremacy, as an honest, originalist inquiry reveals. If judicial originalists want to stay true to their originalist values, they should be supporting rather than undermining that reckoning.","dc:creator":"Sheryll Cashin","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/88/b9/916be390441ba0a87a15b5351d41/221031-scotus-affirmative-action-francis-chung-02.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Francis Chung/E&E News/POLITICO","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"(Left to right) Alize Hamilton, Jaheim McRae, and Iyana Beachem of the NAACP Youth and College division rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 31, 2022, as justices heard oral arguments on two cases on whether colleges and universities can continue to consider race as a factor in admissions decisions.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/88/b9/916be390441ba0a87a15b5351d41/221031-scotus-affirmative-action-francis-chung-02.jpg"}}]},"content":"Supreme Court conservatives can’t ignore the origins of the 14th Amendment.","contentSnippet":"Supreme Court conservatives can’t ignore the origins of the 14th Amendment.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/31/why-supreme-court-conservatives-should-back-affirmative-action-00064308","isoDate":"2022-10-31T20:36:27.000Z"},{"creator":"Andrew J.

It also would propose actions that lawmakers of both parties may be able to agree on, such as faster approvals for low-carbon energy sources like renewable power, small nuclear reactors and hydrogen.\n In interviews, the people familiar with the Republican priorities say it will keep a focus on voters' frustrations with gasoline prices, which surged in the past year amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the global economy's rebound from the pandemic.\n “Whatever big initiatives they have, it’s going to be focused on addressing inflation and energy costs,” said George David Banks, an outside energy adviser to Republicans who was former President Donald Trump’s top international energy adviser. “That’s the smart political move if you are trying to build momentum, and more of a majority the next election and trying to get the White House back.”\n \n \n Biden and Democratic lawmakers such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin are still hoping to pass permitting legislation this year that would ease approvals of oil and gas infrastructure along with clean energy sources like wind and solar power. Republicans have panned the Democratic plan as too modest, and their own expected legislative push will center on measures to reduce environmental reviews for all types of energy projects, speed approvals for oil pipelines and natural gas export terminals, as well as mines to produce critical minerals used in electric vehicles and uranium fuel that powers nuclear reactors.\n Democrats' long-shot end-of-year permitting push and Republicans' appetite for updating those rules when they are likely to take control of the gavels could help the two sides strike a deal in the next Congress, according to one former Republican legislative aide.\n “The exercise sets the table for compromise for early next year,” said Alex Herrgott, president and CEO of the Permitting Institute, a nonprofit, who was a senior staffer for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and who has been giving technical advice to congressional staffers working on permitting.\n Republicans say the Manchin proposal, or any similar compromise that might emerge in the waning months of this year, doesn’t go far enough to change the National Environmental Policy Act, the bedrock environmental law first adopted in 1970, which they see as a barrier to building energy infrastructure.\n A senior House GOP policy adviser acknowledged that Republicans' permitting legislation — modeled after a broad NEPA overhaul bill introduced in 2020 by Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) — would be a starting point of negotiations with congressional Democrats and Biden.\n “You want to negotiate from a position of strength, not weakness,” the senior GOP House aide said in an interview. “We are going to introduce our best stuff. With that said, we are realistic of what the Senate looks like.”\n House Republicans are also planning to scrutinize how the Biden administration deploys the $370 billion in clean energy measures that Congress approved in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_5376\",\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0500000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0500001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Inflation Reduction Act — though that GOP effort could risk undermining investments in energy improvements that would benefit red states.\n Republicans have contended that Democrats' climate policies have stoked inflation by slowing oil and gas production — even though production of both has climbed under Biden.\n But despite being heavily favored to take the House in the November election, Republicans may struggle to move legislation, even in a scenario where they also win control of the Senate. Any GOP majority in the Senate would likely fall well short of the 60 votes needed to overcome Democratic opposition, and Biden would be ready to veto anything that detracts from his agenda.\n That means Republicans are unlikely to pursue more far-reaching ideas, such as repealing the sprawling set of tax credits for clean energy development and manufacturing that forms the centerpiece of the Democrats’ climate law. Any bill that makes it through Congress is likely to be limited to smaller measures that have bipartisan support.\n \"There is a very narrow window for moving anything. It's going to be must-pass or significantly bipartisan,” said Christopher Guith, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute.\n The senior Republican House policy adviser pinpointed measures to bolster nuclear energy and critical minerals mining as potential areas of compromise with Democrats. The person added that House Republicans’ initial energy package focused on permitting won’t be their only attempt at advancing policy.\n Democrats, though, worry that even if Republicans seize control of only one chamber of Congress, they can still inflict significant damage on the gains that Biden's party has made in advancing the president’s climate agenda. Biden is seeking to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and put the country on a path toward net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n “My concern is that a lot of resources are going to be used to fend off [GOP] political attacks as opposed to resources and focus to implement these historic pieces of legislation,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) in an interview.\n Republicans acknowledge they don’t have the appetite to unwind the climate bill's major clean energy tax credits.

Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said in an interview.\n Instead, Republicans are expected to home in on oversight of spending stemming from the climate and infrastructure laws. Already, GOP lawmakers have released statements raising concerns with the implementation of the loan guarantee program under the Energy Department, which received billions in new funding and authority, and questioning the supply chain of renewable energy sources, which also will be boosted under the law.\n Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is in line to chair the House Energy and Commerce Committee if the GOP wins the majority, has called the influx of loan authority into the DOE loan guarantee program “Solyndra on steroids.”\n She was referring to the solar company that collapsed in 2011 after it received more than $500 million in federal loan guarantees, drawing years of Republican attacks on the Obama administration's clean energy programs. Democrats have countered that despite its demise, Solyndra was just a small part of the $90 billion in clean energy initiatives that spurred a huge expansion of wind, solar and other renewable power across the U.S.\n Former GOP Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, who was the top Energy and Commerce Republican before retiring last year, said his party has an obligation to vet the enormous spending in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n “Is it going out in a timely manner and in the right places? You look for overbuild and waste.

And Eastern Europe, which normally turns to the U.S. for new weapons, is increasingly considering buying from<b> </b>South Korea instead, which says it can deliver them faster and cheaper. </p> <p>South Korean defense firms have long been active in Europe, selling mobile howitzers and small arms to a number of countries over the past half-decade. But those deals have paled in comparison to the $5.8 billion blockbuster contract Poland signed with two South Korean companies in July. The agreement included 980 K2 Black Panther tanks, 672 K9 self-propelled howitzers and 48 FA-50 fighter planes, with deliveries on some of the tanks and howitzers expected to begin by the end of this year. The deals could be worth as much as $15 billion if all of the options are exercised in the coming years.</p> <p>And last month, Poland signed a contract with South Korean company<b> </b>Hanwha Defense for 288 Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers, with the first batch arriving next year, instead of waiting years to begin receiving the U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.</p> <p>Poland was initially seeking as many as 500 HIMARS from the U.S., but at an Oct. 19 signing ceremony with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak explained that “unfortunately due to limited industrial capabilities, it will not be possible for the equipment to be delivered in a satisfactory timeframe.

And Eastern Europe, which normally turns to the U.S. for new weapons, is increasingly considering buying from South Korea instead, which says it can deliver them faster and cheaper. \n South Korean defense firms have long been active in Europe, selling mobile howitzers and small arms to a number of countries over the past half-decade. But those deals have paled in comparison to the $5.8 billion blockbuster contract Poland signed with two South Korean companies in July. The agreement included 980 K2 Black Panther tanks, 672 K9 self-propelled howitzers and 48 FA-50 fighter planes, with deliveries on some of the tanks and howitzers expected to begin by the end of this year. The deals could be worth as much as $15 billion if all of the options are exercised in the coming years.\n And last month, Poland signed a contract with South Korean company Hanwha Defense for 288 Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers, with the first batch arriving next year, instead of waiting years to begin receiving the U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.\n Poland was initially seeking as many as 500 HIMARS from the U.S., but at an Oct. 19 signing ceremony with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak explained that “unfortunately due to limited industrial capabilities, it will not be possible for the equipment to be delivered in a satisfactory timeframe. Therefore, we started talks with South Korea — our proven partner.”\n The sheer size of the contracts, and promises of a fast turnaround on delivery, has caught the attention of the defense industry in the U.S.\n “There is concern from U.S. industry that this won’t stop with Poland,” said one industry insider who has dealings multiple U.S. defense firms, and who — like others in this article — requested anonymity to speak about relations between the U.S., Europe and South Korea.\n The person downplayed South Korea’s ability to fulfill orders quickly.\n “This is purely a marketing blitz by South Korea,” the insider said, noting that the plan to have equipment begin arriving by the end of the year is an ambitious schedule, and one that will be hard to keep consistent over the next few years. “They haven’t proven they can deliver the equipment as fast as they’re promising.”\n The Polish deals are expected to force trade-offs that could come at some cost for Seoul, requiring the government to prioritize building for Warsaw over resupplying its own military, said Haena Jo, a research analyst for defense and military at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n “It seems that the [South Korean] companies have the industrial capacity to meet the demands, which has been proven by the first batch of the K2 and the K9 having been handed over to Poland in such a short span of time,” Jo said. “The only way this could have been made possible must have been from the ROK reprioritizing Poland’s order over its own armed forces modernization, which is not common practice.”\n South Korea’s defense industry has long built weapons and equipment intended to be compatible with American gear, since the two countries would be expected to fight side-by-side in any conflict with North Korea or China.

After staking a primary bid on fealty to Donald Trump, he now stresses that the race should not be a referendum on the former president: “He's not on the ballot. I'm on the ballot.”</p> <p>He still believes the 2020 election result is “mathematically impossible” but now focuses more on rising costs, mentioning gas prices some 20 times in an interview this month in his campaign office. Grocery bills garnered another 10 mentions.</p> <p>And as Scholten and her allies point voters toward sexist diatribes that Gibbs wrote two decades ago in college, he has deployed his mom in a TV ad and on the campaign trail.</p> <p>“We just wanted to show that side of me and show a fun quirky side,” he said. “People love that. Everywhere I go with my mom. I mean, everywhere when she's here, people come up and say, ‘Oh I love your ad.’”</p> <p>His mother has been a formidable presence on the campaign trail. Walking across a field of tailgaters shortly before Grand Valley State University’s homecoming football game this month, Gibbs and mother were greeted warmly by several people who had seen the ad. A half-dozen groups stopped to pose for pictures.</p> <p>Gibbs, wearing his campaign t-shirt over a button-down, politely recited his resume to students and alumni and told them he would be laser-focused on lowering prices. His mother gently goaded them to “vote John Gibbs”.</p> <p>Democrats are concerned by what they see as a pivot by Gibbs, and they warn that he is an extremist masquerading as a common-sense candidate to dupe voters.</p> <p>“There is an overwhelming mission to roll back women's rights and reproductive rights,” Scholten said this month while knocking doors in Grand Rapids. “I am not an alarmist by nature, but if we don't wake up and take their word, we are going to be in a truly dangerous situation in very short order.”</p> <p>And, with Gibbs, Democrats say they are pointing to a pattern. He has left a trail of commentary on all corners of the Internet, especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p> <p>Some have been odd but benign, even<b>&nbsp;</b>amusing.

He is also a pro-Trump conservative who years ago suggested that women should not have the right to vote, referenced conspiracy theories that a prominent Democrat participated in Satanic rituals and mused that the lost city of Atlantis might be buried beneath the North Pole.\n Whether Gibbs, a Republican congressional candidate, can sell the first version to swing voters will determine whether his party holds onto this hotly contested battleground district — and how big a potential Republican House majority could be.\n He is part of a slate of controversial GOP House nominees testing what voters are willing to stomach as they vent backlash over the economy against Democratic majorities in Congress. Swing-seat matchups in several states include GOP candidates who have appeared to endorse fringe conspiracy theories, deny the validity of the 2020 election or have a pattern of questionable statements or internet postings.\n They could threaten the gains Republicans can make this fall — or, potentially, have their views among those that shape a future Republican House majority.\n For some, the post-primary campaign has been an exercise in extensive rebranding. Many of Gibbs' problematic writings were posted over two decades ago. \n \"People should look at me right now. Look at reality. Look at my staff, my campaign. Look at my mom and my videos,\" Gibbs said, pointing to his TV ad where his mom gushes about his humility and honesty. Then, he said, voters will \"quickly realize that things that have been thrown out there are not true.\"\n “They're trying to take something someone said X number of years ago and make it seem like they're a bad person,” he added.\n Once a GOP stronghold represented by former President Gerald Ford, the seat Gibbs seeks is now one of Democrats’ best pickup opportunities in the country. President Joe Biden carried it by nearly 9 points in 2020. A win would offer redemption for House Democrats’ campaign arm, which drew biting criticism for meddling in the Republican primary to boost Gibbs, an election denier, over incumbent Rep. Peter Meijer, who bucked his party to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 election and voted to impeach Trump in 2021.\n Few GOP candidates have compiled as massive an online record as Gibbs — which Democratic opponent Hillary Scholten and her allies have used to her advantage. They are also highlighting his opposition to abortion rights, even in cases of rape or incest, and saying he endorsed a plan to eliminate Social Security (which Gibbs denies).\n \n \n National Republicans are still airing TV ads for Gibbs, hoping that voters overlook his controversial comments amid their discontent about the economy. But internal polling from both parties shows Democrats have an advantage and Scholten, an immigration attorney, has significantly outraised him.\n “He’s just an extreme of what’s happened to the Republican party. He’s an extreme example of it,” said Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, who represents Flint, Mich. “Some of his past positions that he’s now trying to get himself away from don’t fit in the 21st century, let alone the 20th century in America.”\n Gibbs has struck a decidedly different tone as he campaigns for swing voters. After staking a primary bid on fealty to Donald Trump, he now stresses that the race should not be a referendum on the former president: “He's not on the ballot. I'm on the ballot.”\n He still believes the 2020 election result is “mathematically impossible” but now focuses more on rising costs, mentioning gas prices some 20 times in an interview this month in his campaign office. Grocery bills garnered another 10 mentions.\n And as Scholten and her allies point voters toward sexist diatribes that Gibbs wrote two decades ago in college, he has deployed his mom in a TV ad and on the campaign trail.\n “We just wanted to show that side of me and show a fun quirky side,” he said. “People love that. Everywhere I go with my mom. I mean, everywhere when she's here, people come up and say, ‘Oh I love your ad.’”\n His mother has been a formidable presence on the campaign trail. Walking across a field of tailgaters shortly before Grand Valley State University’s homecoming football game this month, Gibbs and mother were greeted warmly by several people who had seen the ad. A half-dozen groups stopped to pose for pictures.\n Gibbs, wearing his campaign t-shirt over a button-down, politely recited his resume to students and alumni and told them he would be laser-focused on lowering prices. His mother gently goaded them to “vote John Gibbs”.\n Democrats are concerned by what they see as a pivot by Gibbs, and they warn that he is an extremist masquerading as a common-sense candidate to dupe voters.\n “There is an overwhelming mission to roll back women's rights and reproductive rights,” Scholten said this month while knocking doors in Grand Rapids. “I am not an alarmist by nature, but if we don't wake up and take their word, we are going to be in a truly dangerous situation in very short order.”\n And, with Gibbs, Democrats say they are pointing to a pattern. He has left a trail of commentary on all corners of the Internet, especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n Some have been odd but benign, even amusing. In one online forum in 1998, Gibbs asked if the city of Atlantis “could be burried (sic) underneath the North Polar ice cap” and floated the possibility that it might been “a dominant root culture” that influenced Egyptians, South Americans and South Asian civilizations.\n Other musings have caused greater offense.\n His nomination to lead the Office of Personnel Management was derailed in 2020 after conspiratorial tweets he wrote years earlier resurfaced. Gibbs referenced a debunked conspiracy that claimed Democratic strategist John Podesta took part in a Satanic ritual, using the hashtag #SpiritCooking.\n Several weeks after Gibbs beat Meijer, the scion of a Midwest grocery dynasty, in an August primary, CNN revealed revealed Gibbs founded a \"think tank\" while at Stanford that suggested women did not “posess (sic) the characteristics necessary to govern\" and that the United States had “suffered” after the 19th Amendment. A Democratic super PAC seized on it, airing a TV ad featuring young women reading Gibbs’ direct quotes.\n \n \n Gibbs has described his comment as satire, instead pointing to his record of hiring women for his campaign and his mother’s long career at the Michigan Department of Transportation. He has argued that he should not be held accountable for what he said in jest long ago.\n “I like trolling a little bit, but I guess maybe I'm the first person in history who said something over the top in college,” Gibbs said in an attempt to brush off his comments.\n Democrats argue his denial can’t be trusted.\n “What has he done to show that he does not believe that?” Scholten said. “Why should we take this man's word for it when he's been so willing to lie about the results of the 2020 election?\n “He's got a lot of work to do rehabilitating himself with women,” she added. \n There have been other instances in which Gibbs has referred to women in misogynistic terms. In a blog post from 2007 — accessed via an Internet archive — Gibbs suggested that the U.S. was not a position to lecture Saudi Arabia on “what’s best for women” because American women have “widespread STDs” and millions “are on anti-depressants, are seeing therapists, and have low self-esteem.” In another post, he wrote that British women “look better and seem less manly/aggressive than ours.”\n “I guess that old European sense of being ladylike still remains a little, as opposed to the tough frontier attitude and feminist influence we developed here that killed that sense in women,” Gibbs wrote in 2007.\n In a statement, the Gibbs campaign said Scholten was trying to distract from important issues by focusing “her entire campaign on false attacks on John from internet posts at the age of 19, over 20 years ago while he attended Stanford.”\n “Gibbs’ actions speak for themselves,” his campaign said in a statement. “He works with women, speaks highly of them, and never hesitates to credit his mother, a woman who worked outside the home for years, for his success.\"\n Gibbs’ prolific trove of Internet posts are unique, but other nominees with baggage have hampered Republicans’ chances in places like Ohio, Nevada and North Carolina. While on the whole, the Republicans’ class of 2022 recruits have been more diverse than in years past, they are still grappling with some problematic candidates, though not enough to endanger their path to the majority.\n J.R. Majewski, a candidate for an Ohio battleground, shared pro-QAnon postings. But he lost support from national Republicans when he misrepresented his military experience, claiming that he had served in Afghanistan. Sam Peters, the GOP nominee challenging Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), has also used QAnon hashtags in a tweet.\n Majewski later said he was not a follower of QAnon, a posture adopted by several members of Congress who flirted with the conspiracy theory before they were elected, including Reps. Mayra Flores (R-Texas), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\n In eastern North Carolina, Democrats are airing ads highlighting Sandy Smith’s alleged record of domestic violence against her husbands and her daughter. She also suggested anyone found guilty of election fraud should be “executed.”\n And in a Washington State district, Democrats are running late TV ads against Joe Kent, a candidate who beat GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler in a primary after she voted to impeach Trump in 2021. Kent hired a campaign consultant associated with a white nationalist group, and national Democrats now view the district as a rare pickup opportunity, despite its red hue.\n Still, any of these candidates can still prevail, especially as economic woes weigh heavily on voters and the environment surges against Democrats.\n But in West Michigan, at least, Gibbs’ past appears to be complicating his ability to pick up some voters in the middle. Scholten has carefully courted independents and even some Republicans, releasing an ad featuring GOP officials supporting her campaign.\n She’s been willing to criticize Biden or her own party, urging Democrats to “stop the spending” in a recent TV ad. She also said she found Biden’s action on student loan relief “frustrating” and that she had concerns about federal vaccine mandates and the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n That has earned her at least some crossover votes, including Field Reichardt, a one-time GOP congressional candidate, who attended a fundraiser last week for Scholten headlined by Sen. Gary Peters at a mansion on the shores of Lake Michigan.\n After backing Meijer in the primary, he switched to Scholten, praising her as a “centrist” and “balanced” candidate.\n “He's so out there in never never land,” Reichardt said of Gibbs. “Moderate Republicans are probably going to be voting for Hillary.”\n Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.","dc:creator":"Ally Mutnick","media:content":{"$":{"type":"application/octet-stream","url":"https://static.politico.com/d7/11/4d2cc52346efa671546f08c84d70/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1389196330"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Scott Olson/Getty Images","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"John Gibbs a candidate for congress in Michigan's 3rd Congressional district speaks at a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump on April 02, 2022 near Washington, Michigan.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/d7/11/4d2cc52346efa671546f08c84d70/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1389196330"}}]},"content":"John Gibbs is one of several Republican House hopefuls facing a formidable obstacle: their own past statements.","contentSnippet":"John Gibbs is one of several Republican House hopefuls facing a formidable obstacle: their own past statements.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/31/michigan-john-gibbs-statements-00064104","isoDate":"2022-10-31T08:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"These 3 races may determine the fate of the Senate","link":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/10/24/senate-races-2022-midterms-john-king-contd-orig-mh.cnn","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 14:23:39 GMT","content":"CNN's John King uses the magic wall to break down three races that could determine whether Democrats or Republicans hold power in the US Senate.

Gov. John Fetterman, after enjoying a comfortable lead over Donald Trump ally and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz for much of the summer, went into a televised debate barely ahead in the polls.</p> <p>He stumbled, and his shaky performance came at perhaps the worst time, after he’s been pummeled — like other Democrats around the country — with bad news about increases in inflation and crime.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/de/ab/6b2dd53c41d2883d16863eed59b1/gettyimages-1244242295.jpg\"> <br> <p>Hours after the debate, where Fetterman struggled to speak clearly because of a stroke in May that nearly killed him, Oz pounded him as weak on crime at a press conference with the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association.</p> <p>“The state troopers just told me they confiscated, last quarter, seven times more fentanyl than they did in 2020,” he said at the police group’s headquarters. “Seven times increase, all of it because we’re aiding and abetting, inadvertently, cartels.”</p> <p>With crime up in several big cities, inflation whirring, and many voters pinning the blame on President Joe Biden, GOP and even some Democratic strategists said Republicans now have the momentum in key races for the Senate.

Gov. John Fetterman, after enjoying a comfortable lead over Donald Trump ally and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz for much of the summer, went into a televised debate barely ahead in the polls.\n He stumbled, and his shaky performance came at perhaps the worst time, after he’s been pummeled — like other Democrats around the country — with bad news about increases in inflation and crime.\n \n  \n Hours after the debate, where Fetterman struggled to speak clearly because of a stroke in May that nearly killed him, Oz pounded him as weak on crime at a press conference with the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association.\n “The state troopers just told me they confiscated, last quarter, seven times more fentanyl than they did in 2020,” he said at the police group’s headquarters. “Seven times increase, all of it because we’re aiding and abetting, inadvertently, cartels.”\n With crime up in several big cities, inflation whirring, and many voters pinning the blame on President Joe Biden, GOP and even some Democratic strategists said Republicans now have the momentum in key races for the Senate. But the GOP hasn’t put them away yet, and the contests are close enough that they could go either way.\n Though it’s too soon to know the impact of the debate, Fetterman’s one-time advantage has all but evaporated, with him ahead by 1 percentage point or less in polling averages. Though Democrats remain on top in Arizona and New Hampshire, the Senate races there are tightening. In Wisconsin, GOP Sen. Ron Johnson has slowly grown his lead to a modest 3 points, while in Nevada, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is in a dead heat. And in Georgia, Democrats fear that Republican Herschel Walker is gaining despite his myriad personal scandals.\n \n \n The GOP only needs to net a single seat to win back control of the Senate.\n “Things have shifted, and the odds at least modestly favor Republican control of the Senate,” said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). “If Republicans hold every seat that we have now, which is the way it's looking, then the chances of picking up one of Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, even New Hampshire — the odds of picking up at least one — are really pretty good.”\n Political forecasters now say that either party could end up with the majority next year, with many strategists arguing the GOP has not yet taken a commanding lead because of its flawed candidates and the still-unknown effect that the transformed debate over abortion could have on voters. In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada — and even Ohio and North Carolina, which lean Republican — the candidates are separated by 3 percentage points or less in polling averages.\n “The movement has been to Republicans,” said Neil Oxman, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist, referring to Senate and House contests. “Because the Biden administration is inept, period. Forgetting about the political crap, the problems of this country that are real have not been solved. … Gas is now close to $4 a gallon and food is still up. … I don’t have any idea what the policy of this administration is on the border.”\n \n  \n But even with an economy that 68 percent of voters describe as a recession — and polls showing abortion receding from the top of voters’ minds — the most important races for the Senate remain nail-biters in the polls.\n Chris Mottola, a Republican consultant, described the state of play in the top Senate battlegrounds as “a lot of coin flips.”\n “It’s murkier than usual because of the bizarre nature of a number of races,” he said. “At this point, races are usually baked in.”\n Throughout the nation, Republicans like Oz are spending the end of the campaign season hitting their Democratic opponents as unable to manage the country’s crime or inflation problems as they link them to Biden.\n In Georgia, a TV ad is trashing Biden and Sen. Raphael Warnock, the Democrat whom Walker is trying to unseat, as “giving us runaway inflation, higher taxes and wasteful spending on projects that don’t help Georgia.” \n In Nevada, a spot hits Cortez Masto as having “supported Biden’s hundreds of millions in reckless spending in other states.”\n Meanwhile, Democrats vying for the Senate are trying to outrun Biden’s unpopularity by pressing the same case they have for much of the year: that their Republican rivals are faulty, extreme and would further rip away abortion rights.\n On the same day that his opponent staged his press conference on crime, Fetterman held a rally in Pittsburgh where he honed in on a remark that Oz made at the debate about how “local political leaders” should have a say in abortion policy. He linked Oz to the state’s GOP gubernatorial nominee, Doug Mastriano, who opposes abortion with no exceptions. Though Oz is backing Mastriano, he has sought to distance himself from that stance, saying that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. \n “[Oz] believes the local political leaders should be the one making that choice, not a woman and her doctor,” Fetterman said at the rally, adding, “Basically, Doug Mastriano.”\n Some Democratic Senate candidates are also attempting to distance themselves from their party by making hyperlocal pitches to voters and running as anti-Washington, while keeping abortion at the forefront.\n Fetterman is running different TV ads in several media markets in Pennsylvania, seeking to appeal to regional pride and painting Oz as a carpetbagger from New Jersey. In one, a Republican woman jokes that Oz “probably thinks King of Prussia” — a neighborhood in the Philadelphia suburbs known for its mall — “is a European monarch.” Another spot says Fetterman “knows that Washington has forgotten us.”\n \n  \n In Georgia, Warnock is airing TV ads in markets throughout the state that feature him speaking in the different areas and local voters praising him. “Hello Albany!” he says in one such commercial. “Hello Macon!” he says in another.\n In Wisconsin, a joint TV ad by Democrat Mandela Barnes and the state party warns that “extremist right-wing politicians” like Johnson will ban abortion. And in Nevada, Cortez Masto’s allies are casting Republican Adam Laxalt as someone who “wants to make abortion here in Nevada illegal” and “went to law school in Washington, D.C.” in a spot.\n But it’s a difficult line for Democrats to walk at a time when their party controls the White House and Congress.\n Chris Hartline, a spokesperson for the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, said that Democrats’ job approval ratings are dropping as political gravity pulls them down in states such as Georgia.\n “The closer you get to Election Day, the more the environment takes over, and the more both Warnock and [Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey] Abrams numbers start to look more and more like Joe Biden's,” he said.\n David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said “our incumbents have the advantage in their races, we have multiple offensive opportunities strongly in play, and Democrats are well positioned to protect and expand our Senate majority.”\n There are signs that Republicans are retreating in some battleground states. The top Republican super PAC, Senate Leadership Fund, pulled nearly $6 million in advertising reservations earlier this month from New Hampshire, where Don Bolduc is the Republican nominee despite the GOP establishment’s attempts to stop him during the primary. However, the National Republican Senatorial Committee committed about $1 million since, as has a super PAC.\n Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, also cut bait in Arizona, where Republican Blake Masters has made a number of past controversial remarks about the Unabomber, World War II and other topics, though other GOP groups have stepped in to help pick up the slack.\n “After losing his primary proxy war with Trump, Mitch McConnell is being forced to play a game of musical chairs with his money because he got saddled with fundamentally flawed candidates who are too extreme,” said JB Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC, the leading Democratic Senate super PAC, of the withdrawing of funds by its Republican counterpart.\n Jack Pandol, communications director for Senate Leadership Fund, said “Democrats are losing altitude because they ignored glaring warnings from voters to concentrate on their pet issues instead. It’s sad to watch their last-minute desperation to distract from their own failures.”\n Ohio’s contest also remains too close for comfort for the GOP. Republican J.D. Vance is leading Democrat Tim Ryan by 1 to 2 percentage points in polling averages in a race that has been close for months, according to election surveys.\n And North Carolina has been more competitive than some expected, though Republican Ted Budd has grown his lead recently and is now ahead of Democrat Cheri Beasley by nearly 3 to 5 points.\n \n  \n At the same time, Democrats and their allies have continued to plow money in recent weeks into Senate contests in Washington and Colorado, where Biden won by double digits, a sign they aren’t taking any chances there, either.\n Democrats are hoping another factor that can help them outpace the dour national mood is a solid ground game. Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that it has invested “significantly” in its get-out-the-vote operation.\n “I believe that we have a far superior effort to what the Republicans have,” said Peters. “The Republicans are basically relying on billionaire donors to put up negative nasty false ads against people.

Nixon had stoked the economy and forecast “peace with honor” in Vietnam. Only the trifling cloud called Watergate shadowed the president’s expected victory.</p> <p>All of which placed Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts under intense pressure. His Judiciary Committee investigators had corralled a witness who, given the drama of a public hearing, an eager media and the dazzle of the Kennedy name, could shatter the Watergate cover up and breathe new life into McGovern’s campaign.<br></p> <br> <p>“A giant fraud is being perpetrated upon the American people, and anyone who has it within his power to help expose that fraud has a responsibility to the public and to himself to do so as soon and as dramatically as possible,” one of Kennedy’s advisers contended in a memo to the senator.</p> <p>But a man-to-man showdown with Nixon would raise the issue of Kennedy’s own scandalous behavior. Only three years had passed since the night on Chappaquiddick, when he drove his car off an unmarked bridge and cost Mary Jo Kopechne her life. And it could be seen as partisan hatchetry.</p> <p>“I think the public should get as many facts as possible before the election, but I see no reason why we have to be the ones who do it … if our doing it is going to raise a serious collateral issue,” another aide responded.</p> <p>In the end, not for the first or last time in a storied career, Ted Kennedy’s private failings afflicted his public performance. He held no hearings in that election season. Nixon carried 49 states.</p> <p>In the hyper-partisan era of Donald Trump, the notion of a politician’s personal shortcomings hurting their political chances seems quaint. Far from disqualifying him, the 45<sup>th</sup> president’s litany of controversies — from shady business practices to the Billy Bush tape — seemed to boost his image and excite his base. Even now, following the events of January 6, Trump remains the de facto leader (and presumptive 2024 nominee) of the GOP.</p> <p>But as Ted Kennedy’s career shows, politics did not always operate this way. At key junctions in American history, his vulnerability on issues of personal character kept him from acting on public policy. His silence during the hearings over Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a classic example.</p> <p>Now, thanks to the unheralded release of a Senate Judiciary Committee file on Watergate that was improperly withheld from the public for decades, we have another case in point. This is the untold story of why Kennedy declined to stage what one aide described as “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions” and, to the dismay of fellow Democrats, dawdled as Nixon coasted to a landslide reelection.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Kennedy’s career has </b>many might-have-beens. The most widely known occurred in 1991, when one of his investigators, Ricki Seidman, was the first Senate aide to speak to Anita Hill and hear her allegation that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the years before his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p> <p>Kennedy had played a leading role in defeating another conservative nominee to the high court — Judge Robert Bork — in 1987, but now was in no shape to question Thomas’ behavior. The senator was ensnared by scandal that spring and summer after he woke his son and nephew for some late-night carousing in Palm Beach, Fla. The nephew, William Kennedy Smith, was charged with raping a young woman at the Kennedy family estate that night.</p> <p>The investigator was told to stand down and passed the information to other Senate offices. Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden led the subsequent public hearings. Kennedy became a target of ridicule after tales of how he had wandered the grounds of his seaside home that night, without pants, reached the writers at Saturday Night Live and the Tonight show.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4f/d5/36830e7140dba4a1f80bb59f047a/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary1.jpg\"> <br> <p>The Bork-slayer had been silenced. “Viscerally and visually he was getting smaller and smaller … just sinking into his chair … becoming a little shriveled man,” said Judith Lichtman, the longtime women’s advocate. If Kennedy had not been cowed by the Palm Beach scandal, author and journalist Timothy Phelps, who broke the Hill story, told me, Thomas would never have served on the Supreme Court.</p> <p>Kennedy’s hometown newspaper, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, questioned his continued usefulness in office.</p> <p>“Those who have generally supported Kennedy over the years — and we include ourselves in that number — have maintained that his private behavior, however reprehensible one judges it to be, has not adversely affected his performance as a public official,” the <i>Globe </i>editorialized. “Sadly, that contention can no longer be made.”</p> <p>Chappaquiddick, Palm Beach, “and other, periodic results of reckless behavior by Kennedy have diminished his moral authority. … Neither he nor his supporters can again assert that his private life has no impact on the discharge of his public duties.”</p> <p>There are other instances where Kennedy was muzzled by his private misbehavior. In the months after Chappaquiddick, he had sat on the sidelines as Sen. Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, and other liberals led the successful opposition to two of Richard Nixon’s Supreme Court nominees — federal judges Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, two Southerners whose speeches and rulings showed them as defenders of the South’s white supremacist order.</p> <p>Kennedy’s “moral armor was in bad repair,” wrote newsman William Eaton, who would win a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the nomination. “This was right after Chappaquiddick,” Jason Berman, an aide to Bayh, said when I spoke to him. “You can understand, if you were going to make the fight on grounds of ethics and morality, why Teddy would not have been the best candidate.”</p> <p>A few months later, his colleagues in the Democratic caucus dumped Kennedy, whom they had elevated to lead them in battle against the wily and formidable Nixon, from his job as Senate whip.</p> <p>“He took us with him over that bridge,” said Sen. Walter Mondale, the liberal Democrat from Minnesota, “because he was sort of our star.” The Senate Democrats replaced Kennedy with the more conservative Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. “It was a huge humiliation within the Senate — a very personal thing that happened to him that senators rarely do to each other,” Mondale said. “Chappaquiddick got him.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/70/1d/4b7fd6574015a3d465cab5c7e2d6/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary2.jpg\"> <br> <p>But it is not until now, with the quiet return of a Senate Judiciary Committee’s file on Watergate to its rightful place in the National Archives, that this new story can be told.</p> <p>The Watergate file had been wrongly withheld from historians and biographers with Kennedy’s papers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, instead of at the Archives, where Senate committee records are supposed to be kept. It reappeared in the Judiciary committee files after Kennedy’s death. I came upon it in my research for a new biography, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Ted Kennedy: A Life</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc07b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc07b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\"><i>Ted Kennedy: A Life</i></a>, from which this article is adapted.</p> <p>The documents tell of 1972, a time when Nixon was riding high, having made his world-jolting trip to China — and following it up by joining Soviet leaders at a momentous summit, for the signing of arms control treaties, in Moscow.</p> <p>But the president — who gnawed on the belief that the Kennedy clan had stolen the 1960 election from him — was possessed with the fear that they would do it again, with Ted Kennedy as a candidate, in 1972.</p> <p>“Nixon was mesmerized by Ted Kennedy. Even after Chappaquiddick,” Tom Korologos, who lobbied for the administration on Capitol Hill, told me. “The Kennedys had screwed him in 1960. He had a syndrome. He didn’t want it to happen again. He was paranoid. Really. Paranoid.”</p> <p>Nixon pressed his staff for dirt on Kennedy and other Democrats. In May of 1971, he had ordered them to proceed with a campaign of bugging and surveillance. “I want, Bob, more use of wiretapping,” he told his chief of staff, H.R. “Bob” Haldeman. “Kennedy… Maybe we can get a real scandal on any one of the leading Democrats.”</p> <p>The president’s men picked up the pace, with schemes to wreak havoc at the Democratic national convention in Miami, to break into McGovern’s headquarters and to bug Democratic headquarters at the Watergate office building. On June 17, at the Watergate, a team of Nixon’s burglars got caught.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/17/ed/27a8aa794c38b0dabe283df1006e/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary3.jpg\"> <br> <p>Watergate was a self-inflicted wound by Nixon. The Democratic convention was a catastrophe that summer — with scuffling between the New Left and vanquished party moderates, sophomoric liberal antics (there were votes to give Mao Zedong, Archie Bunker and Benjamin Spock the vice-presidential nomination) and a general lack of discipline that delayed McGovern’s acceptance speech until almost 3 a.m. “Only in Guam,” noted the campaign chronicler Theodore H. White, “was George McGovern speaking in prime time under the American flag.”</p> <p>And then bad turned to worse, as the vice-presidential candidate — Senator Joseph Eagleton of Missouri — was compelled to resign from the ticket for not disclosing hospitalizations, electric shock sessions and other mental health treatments he had undergone.</p> <p>Nixon’s own convention was superbly choreographed. He had browbeat the Federal Reserve into stoking the roaring economy. He was cutting a deal with the North Vietnamese that would doom the American ally, South Vietnam, in the long term but give Nixon something to boast about that fall. “Peace is at hand,” said his adviser, Henry Kissinger, in October.</p> <p>Through all this, the Watergate coverup continued. With perjury and payoffs, Nixon and his aides cloaked the president’s involvement. At the <i>Washington Post</i>, two young reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helped keep the story alive. Out of the public eye, the <i>Post</i>’s efforts were matched by one of Kennedy’s aides, the inestimable James Flug, that summer and fall.</p> <p>Kennedy had found how his family’s mystique lured the best and brightest to Washington and to his staff, and Flug was a premier example. Brooklyn-born and tough, he graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from Harvard and then from Harvard Law School. Kennedy kept a loose rein on his staff, Flug told me before his death in 2020, and he was given freedom to roam. He excelled, said a fellow aide, in taking Ted Kennedy into political thickets, from which the senator had to hack his way out.</p> <p>Watergate was the ultimate thicket. The vehicle was Kennedy’s little Judiciary subcommittee. In addition to a panel on refugees, and a Senate Labor subcommittee on health, he chaired an all-purpose toolbox with jurisdiction over the federal government’s administrative procedures and practices. Known as Ad Prac, its charter was basically anything that Ted Kennedy could convince the Judiciary chairman, James Eastland of Mississippi, to OK. “It was bottom-up work,” former staffer Thomas Susman said. Kennedy’s aides brought their groundwork to the boss. He then made the choice to join, or to skip, a scrap.</p> <p>Flug was the Ad Prac counsel. By mid-August, he was well-versed in the Watergate scandal and plugged into the network of lawyers, government accountants and investigators who were building a case against the president’s men. “Flug was finding connections and weaving patterns that were just sort of mind-boggling,” Kennedy would recall, in an oral history for the University of Virginia.</p> <p>Flug was one of the first congressional investigators to interview Alfred Baldwin, the Nixon hireling who monitored the Watergate wiretaps from a hotel across the street — and famously served as the lookout for the burglars on the night of the break-in. It is Baldwin who is immortalized in the opening scenes of the motion picture <i>All the President’s Men, </i>alerting his cohorts (“Base One to Unit One — we have some activity here…”) to the arrival of the police<i>.</i></p> <p>Flug warned Kennedy, in a long August memo, that Nixon’s men were succeeding, via perjury and other means, at covering up the ties between the burglars, who were about to be indicted and brought to trial, and the White House.</p> <p>“The information in the indictments will probably not provide much real detail on the who, what or how of the plot,” Flug wrote. “The indictments will be better than nothing, (but) they will be of very limited utility in bringing out the whole story.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democrats had chosen McGovern. Kennedy gave a rousing speech at the convention but turned McGovern down when asked to be his running mate. Kennedy’s family was worried about his safety, and he instinctively recoiled from the inconsequential duties of the office. “I am not cut out that way,” he told the <i>Boston Globe</i>. “The vice presidency is good for some people. However, I don’t need that kind of exposure.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/38/18/4e8ae8304b60b3bbd30934fb32af/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary4.jpg\"> <br> <p>Performing a mitzvah for the party might have been a smart move. By declining to serve, Kennedy squandered an opportunity to be vetted and immunized, on a national stage, for his behavior at Chappaquiddick. “You do the penance, as they say, as a vice presidential candidate,” <i>Boston Globe</i> editor Robert Healy told White House aide Charles Colson, in a transcribed phone call. “You do the bit for the party and then in ’76 you have done it and because you’ve done it Chappaquiddick fades away. … I think that really makes some sense.”</p> <p>“That’s the one rationale,” Colson agreed.</p> <p>McGovern understood Kennedy’s reticence but bristled at the selfishness Kennedy displayed <i>after</i> declining the candidate’s offer. Like a wolf marking his territory, Kennedy blackballed McGovern’s second choice, Mayor Kevin White of Boston. If Kennedy wished to run for president himself someday, he did not see the sense in raising another Irish-Catholic from Massachusetts to national prominence. With cursory vetting, and the clock running, McGovern picked Eagleton instead.</p> <p>It was a disastrous start for McGovern’s fall campaign. Nixon had the economy on fire and a string of foreign policy successes to tout. Despite the Democratic nominee’s military record — as a bomber pilot, he flew 35 missions against the Nazis — Nixon portrayed him as an irresolute radical.<br></p> <br> <p><b>McGovern’s opportunity to </b>regain ground, it seemed, rested with the Watergate scandal. It “has become one of the major issues of the 1972 Presidential campaign,” an eight-page, single-spaced McGovern campaign memo to the nation’s editors and television producers declared rather hopefully on September 22. “Repeated Republican denials of complicity in the break-in have been met with repeated discoveries of evidence to the contrary.”</p> <p>In his own memo, Flug told Kennedy that the office was getting heat from the McGovern campaign. “They, of course, think this is the best thing they have going.”</p> <p>Kennedy faced a decision, similar to those he confronted in the Haynsworth and Carswell battles. Did he have the credibility, after Chappaquiddick, to launch a highly public investigation of corrupt acts by others? Would his presence distort the public’s perception of the crimes committed in Nixon’s name?</p> <p>“My natural inclination, like yours, is to go — it’s too meaty a thing to stay away from,” Flug urged his boss. “But for the same reason, it could backfire big and leave you looking like McGovern’s political hatchet man.”</p> <p>Kennedy’s choice was a topic of debate for years. Nixon and his aides would ultimately credit “the fine hand of the Kennedys” with the creation of the Senate Watergate Committee, the appointment of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, and the president’s slow and steady downfall. McGovern’s advisers, however, were just as agitated — filling the air with “unprintable expletives,” according to columnist Stewart Alsop — by what they perceived as Kennedy’s failure to act. Upon examination, McGovern may have had the better cause to complain.</p> <p>There were, to be sure, complications. To start, there was Kennedy’s proposed use of Ad Prac. Some in the Senate objected to his view of the panel as an unfettered hunting license and argued that a Watergate investigation would be better launched from a committee with clear jurisdiction like Government Operations. On the other hand, Kennedy had held hearings on the threat posed to civil liberties by wiretapping long before Watergate, and so had precedent on his side. Nor did other senators show an appetite in taking on Nixon. The relevant committees were in the hands of Southerners, aghast at McGovern’s liberal views and with no fierce desire to hand him the White House.</p> <p>A month before the election, the leading alternative — Senator Sam Ervin, who chaired Government Operations and a Judiciary subcommittee — took himself out of the running. Instead, he encouraged Kennedy to unmask the cover up with a televised public hearing — Kennedy vs. Nixon — that would guarantee blanket coverage and commentary. They had a prize catch in Baldwin, who could spin a gripping blow-by-blow account of the burglary, the bugging and the involvement of Nixon campaign officials. “I want to urge you to consider hearings,” Ervin said. It would be “a perfectly proper congressional inquiry into how the Justice Department is performing its obligation to the American people.”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/95/36/a9ddafd64f748d0cf4c1d7706fe0/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary5.jpg\"> <br> <p>As a dean of the Senate and a voice from the South, Ervin carried weight. He was “bad on civil rights,” but “incredibly good on civil liberties,” Kennedy would recall. Ervin’s imprimatur would keep peace in the Senate, but it led Kennedy to other questions: Would his investigation be deemed credible by the press and the voters? Could he lose more than he might win?</p> <p>Kennedy had Flug poll the clan. Calls went out to Burke Marshall and others from the late Robert Kennedy’s staff, to McGovern, and to Kennedy advisers David Burke, Richard Goodwin and Lawrence O’Brien. Attorney Edward Bennett Williams and his partner Joseph Califano, whose firm represented the <i>Washington Post</i> and the Democratic Party, were consulted. Kennedy’s allies on the subcommittee — Senators Phil Hart of Michigan, John Tunney of California, Bayh and North Dakota Sen. Quentin Burdick — were canvassed as well.</p> <p>On September 28, Flug sent Kennedy three memos. Written by different advisers — and signed only “X” and “Y” and “Z” to encourage candor — each outlined a course of action.</p> <p>The first memo, by “X,” gave the case for restraint. Putting Baldwin on the stand would be “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions,” X acknowledged. But it could make it impossible for the other Watergate burglars to get a fair trial. “Especially in the fields of justice and liberty, the most outrageous dimension of the Nixon Administration has been its constant readiness to sacrifice principles … (in favor of) short-run pragmatic expediency,” X wrote. “To fight such cynicism and opportunism by partaking of it ourselves would be hypocrisy of the first order.”</p> <p>Principle aside, there was politics to consider. Nixon would lash back — accusing Kennedy of trashing the defendants’ rights.</p> <p>“We would be playing in a rough league, and we would have to be prepared to play rough,” X wrote. Baldwin’s testimony would be one man’s story, and relied in part on hearsay. They needed more proof that the White House was involved or that “the fix is in” at the Justice Department. “Right now we don’t have it.”</p> <p>The second memo, from “Y,” gave the aggressive point of view, and was titled, “Why Ad Prac should announce Watergate Hearings Now.” Here was the case for a full-fledged assault before the election. “Even if Baldwin is our only witness, his story is one of ruthless lawlessness by employees of the (Nixon) Re-Election Committee,” Y wrote. They had a moral obligation to expose Nixon’s transgressions. “If we are going to stand quietly in the face of both a scandal of historic proportions and a politically motivated effort to … cover up that scandal until after Election Day, then we deserve the kind of government we are getting.”</p> <p>“It would be wise to be polite and say that the facts will come out in the course of the criminal trial,” wrote Y. “But the cruel truth is that the investigation has been in the hands of (Nixon administration) officials with the grossest kind of conflict of interest who delayed the indictment so that a pre-election trial would be impossible.”</p> <p>“This is a hearing that would be the biggest thing … and would get across to the public, in a way that even the trial itself won’t do, the enormity of the violations of laws and rights,” Y argued. “When a gross impropriety like the Watergate plot occurs, it is much more important to get to the heart of the matter, fix ultimate responsibility … and to assure that the whole process is cleansed.”</p> <p>The third memo, by “Z,” contained a cautionary, middle approach, outlining the path that Kennedy ultimately chose: to keep investigating, but to forego hearings. It was temperate, responsible — and timorous. To the considerable exasperation of McGovern’s presidential campaign, and some on his own staff, Kennedy chose not to give the voters a full account before the November election. “I don’t want a circus or to look like a headline hunter,” Kennedy told a reporter from <i>National Journal.</i></p> <p>And so the moment passed. Americans would not hear before the election what Baldwin had to say: that Attorney General John Mitchell and other high-ranking Nixon administration officials were involved in the break-in, that McGovern headquarters had also been targeted for bugging, or how the cover-up began.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4d/54/f428f4b249969afa616eba0a5045/mag.Farrell.ChappaquiddickExcerpt-Secondary6.jpg\"> <br> <br> <p><b>Baldwin ultimately gave</b> an interview to the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> but it lacked the punch of a televised congressional hearing and faded from the public debate. Things seemed settled until, on October 10, Woodward and Bernstein disclosed that the Watergate break-in was but part of a widespread, well-funded campaign of political sabotage and espionage coordinated by White House officials.</p> <p>This gave Kennedy a second opportunity — a field of inquiry that would not threaten the defendants’ rights in the upcoming Watergate trial. His staff would launch a “preliminary inquiry,” Kennedy announced. Flug went back to work.</p> <p>Bernstein was invited to interview the senator. He found him guarded, cagey. “I know the people around Nixon,” Kennedy told him. “They are thugs.” But he had no illusions about what he could accomplish this late in the election. At best, his investigation would be a “holding action,” he said, to keep Nixon’s crew from destroying the evidence, and to keep some heat on those running the cover-up.</p> <p>Politically, there was “no percentage” in it, Kennedy confided to the reporter. The White House would go “with everything it had to smear him,” he said. He was vulnerable on Mary Jo Kopechne’s death and other “nickel-and-dime stuff.”</p> <p>Indeed, Nixon’s allies — Strom Thurmond, Barry Goldwater and Clare Boothe Luce — would soon raise Chappaquiddick anyway.</p> <p>“There is still that little truism which says people who live in glass houses should not throw stones,” Goldwater said. In an op-ed in the <i>New York Times</i>, Luce quoted the bumper sticker slogan: “Nobody was drowned at Watergate.”</p> <p>Flug was permitted to proceed. Subpoenas were issued. Bank records were collected. Kennedy’s staff ran down the head trickster, Donald Segretti, and the paymaster — Nixon’s personal lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach. But, once again, no hearings were held. At a climactic meeting with his staff in December, Kennedy decided to put off the confrontation.</p> <p>“Since the expected outcome was so uncertain, and the prospect of EMK falling on his face was so possible, no decision was made,” an internal office memo noted.</p> <p>At the White House, as Nixon’s secret taping system captured their remarks, the president and his men chortled. Kennedy was backing off, Haldeman told the pleased Nixon, because he had been compromised at Chappaquiddick.</p> <p>On Nixon’s birthday, in early January, his staff sent him a telegram. Allegedly from Kennedy, the “Director of Water Safety,” it invited Nixon to “a quiet weekend at Chappaquiddick” for a “homey family barbeque” and added, “P.S. Bring your bathing suit.”</p> <p><i>From the book </i><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667092770947,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667092770947,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2678-ddd7-afd7-3ef8e27f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;TED KENNEDY: A Life&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-2678-ddd7-afd7-3ef8e27f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">TED KENNEDY: A Life</a><i>, by John A.

Nixon had stoked the economy and forecast “peace with honor” in Vietnam. Only the trifling cloud called Watergate shadowed the president’s expected victory.\n All of which placed Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts under intense pressure. His Judiciary Committee investigators had corralled a witness who, given the drama of a public hearing, an eager media and the dazzle of the Kennedy name, could shatter the Watergate cover up and breathe new life into McGovern’s campaign.\n \n “A giant fraud is being perpetrated upon the American people, and anyone who has it within his power to help expose that fraud has a responsibility to the public and to himself to do so as soon and as dramatically as possible,” one of Kennedy’s advisers contended in a memo to the senator.\n But a man-to-man showdown with Nixon would raise the issue of Kennedy’s own scandalous behavior. Only three years had passed since the night on Chappaquiddick, when he drove his car off an unmarked bridge and cost Mary Jo Kopechne her life. And it could be seen as partisan hatchetry.\n “I think the public should get as many facts as possible before the election, but I see no reason why we have to be the ones who do it … if our doing it is going to raise a serious collateral issue,” another aide responded.\n In the end, not for the first or last time in a storied career, Ted Kennedy’s private failings afflicted his public performance. He held no hearings in that election season. Nixon carried 49 states.\n In the hyper-partisan era of Donald Trump, the notion of a politician’s personal shortcomings hurting their political chances seems quaint. Far from disqualifying him, the 45th president’s litany of controversies — from shady business practices to the Billy Bush tape — seemed to boost his image and excite his base. Even now, following the events of January 6, Trump remains the de facto leader (and presumptive 2024 nominee) of the GOP.\n But as Ted Kennedy’s career shows, politics did not always operate this way. At key junctions in American history, his vulnerability on issues of personal character kept him from acting on public policy. His silence during the hearings over Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a classic example.\n Now, thanks to the unheralded release of a Senate Judiciary Committee file on Watergate that was improperly withheld from the public for decades, we have another case in point. This is the untold story of why Kennedy declined to stage what one aide described as “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions” and, to the dismay of fellow Democrats, dawdled as Nixon coasted to a landslide reelection.\n \n Kennedy’s career has many might-have-beens. The most widely known occurred in 1991, when one of his investigators, Ricki Seidman, was the first Senate aide to speak to Anita Hill and hear her allegation that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the years before his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n Kennedy had played a leading role in defeating another conservative nominee to the high court — Judge Robert Bork — in 1987, but now was in no shape to question Thomas’ behavior. The senator was ensnared by scandal that spring and summer after he woke his son and nephew for some late-night carousing in Palm Beach, Fla. The nephew, William Kennedy Smith, was charged with raping a young woman at the Kennedy family estate that night.\n The investigator was told to stand down and passed the information to other Senate offices. Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden led the subsequent public hearings. Kennedy became a target of ridicule after tales of how he had wandered the grounds of his seaside home that night, without pants, reached the writers at Saturday Night Live and the Tonight show.\n \n  \n The Bork-slayer had been silenced. “Viscerally and visually he was getting smaller and smaller … just sinking into his chair … becoming a little shriveled man,” said Judith Lichtman, the longtime women’s advocate. If Kennedy had not been cowed by the Palm Beach scandal, author and journalist Timothy Phelps, who broke the Hill story, told me, Thomas would never have served on the Supreme Court.\n Kennedy’s hometown newspaper, the Boston Globe, questioned his continued usefulness in office.\n “Those who have generally supported Kennedy over the years — and we include ourselves in that number — have maintained that his private behavior, however reprehensible one judges it to be, has not adversely affected his performance as a public official,” the Globe editorialized. “Sadly, that contention can no longer be made.”\n Chappaquiddick, Palm Beach, “and other, periodic results of reckless behavior by Kennedy have diminished his moral authority. … Neither he nor his supporters can again assert that his private life has no impact on the discharge of his public duties.”\n There are other instances where Kennedy was muzzled by his private misbehavior. In the months after Chappaquiddick, he had sat on the sidelines as Sen. Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, and other liberals led the successful opposition to two of Richard Nixon’s Supreme Court nominees — federal judges Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, two Southerners whose speeches and rulings showed them as defenders of the South’s white supremacist order.\n Kennedy’s “moral armor was in bad repair,” wrote newsman William Eaton, who would win a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the nomination. “This was right after Chappaquiddick,” Jason Berman, an aide to Bayh, said when I spoke to him. “You can understand, if you were going to make the fight on grounds of ethics and morality, why Teddy would not have been the best candidate.”\n A few months later, his colleagues in the Democratic caucus dumped Kennedy, whom they had elevated to lead them in battle against the wily and formidable Nixon, from his job as Senate whip.\n “He took us with him over that bridge,” said Sen. Walter Mondale, the liberal Democrat from Minnesota, “because he was sort of our star.” The Senate Democrats replaced Kennedy with the more conservative Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. “It was a huge humiliation within the Senate — a very personal thing that happened to him that senators rarely do to each other,” Mondale said. “Chappaquiddick got him.”\n \n  \n But it is not until now, with the quiet return of a Senate Judiciary Committee’s file on Watergate to its rightful place in the National Archives, that this new story can be told.\n The Watergate file had been wrongly withheld from historians and biographers with Kennedy’s papers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, instead of at the Archives, where Senate committee records are supposed to be kept. It reappeared in the Judiciary committee files after Kennedy’s death. I came upon it in my research for a new biography, Ted Kennedy: A Life\",\"link\":{\"target\":\"NEW\",\"attributes\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565873/ted-kennedy-by-john-a-farrell/\",\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc07b0000\",\"_type\":\"33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df\"},\"_id\":\"00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc07b0001\",\"_type\":\"02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266\"}\">Ted Kennedy: A Life, from which this article is adapted.\n The documents tell of 1972, a time when Nixon was riding high, having made his world-jolting trip to China — and following it up by joining Soviet leaders at a momentous summit, for the signing of arms control treaties, in Moscow.\n But the president — who gnawed on the belief that the Kennedy clan had stolen the 1960 election from him — was possessed with the fear that they would do it again, with Ted Kennedy as a candidate, in 1972.\n “Nixon was mesmerized by Ted Kennedy. Even after Chappaquiddick,” Tom Korologos, who lobbied for the administration on Capitol Hill, told me. “The Kennedys had screwed him in 1960. He had a syndrome. He didn’t want it to happen again. He was paranoid. Really. Paranoid.”\n Nixon pressed his staff for dirt on Kennedy and other Democrats. In May of 1971, he had ordered them to proceed with a campaign of bugging and surveillance. “I want, Bob, more use of wiretapping,” he told his chief of staff, H.R. “Bob” Haldeman. “Kennedy… Maybe we can get a real scandal on any one of the leading Democrats.”\n The president’s men picked up the pace, with schemes to wreak havoc at the Democratic national convention in Miami, to break into McGovern’s headquarters and to bug Democratic headquarters at the Watergate office building. On June 17, at the Watergate, a team of Nixon’s burglars got caught.\n \n  \n Watergate was a self-inflicted wound by Nixon. The Democratic convention was a catastrophe that summer — with scuffling between the New Left and vanquished party moderates, sophomoric liberal antics (there were votes to give Mao Zedong, Archie Bunker and Benjamin Spock the vice-presidential nomination) and a general lack of discipline that delayed McGovern’s acceptance speech until almost 3 a.m. “Only in Guam,” noted the campaign chronicler Theodore H. White, “was George McGovern speaking in prime time under the American flag.”\n And then bad turned to worse, as the vice-presidential candidate — Senator Joseph Eagleton of Missouri — was compelled to resign from the ticket for not disclosing hospitalizations, electric shock sessions and other mental health treatments he had undergone.\n Nixon’s own convention was superbly choreographed. He had browbeat the Federal Reserve into stoking the roaring economy. He was cutting a deal with the North Vietnamese that would doom the American ally, South Vietnam, in the long term but give Nixon something to boast about that fall. “Peace is at hand,” said his adviser, Henry Kissinger, in October.\n Through all this, the Watergate coverup continued. With perjury and payoffs, Nixon and his aides cloaked the president’s involvement. At the Washington Post, two young reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helped keep the story alive. Out of the public eye, the Post’s efforts were matched by one of Kennedy’s aides, the inestimable James Flug, that summer and fall.\n Kennedy had found how his family’s mystique lured the best and brightest to Washington and to his staff, and Flug was a premier example. Brooklyn-born and tough, he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and then from Harvard Law School. Kennedy kept a loose rein on his staff, Flug told me before his death in 2020, and he was given freedom to roam. He excelled, said a fellow aide, in taking Ted Kennedy into political thickets, from which the senator had to hack his way out.\n Watergate was the ultimate thicket. The vehicle was Kennedy’s little Judiciary subcommittee. In addition to a panel on refugees, and a Senate Labor subcommittee on health, he chaired an all-purpose toolbox with jurisdiction over the federal government’s administrative procedures and practices. Known as Ad Prac, its charter was basically anything that Ted Kennedy could convince the Judiciary chairman, James Eastland of Mississippi, to OK. “It was bottom-up work,” former staffer Thomas Susman said. Kennedy’s aides brought their groundwork to the boss. He then made the choice to join, or to skip, a scrap.\n Flug was the Ad Prac counsel. By mid-August, he was well-versed in the Watergate scandal and plugged into the network of lawyers, government accountants and investigators who were building a case against the president’s men. “Flug was finding connections and weaving patterns that were just sort of mind-boggling,” Kennedy would recall, in an oral history for the University of Virginia.\n Flug was one of the first congressional investigators to interview Alfred Baldwin, the Nixon hireling who monitored the Watergate wiretaps from a hotel across the street — and famously served as the lookout for the burglars on the night of the break-in. It is Baldwin who is immortalized in the opening scenes of the motion picture All the President’s Men, alerting his cohorts (“Base One to Unit One — we have some activity here…”) to the arrival of the police.\n Flug warned Kennedy, in a long August memo, that Nixon’s men were succeeding, via perjury and other means, at covering up the ties between the burglars, who were about to be indicted and brought to trial, and the White House.\n “The information in the indictments will probably not provide much real detail on the who, what or how of the plot,” Flug wrote. “The indictments will be better than nothing, (but) they will be of very limited utility in bringing out the whole story.”\n Meanwhile, the Democrats had chosen McGovern. Kennedy gave a rousing speech at the convention but turned McGovern down when asked to be his running mate. Kennedy’s family was worried about his safety, and he instinctively recoiled from the inconsequential duties of the office. “I am not cut out that way,” he told the Boston Globe. “The vice presidency is good for some people. However, I don’t need that kind of exposure.”\n \n  \n Performing a mitzvah for the party might have been a smart move. By declining to serve, Kennedy squandered an opportunity to be vetted and immunized, on a national stage, for his behavior at Chappaquiddick. “You do the penance, as they say, as a vice presidential candidate,” Boston Globe editor Robert Healy told White House aide Charles Colson, in a transcribed phone call. “You do the bit for the party and then in ’76 you have done it and because you’ve done it Chappaquiddick fades away. … I think that really makes some sense.”\n “That’s the one rationale,” Colson agreed.\n McGovern understood Kennedy’s reticence but bristled at the selfishness Kennedy displayed after declining the candidate’s offer. Like a wolf marking his territory, Kennedy blackballed McGovern’s second choice, Mayor Kevin White of Boston. If Kennedy wished to run for president himself someday, he did not see the sense in raising another Irish-Catholic from Massachusetts to national prominence. With cursory vetting, and the clock running, McGovern picked Eagleton instead.\n It was a disastrous start for McGovern’s fall campaign. Nixon had the economy on fire and a string of foreign policy successes to tout. Despite the Democratic nominee’s military record — as a bomber pilot, he flew 35 missions against the Nazis — Nixon portrayed him as an irresolute radical.\n \n McGovern’s opportunity to regain ground, it seemed, rested with the Watergate scandal. It “has become one of the major issues of the 1972 Presidential campaign,” an eight-page, single-spaced McGovern campaign memo to the nation’s editors and television producers declared rather hopefully on September 22. “Repeated Republican denials of complicity in the break-in have been met with repeated discoveries of evidence to the contrary.”\n In his own memo, Flug told Kennedy that the office was getting heat from the McGovern campaign. “They, of course, think this is the best thing they have going.”\n Kennedy faced a decision, similar to those he confronted in the Haynsworth and Carswell battles. Did he have the credibility, after Chappaquiddick, to launch a highly public investigation of corrupt acts by others? Would his presence distort the public’s perception of the crimes committed in Nixon’s name?\n “My natural inclination, like yours, is to go — it’s too meaty a thing to stay away from,” Flug urged his boss. “But for the same reason, it could backfire big and leave you looking like McGovern’s political hatchet man.”\n Kennedy’s choice was a topic of debate for years. Nixon and his aides would ultimately credit “the fine hand of the Kennedys” with the creation of the Senate Watergate Committee, the appointment of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, and the president’s slow and steady downfall. McGovern’s advisers, however, were just as agitated — filling the air with “unprintable expletives,” according to columnist Stewart Alsop — by what they perceived as Kennedy’s failure to act. Upon examination, McGovern may have had the better cause to complain.\n There were, to be sure, complications. To start, there was Kennedy’s proposed use of Ad Prac. Some in the Senate objected to his view of the panel as an unfettered hunting license and argued that a Watergate investigation would be better launched from a committee with clear jurisdiction like Government Operations. On the other hand, Kennedy had held hearings on the threat posed to civil liberties by wiretapping long before Watergate, and so had precedent on his side. Nor did other senators show an appetite in taking on Nixon. The relevant committees were in the hands of Southerners, aghast at McGovern’s liberal views and with no fierce desire to hand him the White House.\n A month before the election, the leading alternative — Senator Sam Ervin, who chaired Government Operations and a Judiciary subcommittee — took himself out of the running. Instead, he encouraged Kennedy to unmask the cover up with a televised public hearing — Kennedy vs. Nixon — that would guarantee blanket coverage and commentary. They had a prize catch in Baldwin, who could spin a gripping blow-by-blow account of the burglary, the bugging and the involvement of Nixon campaign officials. “I want to urge you to consider hearings,” Ervin said. It would be “a perfectly proper congressional inquiry into how the Justice Department is performing its obligation to the American people.”\n \n  \n As a dean of the Senate and a voice from the South, Ervin carried weight. He was “bad on civil rights,” but “incredibly good on civil liberties,” Kennedy would recall. Ervin’s imprimatur would keep peace in the Senate, but it led Kennedy to other questions: Would his investigation be deemed credible by the press and the voters? Could he lose more than he might win?\n Kennedy had Flug poll the clan. Calls went out to Burke Marshall and others from the late Robert Kennedy’s staff, to McGovern, and to Kennedy advisers David Burke, Richard Goodwin and Lawrence O’Brien. Attorney Edward Bennett Williams and his partner Joseph Califano, whose firm represented the Washington Post and the Democratic Party, were consulted. Kennedy’s allies on the subcommittee — Senators Phil Hart of Michigan, John Tunney of California, Bayh and North Dakota Sen. Quentin Burdick — were canvassed as well.\n On September 28, Flug sent Kennedy three memos. Written by different advisers — and signed only “X” and “Y” and “Z” to encourage candor — each outlined a course of action.\n The first memo, by “X,” gave the case for restraint. Putting Baldwin on the stand would be “a dramatic public proceeding of historic proportions,” X acknowledged. But it could make it impossible for the other Watergate burglars to get a fair trial. “Especially in the fields of justice and liberty, the most outrageous dimension of the Nixon Administration has been its constant readiness to sacrifice principles … (in favor of) short-run pragmatic expediency,” X wrote. “To fight such cynicism and opportunism by partaking of it ourselves would be hypocrisy of the first order.”\n Principle aside, there was politics to consider. Nixon would lash back — accusing Kennedy of trashing the defendants’ rights.\n “We would be playing in a rough league, and we would have to be prepared to play rough,” X wrote. Baldwin’s testimony would be one man’s story, and relied in part on hearsay. They needed more proof that the White House was involved or that “the fix is in” at the Justice Department. “Right now we don’t have it.”\n The second memo, from “Y,” gave the aggressive point of view, and was titled, “Why Ad Prac should announce Watergate Hearings Now.” Here was the case for a full-fledged assault before the election. “Even if Baldwin is our only witness, his story is one of ruthless lawlessness by employees of the (Nixon) Re-Election Committee,” Y wrote. They had a moral obligation to expose Nixon’s transgressions. “If we are going to stand quietly in the face of both a scandal of historic proportions and a politically motivated effort to … cover up that scandal until after Election Day, then we deserve the kind of government we are getting.”\n “It would be wise to be polite and say that the facts will come out in the course of the criminal trial,” wrote Y. “But the cruel truth is that the investigation has been in the hands of (Nixon administration) officials with the grossest kind of conflict of interest who delayed the indictment so that a pre-election trial would be impossible.”\n “This is a hearing that would be the biggest thing … and would get across to the public, in a way that even the trial itself won’t do, the enormity of the violations of laws and rights,” Y argued. “When a gross impropriety like the Watergate plot occurs, it is much more important to get to the heart of the matter, fix ultimate responsibility … and to assure that the whole process is cleansed.”\n The third memo, by “Z,” contained a cautionary, middle approach, outlining the path that Kennedy ultimately chose: to keep investigating, but to forego hearings. It was temperate, responsible — and timorous. To the considerable exasperation of McGovern’s presidential campaign, and some on his own staff, Kennedy chose not to give the voters a full account before the November election. “I don’t want a circus or to look like a headline hunter,” Kennedy told a reporter from National Journal.\n And so the moment passed. Americans would not hear before the election what Baldwin had to say: that Attorney General John Mitchell and other high-ranking Nixon administration officials were involved in the break-in, that McGovern headquarters had also been targeted for bugging, or how the cover-up began.\n \n  \n  \nBaldwin ultimately gave an interview to the Los Angeles Times, but it lacked the punch of a televised congressional hearing and faded from the public debate. Things seemed settled until, on October 10, Woodward and Bernstein disclosed that the Watergate break-in was but part of a widespread, well-funded campaign of political sabotage and espionage coordinated by White House officials.\n This gave Kennedy a second opportunity — a field of inquiry that would not threaten the defendants’ rights in the upcoming Watergate trial. His staff would launch a “preliminary inquiry,” Kennedy announced. Flug went back to work.\n Bernstein was invited to interview the senator. He found him guarded, cagey. “I know the people around Nixon,” Kennedy told him. “They are thugs.” But he had no illusions about what he could accomplish this late in the election. At best, his investigation would be a “holding action,” he said, to keep Nixon’s crew from destroying the evidence, and to keep some heat on those running the cover-up.\n Politically, there was “no percentage” in it, Kennedy confided to the reporter. The White House would go “with everything it had to smear him,” he said. He was vulnerable on Mary Jo Kopechne’s death and other “nickel-and-dime stuff.”\n Indeed, Nixon’s allies — Strom Thurmond, Barry Goldwater and Clare Boothe Luce — would soon raise Chappaquiddick anyway.\n “There is still that little truism which says people who live in glass houses should not throw stones,” Goldwater said. In an op-ed in the New York Times, Luce quoted the bumper sticker slogan: “Nobody was drowned at Watergate.”\n Flug was permitted to proceed. Subpoenas were issued. Bank records were collected. Kennedy’s staff ran down the head trickster, Donald Segretti, and the paymaster — Nixon’s personal lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach. But, once again, no hearings were held. At a climactic meeting with his staff in December, Kennedy decided to put off the confrontation.\n “Since the expected outcome was so uncertain, and the prospect of EMK falling on his face was so possible, no decision was made,” an internal office memo noted.\n At the White House, as Nixon’s secret taping system captured their remarks, the president and his men chortled. Kennedy was backing off, Haldeman told the pleased Nixon, because he had been compromised at Chappaquiddick.\n On Nixon’s birthday, in early January, his staff sent him a telegram. Allegedly from Kennedy, the “Director of Water Safety,” it invited Nixon to “a quiet weekend at Chappaquiddick” for a “homey family barbeque” and added, “P.S. Bring your bathing suit.”\n From the book TED KENNEDY: A Life, by John A. Farrell, published by Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

Issues such as abortion and transgender rights were at the center of the debate for evangelical Christians, who account for <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/news/2022-08-25/why-brazils-bolsonaro-is-courting-evangelicals-in-the-worlds-biggest-catholic-nation\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a third of Brazilians&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wlrn.org/news/2022-08-25/why-brazils-bolsonaro-is-courting-evangelicals-in-the-worlds-biggest-catholic-nation&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0b0000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0b0000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a third of Brazilians</a> and were among Bolsonaro’s strongest supporters. Evangelical churches had also actively campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018, and in return received tax exemptions, appointments to several ministries, the removal of LGBTQ protections from public guidelines and a pastor in the Supreme Court. It’s a replay of what happened in the United States: Evangelical Christians were instrumental in Trump’s 2016 election, and he then delivered a Supreme Court that overturned abortion rights.<br></p> <br> <p>In addition to the surprisingly high support for Bolsonaro, his far-right allies did tremendously well in the elections for Congress, consolidating their grip on the legislative process through an alliance that now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/right-wing-wins-brazils-congress-show-staying-power-bolsonarismo-2022-10-03/\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/right-wing-wins-brazils-congress-show-staying-power-bolsonarismo-2022-10-03/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0b0000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc0b0000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate</a>.

This political straitjacket will narrow the range of governmental action to bring welfare to the precarious majority. Government inaction would in turn increase popular discontent, eroding the legitimacy of social democratic forces in Brazil and preparing the ground for a stronger Bolsonarista comeback.</p> <p>The far right is also resurging in Italy, the EU’s third-biggest economy.</p> <p>For the past year and a half, Italy has been administered by a technocratic “national unity” government, which briefly brought together left-populist, center and far-right parties, and was led by Mario Draghi, the former governor of the European Central Bank. Giorgia Meloni’s party, Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy), which she co-founded in 2012 and that controlled just 4 percent of Parliament, was the only one in opposition. This hardline, uncompromising stance against the pro-EU technocratic government yielded fruits after the Draghi government collapsed in July.

Elections are, once again, bringing far-right nationalist leaders to power around the world. For decades, representative democracies have allowed for increasing accumulation of wealth at the top and growing precarity for the working classes — a fertile ground for the far right to capitalize on discontent.\n Far-right leaders are selling popular empowerment based on the discrimination and oppression of “the other”: immigrants, gender dissidents, feminists, religious minorities, left-wing “radicals,” the indigenous and the poor. Meanwhile, mainstream progressive governments have consistently failed to deliver broadly shared prosperity and economic security. It should not be so surprising then that people have ended up supporting a kind of politics that at least gives them symbolic power.\n The far right is currently ruling in: Hungary with Viktor Orbán, who has come out against race mixing in Europe and was a speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas this summer; Poland with the Christian nationalist party, Law and Justice, which opposes gay marriage, abortion and immigration; India, the most populous representative democracy in the world, with Narendra Modi, who has pursued Hindu-nationalist policies against religious minorities; Turkey with the imposition of Islamic nationalism and the ethnic cleansing against Kurds by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; Brazil with Jair Bolsonaro, who has denounced “homosexual fundamentalists,” called indigenous peoples “parasites” and advanced agribusiness by promoting the burning of the Amazon basin; and more recently, Italy with Giorgia Meloni, heir to Mussolini’s fascist legacy, the new prime minister after her right-wing coalition achieved a majority in Parliament.\n The current surge of MAGA Republicans running for Congress and Donald Trump’s likely 2024 bid to reclaim the White House are part of this trend.\n \n \n But to better understand the rise of the global far right, look to the two most recent elections involving Christian nationalist candidates: the presidential and congressional elections in Brazil and the parliamentary election in Italy. In both, far-right leaders have effectively appealed to ethnicity — particularly religion — and used largely unregulated social media platforms to amplify propaganda and “fake news” that further normalizes extreme ideas and the demand to establish discriminatory policies.\n The far right paved its way to power in Brazil, the largest Latin American economy, after launching attacks on the leaders of the ruling Workers’ Party (PT). In 2016, through lawfare — the misuse of rules and procedures as a political weapon — Congress impeached and removed President Dilma Rousseff on charges of accounting irregularities (which were later dismissed), and the courts prosecuted former President Lula da Silva on corruption charges in a trial that did not respect due process (and where the judge and lead prosecutor conspired to convict him so he could not run for president in 2018).\n After Lula was arrested, Bolsonaro, an ex-military officer who called Hitler “a great strategist” and believes Brazil is “a Christian country,” became the front runner and was elected in a runoff with 55 percent of the vote. Bolsonaro has spent the last four years in office divisively governing as the “Trump of the Tropics.”\n On Oct. 2, Bolsonaro faced a rematch with Lula, who was ultimately vindicated after wrongfully spending 548 days in prison. In the first round of the Brazilian presidential election, Lula came in first, with 48 percent of the vote — two points short of the majority to win outright. Bolsonaro, who had campaigned to “make Brazil great,” took second place with 43 percent of the vote — seven points more than any poll had forecasted.\n Perhaps the most important factor at the end of the campaign was the proliferation of fake news stating that Lula would persecute Christians and close churches if elected, which helped Bolsonaro lure centrist votes to his side.\n Bolsonaro constantly used religion on the trail as a cultural identity marker in a bid to re-impose eroded patriarchal hierarchies and traditions. Issues such as abortion and transgender rights were at the center of the debate for evangelical Christians, who account for a third of Brazilians and were among Bolsonaro’s strongest supporters. Evangelical churches had also actively campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018, and in return received tax exemptions, appointments to several ministries, the removal of LGBTQ protections from public guidelines and a pastor in the Supreme Court. It’s a replay of what happened in the United States: Evangelical Christians were instrumental in Trump’s 2016 election, and he then delivered a Supreme Court that overturned abortion rights.\n \n In addition to the surprisingly high support for Bolsonaro, his far-right allies did tremendously well in the elections for Congress, consolidating their grip on the legislative process through an alliance that now controls half of the lower chamber and is only one seat away from a majority in the Senate. More than a third of the lower house and 10 percent of the Senate are controlled by the Evangelical Parliamentary Front.\n This means that even if Lula defeats Bolsonaro in the runoff election on Oct. 30, he will have to deal with an aggressive conservative Congress, willing to block legislation and impeach him and his ministers. This political straitjacket will narrow the range of governmental action to bring welfare to the precarious majority. Government inaction would in turn increase popular discontent, eroding the legitimacy of social democratic forces in Brazil and preparing the ground for a stronger Bolsonarista comeback.\n The far right is also resurging in Italy, the EU’s third-biggest economy.\n For the past year and a half, Italy has been administered by a technocratic “national unity” government, which briefly brought together left-populist, center and far-right parties, and was led by Mario Draghi, the former governor of the European Central Bank. Giorgia Meloni’s party, Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy), which she co-founded in 2012 and that controlled just 4 percent of Parliament, was the only one in opposition. This hardline, uncompromising stance against the pro-EU technocratic government yielded fruits after the Draghi government collapsed in July. In the recent snap election, Meloni campaigned with the slogan “Italy and Italians first!” and her coalition, which includes the far-right Lega Nord as well as Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party Forza Italia, achieved 44 percent of the vote. Brothers of Italy was the most voted party in Parliament with 26 percent, which paved the way for Meloni to become the first female prime minister of Italy.\n \n Brothers of Italy is the successor of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), which was active but marginal until 1995. In addition to occupying the same headquarters as MSI in Rome and using its central symbol, the tricolor flame, Brothers of Italy follow closely the 1926 fascist doctrine to protect the “State, family, morality and the economy.” Meloni, a Christian nationalist who praised Mussolini when she was younger, has promised to “defend God, country, and family.” Her rhetoric comes straight from the far-right playbook. She has proposed a naval blockade against migrants (a measure that was declared a violation of human rights by the European Court of Human Rights in 2012), to “protect human life from conception” (abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978 and has been reaffirmed in two national referendums) and to cut taxes. In a speech in a meeting with the Spanish far-right party Vox in June, she laid out the principles of her neo-fascist ideology: “yes to the natural family … no to gender ideology … yes to the universality of the Cross … no to mass immigration, yes to jobs for our citizens, no to international finance.”\n Meloni’s victory is partially due to anti-establishment sentiments after the failure of successive governments to improve living conditions, as well as to the spreading of fake news that appealed to people’s fear of “the other.” On the campaign trail, immigration was a hot topic and voters were bombarded with xenophobic posts and manipulated content. In the days leading up to the vote, fake videos and images of alleged immigrants beating up or abusing people were pumped through Facebook and Twitter, further tilting the scales.\n The far right is today a transnational network, so it is not surprising that similar tactics to lure people into a sense of empowerment based on the oppression of others are now at work in American politics.\n Moreover, the Biden administration has not substantially improved the living conditions of the majority in the face of stiff conservative resistance and its own reluctance to act boldly. An economy marked by high inflation has people in a sour mood that could lead to a Democratic wipeout in the midterms. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve seems increasingly eager to fuel a recession, meaning things could get even worse for ordinary Americans.\n With fear and anxiety about their livelihoods and positions in society, people are more likely to turn to Trumpism and its Christian nationalist politics.

It was the tightest presidential race since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985 and marks the first time Bolsonaro has lost an election in his 34-year political career, including seven races for a seat in Congress’ Lower House.</p> <p>Much like former U.S. President Donald Trump, whom Bolsonaro openly admires, the far-right incumbent has repeatedly questioned the reliability of the country’s electoral system, claiming electronic voting machines are prone to fraud. He never provided any proof, even when ordered to do so by the electoral court.<br></p> <br><iframe style=\"max-width: 100%\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6314683427112\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br> <p>That has led many political analysts to warn that Bolsonaro appeared to be laying the groundwork to reject election results.</p> <p>In recent days, and without a public statement from Bolsonaro, truck drivers and other supporters of his blocked hundreds of roads across the country. Many said the election had been fraudulent and some called for military intervention and for Congress and the Supreme Court to be disbanded.</p> <p>Earlier Tuesday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the federal highway police to immediately clear the roads.</p> <p>A majority of the court's justices backed the decision, which accuses the highway police of “omission and inertia.\" Failure to comply will mean its director can be fined up to 100,000 reais (more than $19,000) per hour, be removed from his duties and even face arrest. Federal prosecutors in Sao Paulo and Goias states said they had opened investigations into the blockades.</p> <p>By noon Tuesday, highway police said they had removed 306 blockades, but more than 260 were still in place.</p> <p>“There is no doubt that, even though he might not be directly responsible for these actions, everything he has done as president stoked this, especially questioning the electoral process and the ballots,” said Williams Gonçalves, a political science professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>\"Bolsonaro is completely isolated. Everyone responsible for other institutions has already recognized the election’s results,” Gonçalves said.</p> <p>In Sao Paulo — Brazil’s most populous state and largest economy — traffic jams around the international airport led to dozens of flight cancellations, with videos on social media showing travelers rolling their suitcases along the highway in the dark trying to catch their flights. The highways had been cleared by Tuesday morning, but airport officials said access remained difficult as traffic was still backed up in and out of the airport.</p> <p>There, Dalmir Almeida, a 38-year-old protester, told The Associated Press that after completing three days of strikes, he and others will drive their trucks to the military barracks to ask for their support. “The army will be in our favor,” he added.</p> <p>At another road block in Sao Paulo state, protesters set tires on fire. Several demonstrators were wrapped in the Brazilian flag, which has been co-opted by the nation’s conservative movement for demonstrations. Huge lines of cars could be seen snaking along the highway.</p> <p>Fears of escalation grew as the country's leftist Landless Workers’ Movement, a key ally of da Silva’s that has long staged occupations of what it considers vacant or unused lands, asked its militants on Tuesday to organize demonstrations in several states to unblock roads.</p> <p>Sao Paulo Gov. Rodrigo Garcia told a news conference that the time for negotiations was over, and he was not ruling out the use of force by law enforcement.</p> <p>“From now on, we are going to apply what the (Supreme Court) decision determined, starting with fines of 100,000 reais per hour for each vehicle that is contributing to this obstruction,\" he said.</p> <p>In Minas Gerais, a key battleground state in the election, a video on social media showed a protester telling a reporter from the O Tempo news outlet that the election was “fraudulent” and warned of future protests. “We won’t stop as long as we don’t have a response from our president,” he said. “We want Bolsonaro in 2023 and for the years to come.\"</p> <p>In Itaborai, a region in Rio de Janeiro state, an Associated Press reporter saw truck drivers kneeling in front of police officers and refusing to evacuate.</p> <p>Users on social media, including in multiple Telegram and WhatsApp chat groups with names like “Paralysation,\" shared demands that the military take the streets, or that Congress and the Supreme Court be disbanded and the president remain in office.</p> <p>Following the election, the electoral authority blocked two dozen Telegram groups that defended a military coup and called on their more than 150,000 followers to organize demonstrations, according to online news site UOL.</p> <p>The Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday permits regular state police forces to reinforce federal highway police, and the governors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo states ordered them to deploy, news outlets reported. The same was done in 2018, when an 11-day trucker strike <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/052b249118d64ca58e2fa230fa961c2f\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;brought Brazil to a halt.&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/052b249118d64ca58e2fa230fa961c2f&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc05b0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-361a-dd2e-a3dd-7fbfc05b0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">brought Brazil to a halt.</a></p> <p>Bolsonaro commands wide support from the police forces' rank and file, however, and it wasn’t clear how effective their involvement would be. Da Silva’s Workers’ Party had accused Bolsonaro’s campaign of deploying law enforcement to create traffic jams and deter people from voting on Election Day, and video footage shared on social media showed officials stopping buses.</p> <p>Alexandre de Moraes, who presides over the the nation’s electoral authority, said police checkpoints delayed voters, but didn't stop them from reaching the polls.</p> <p>The 2018 stoppage caused food prices to spike and left supermarket shelves without products as gas stations ran out of fuel.

It was the tightest presidential race since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985 and marks the first time Bolsonaro has lost an election in his 34-year political career, including seven races for a seat in Congress’ Lower House.\n Much like former U.S. President Donald Trump, whom Bolsonaro openly admires, the far-right incumbent has repeatedly questioned the reliability of the country’s electoral system, claiming electronic voting machines are prone to fraud. He never provided any proof, even when ordered to do so by the electoral court.\n \n \n That has led many political analysts to warn that Bolsonaro appeared to be laying the groundwork to reject election results.\n In recent days, and without a public statement from Bolsonaro, truck drivers and other supporters of his blocked hundreds of roads across the country. Many said the election had been fraudulent and some called for military intervention and for Congress and the Supreme Court to be disbanded.\n Earlier Tuesday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the federal highway police to immediately clear the roads.\n A majority of the court's justices backed the decision, which accuses the highway police of “omission and inertia.\" Failure to comply will mean its director can be fined up to 100,000 reais (more than $19,000) per hour, be removed from his duties and even face arrest. Federal prosecutors in Sao Paulo and Goias states said they had opened investigations into the blockades.\n By noon Tuesday, highway police said they had removed 306 blockades, but more than 260 were still in place.\n “There is no doubt that, even though he might not be directly responsible for these actions, everything he has done as president stoked this, especially questioning the electoral process and the ballots,” said Williams Gonçalves, a political science professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n \"Bolsonaro is completely isolated. Everyone responsible for other institutions has already recognized the election’s results,” Gonçalves said.\n In Sao Paulo — Brazil’s most populous state and largest economy — traffic jams around the international airport led to dozens of flight cancellations, with videos on social media showing travelers rolling their suitcases along the highway in the dark trying to catch their flights. The highways had been cleared by Tuesday morning, but airport officials said access remained difficult as traffic was still backed up in and out of the airport.\n There, Dalmir Almeida, a 38-year-old protester, told The Associated Press that after completing three days of strikes, he and others will drive their trucks to the military barracks to ask for their support. “The army will be in our favor,” he added.\n At another road block in Sao Paulo state, protesters set tires on fire. Several demonstrators were wrapped in the Brazilian flag, which has been co-opted by the nation’s conservative movement for demonstrations. Huge lines of cars could be seen snaking along the highway.\n Fears of escalation grew as the country's leftist Landless Workers’ Movement, a key ally of da Silva’s that has long staged occupations of what it considers vacant or unused lands, asked its militants on Tuesday to organize demonstrations in several states to unblock roads.\n Sao Paulo Gov. Rodrigo Garcia told a news conference that the time for negotiations was over, and he was not ruling out the use of force by law enforcement.\n “From now on, we are going to apply what the (Supreme Court) decision determined, starting with fines of 100,000 reais per hour for each vehicle that is contributing to this obstruction,\" he said.\n In Minas Gerais, a key battleground state in the election, a video on social media showed a protester telling a reporter from the O Tempo news outlet that the election was “fraudulent” and warned of future protests. “We won’t stop as long as we don’t have a response from our president,” he said. “We want Bolsonaro in 2023 and for the years to come.\"\n In Itaborai, a region in Rio de Janeiro state, an Associated Press reporter saw truck drivers kneeling in front of police officers and refusing to evacuate.\n Users on social media, including in multiple Telegram and WhatsApp chat groups with names like “Paralysation,\" shared demands that the military take the streets, or that Congress and the Supreme Court be disbanded and the president remain in office.\n Following the election, the electoral authority blocked two dozen Telegram groups that defended a military coup and called on their more than 150,000 followers to organize demonstrations, according to online news site UOL.\n The Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday permits regular state police forces to reinforce federal highway police, and the governors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo states ordered them to deploy, news outlets reported. The same was done in 2018, when an 11-day trucker strike brought Brazil to a halt.\n Bolsonaro commands wide support from the police forces' rank and file, however, and it wasn’t clear how effective their involvement would be. Da Silva’s Workers’ Party had accused Bolsonaro’s campaign of deploying law enforcement to create traffic jams and deter people from voting on Election Day, and video footage shared on social media showed officials stopping buses.\n Alexandre de Moraes, who presides over the the nation’s electoral authority, said police checkpoints delayed voters, but didn't stop them from reaching the polls.\n The 2018 stoppage caused food prices to spike and left supermarket shelves without products as gas stations ran out of fuel. It caused billions in losses and revealed the vast power that truckers possess, particularly when they organize through social media platforms.\n Bolsonaro, a lawmaker at the time and months away from winning that year's presidential election, was an outspoken supporter of the truckers, who are now among his constituents. This year, his administration limited interstate fuel taxes to help bring down prices and launched a financial aid program for truckers just months before the election.\n On Tuesday, dozens of journalists from both national and international news outlets remained camped outside the presidential residence in the capital, Brasilia, awaiting any sign that Bolsonaro might speak about the election or the highway blockades.\n “Bolsonaro’s strategy here, so far as there is one, seems to be strategic ambiguity,\" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of Igarapé Institute, a Rio de Janeiro-based think tank focused on security. “He’s focused on the street, and if chaos ensues so much the better.

Warren’s allies said they expect public sector labor unions, some of which have clashed with Raimondo for years, to try to steer the president away from her for the Treasury job once Yellen’s fate becomes clearer.</p> <p>Progressives say they don't want a return to fights over Wall Street regulation and stimulus-spending policies that prevailed during the Obama administration — and where liberals were often on the losing side.</p> <p>“The Obama economic team focused too much on trying to placate elites and too little on trying to understand the economic pain and anger coursing through the country, and that combination helped fuel right-wing populism,” said Dan Geldon, a consultant and former chief of staff to Warren. “A lot of insiders like Raimondo. But putting her at Treasury risks that same dynamic heading into 2024.”</p> <p>The possible choice of a new Treasury secretary poses a major dilemma for the White House, which has maintained detente with the Warren-led progressive wing. With a possible recession looming and the GOP ready to make gains on Capitol Hill, choosing Raimondo — a former Rhode Island governor and venture capitalist — could signal that Biden wants a moderate, politically minded Treasury boss with ties to both Republicans and Wall Street.</p> <p>Yellen, a preeminent academic economist and onetime Federal Reserve chair, has not relished being pressed into the political arena, where she has drawn flak from Republicans over spiraling inflation and Biden's spending policies. But she says she plans to stay on as secretary. </p> <p>Raimondo, despite criticism from the left, has championed Biden’s new industrial policies like the <a href=\"https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_116_HR_7178\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667149926252,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-843d-d1d1-a57f-d53f02e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667149926252,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-843d-d1d1-a57f-d53f02e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_116_HR_7178&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-29e1-d3a9-afb4-6de3078a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;CHIPS for America Act&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-29e1-d3a9-afb4-6de3078a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">CHIPS for America Act</a> and <a href=\"https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_5376\" target=\"_blank\" link-data=\"{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1667149867582,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-843d-d1d1-a57f-d53f02e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1667149867582,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-843d-d1d1-a57f-d53f02e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_5376&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-29e0-ddd7-afd7-3ff0231c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Inflation Reduction Act&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-29e0-ddd7-afd7-3ff0231c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.

They're already lining up against a potential successor.\n Key players on the Democratic Party’s left flank are poised to oppose Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a business-friendly contender who has a close relationship with President Joe Biden and is favored by many in the White House to take the position if Yellen leaves, as some officials expect.\n Yellen, whose departure has been the subject of speculation for months, has been sidelined on a number of key policy issues by the White House, and a potential shift in power on Capitol Hill could lead to nasty fights over the federal debt limit and other issues, giving her reason to want to exit, according to people familiar with the situation.\n Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other progressive lawmakers are maintaining pressure on Raimondo in letters criticizing her employment of big technology alumni at Commerce and her remarks on tech regulation, among other complaints. Warren’s allies said they expect public sector labor unions, some of which have clashed with Raimondo for years, to try to steer the president away from her for the Treasury job once Yellen’s fate becomes clearer.\n Progressives say they don't want a return to fights over Wall Street regulation and stimulus-spending policies that prevailed during the Obama administration — and where liberals were often on the losing side.\n “The Obama economic team focused too much on trying to placate elites and too little on trying to understand the economic pain and anger coursing through the country, and that combination helped fuel right-wing populism,” said Dan Geldon, a consultant and former chief of staff to Warren. “A lot of insiders like Raimondo. But putting her at Treasury risks that same dynamic heading into 2024.”\n The possible choice of a new Treasury secretary poses a major dilemma for the White House, which has maintained detente with the Warren-led progressive wing. With a possible recession looming and the GOP ready to make gains on Capitol Hill, choosing Raimondo — a former Rhode Island governor and venture capitalist — could signal that Biden wants a moderate, politically minded Treasury boss with ties to both Republicans and Wall Street.\n Yellen, a preeminent academic economist and onetime Federal Reserve chair, has not relished being pressed into the political arena, where she has drawn flak from Republicans over spiraling inflation and Biden's spending policies. But she says she plans to stay on as secretary. \n Raimondo, despite criticism from the left, has championed Biden’s new industrial policies like the CHIPS for America Act and Inflation Reduction Act. Together, those laws contain hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for domestic manufacturing, a progressive priority.\n Said a Commerce Department spokesperson: “She negotiated bipartisan provisions to expand affordable internet to all households, she was an essential negotiator for the bipartisan CHIPS bill” and is “a forceful proponent of President Biden’s message against trickle-down economics.”\n But some progressives say Raimondo is too close to corporate leaders and helps them shape policies in forums like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a pact that Biden founded as a counterweight to China where they fear she will try to curb efforts to regulate American tech giants. They distrust her on tariffs, saying she failed to do more to prevent Biden from waiving penalties on solar imports in June, even though that undermined her own agency’s trade authority. And they object to her track record in Rhode Island, where they say she moved to cut the pensions guaranteed to public employees like firefighters and teachers to pay for other programs.\n “I don’t buy it,” Lori Wallach, a trade activist, said of Raimondo’s progressive economic rhetoric.\n “In numerous forums, Secretary Raimondo and her staff pushed the agenda of big tech to rig trade agreements in their favor,” Wallach said. \n Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a group that seeks to expose corporate influence in government, and author of a recent blog post attacking the former governor's policies, said: “Raimondo's record as a financier and in Rhode Island politics is very much at odds with the modern Democratic Party. On issues such as trade, financial regulation, and tax collection, key elements of the Democratic coalition are likely to balk at the idea of a Treasury Secretary Raimondo.\"\n Raimondo, Yellen and Warren all declined to comment for this story.\n Yellen has surprised supporters by wielding less clout in the West Wing than her recent predecessors did, according to people familiar with the matter.

Nor do they believe they could forestall confirmation, given that she would likely win a number of GOP votes.\n Their larger point is that while the White House has kept Warren on its side and picked several important financial services regulators and senior White House staff from her world, choosing Raimondo for Treasury would be seen as a shift to the middle.\n Raimondo’s record, while troubling to the left, has earned her high praise among business executives.\n “Secretary Raimondo has a passion for achieving results,” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an interview. “Working with her on small business initiatives, before and during the pandemic, I am always struck by her relentless drive, her thoughtful pragmatism and skill in working with people.”\n Yet Helen Brosnan, executive director of Fight Corporate Monopolies, another group that monitors corporate influence in government, argued that Raimondo has often given priority to “powerful CEOs over working people.”\n Brosnan said her group was not pushing any specific alternative to Raimondo should Yellen leave. “We are just on high alert to be in opposition to any folks like her.\"","dc:creator":"Ben White and Gavin Bade","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/c2/39/9de6c9c4467488dcf3cee5068c82/ap22255775612261.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Pool photo by Raquel Cunha","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Progressive lawmakers are maintaining pressure on Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in letters criticizing her employment of big tech alumni and her remarks on tech regulation, among other complaints.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/c2/39/9de6c9c4467488dcf3cee5068c82/ap22255775612261.jpg"}}]},"content":"Elizabeth Warren's allies are already poised to oppose Biden's next potential Treasury secretary pick.","contentSnippet":"Elizabeth Warren's allies are already poised to oppose Biden's next potential Treasury secretary pick.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/31/the-warren-led-left-lines-up-against-raimondo-for-treasury-00063682","isoDate":"2022-10-31T08:31:00.000Z"},{"creator":"Noah Goldberg","title":"Powerball ticket worth $790,000 sold in Los Angeles as jackpot climbs to $1.2 billion","link":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-01/powerball-ticket-worth-790-000-sold-in-los-angeles-as-jackpot-climbs-to-1-2-billion","pubDate":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 17:01:37 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Powerball jackpot climbs to $1.2 billion; L.A. lottery player won $790,000 Monday for matching five of the six numbers</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Powerball jackpot climbs to $1.2 billion; L.A. lottery player won $790,000 Monday for matching five of the six numbers","dc:creator":"Noah Goldberg","media:content":{"$":{"url":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0669aee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1500x1000!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F68%2Ff276ffa44cd8ba3eec3ace952303%2Fpowerball-one-billion-ap22304778560688.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},"media:description":[{"_":"People line up to purchase lottery tickets for the drawing of the Powerball lottery at the Blue Bird Liquor store in Hawthorne, Calif., Monday, Oct. 31, 2022.

These states are killing America's golden goose — free markets — simply because the market doesn't agree with their ideology.”</p> <p><i>Zachary Warmbrodt contributed to this story.</i></p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"The country’s largest financial firms are bracing for a fresh wave of attacks on their sustainable investing efforts after the midterm elections — especially if Republicans take control of one or both houses of Congress.\n The biggest push to discourage banks and asset managers from considering environmental, social and governance factors in making financial decisions — and the biggest headache for Wall Street — will continue to come from GOP state officials who have been cutting business ties with firms they say are discriminating against fossil fuel companies in service to a “woke” agenda.\n Republicans are planning to build on the momentum they've established in states like Texas, Louisiana and West Virginia, where officials have pulled millions of dollars out of BlackRock Inc. and other financial firms. Financial officer candidates in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and Kansas have taken positions on ESG that have polarized races that seldom see political drama.\n “This is going to escalate,” said West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore, a Republican leading a coalition of 15 state treasurers working to punish financial firms they say are boycotting fossil fuels. “We are going full throttle once we get into 2023. We are going to see a lot more movement on this at the state level. You’re really going to start to reach critical mass as it relates to assets under management and capital that can be leveraged against the ESG movement.”\n BlackRock and other big financial firms have long faced attacks from environmental activists over their refusal to divest from oil and gas companies, but they have been caught off guard by the wave of hostility from a political party that has long been viewed as an ally. And the fact that the attacks are coming even as they continue to be major supporters of the fossil fuel industry suggests that the fight is more about politics than money.\n \n \n In Congress, House Republicans will focus on ESG if the party wins a majority, said Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and the Republican Study Committee. That would mean more aggressive oversight of the SEC’s proposed climate disclosure rule and the emphasis on climate risk at the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators.\n “BlackRock and State Street and Vanguard and Invesco and Fidelity — these are great companies,\" Barr said in an interview. \"All we want is for them to live up to their history of being great American companies and achieving retirement security for Americans and stop this nonsense of politicizing capital allocation through ESG.”\n The asset management firms — which have a fiduciary duty to seek the best returns for their clients — say they're responding to investor demand for information on potential risks from climate change and other business threats.\n Perhaps there’s no more famous example of the embrace of ESG than when BlackRock CEO Larry Fink declared in 2020 that “climate risk is investment risk.” But Republican financial officers are preparing to wield public coffers more broadly to discourage what they claim is political meddling.\n Arizona Treasurer Kimberly Yee (R) pulled state funding from Ben & Jerry's parent Unilever last year after the ice cream maker stopped doing business in Israel. She said she plans to carry out her office’s new investment policy against ESG if reelected, and the issue was the central focus of her debate with challenger Martín Quezada, a Democratic state senator.\n “I’ll continue to fight against a political agenda that takes away the foundation of a free market,” Yee said in an interview. “We can’t play around with the taxpayer dollars. ESG policies are going down a dangerous path because they put politics over a financial scorecard.”\n The anti-ESG campaign isn’t posing an existential threat for major financial firms. Louisiana’s withdrawal of $794 million from BlackRock, by far the most of any state, is but a blip on the bottom line of the world’s biggest asset manager, which had $8.5 trillion under management as of June 30. And many of the divestments don’t include public pension funds, the biggest chunk of capital overseen by states.\n But that isn’t stopping the companies from fighting back. BlackRock has launched a nationwide ad campaign and created a webpage highlighting its approach to energy investments and climate, noting that it continues to invest more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies and $310 billion in energy firms worldwide.\n “We are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives that sacrifice pension plans’ access to high-quality investments — and thereby jeopardize pensioners’ financial returns,” BlackRock wrote in response to state attorneys general questioning the company's commitment to achieving the best return for clients.\n The contention that taxpayer and employee money is being put at risk is backed by a study done by University of Pennsylvania finance professor Daniel Garrett, who found that Texas entities will pay an additional $303 million to $532 million in interest on the $32 billion in borrowing done in the first eight months after the implementation of two laws that bar municipalities from contracting with banks that restrict funding to oil, gas or firearm companies.\n “The sad part is that the citizens of red states will pay the price for the political theater in excessive interest rates for their bonds and high risk for their pension nest eggs,” said Andrew Behar, the CEO of As You Sow, a nonprofit shareholder advocacy group. “Any state treasurer who is running on anti-risk-assessment is declaring that they do not intend to do their job.”\n Backers of the anti-ESG push, meanwhile, are looking to state legislatures to provide more authority for treasurers and comptrollers. Will Hild is executive director of Consumers Research, a nonprofit that backs a group of Republican state treasurers that oppose ESG financing. He said in an interview that he expects 12 to 20 states to consider legislation targeting financial firms’ ESG approaches in the next six to nine months.\n Such bills could limit pension fund managers to only considering financial returns in their decision-making, similar to what Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) did in Florida. States also could take up “energy boycott” legislation, similar to laws in Texas, Kentucky, Oklahomaand West Virginia that require state agencies to divest from companies accused of boycotting fossil fuels.\n The Heartland Institute, a nonprofit that denies mainstream climate science, names South Dakota, Mississippi and Nebraska as likely states for new anti-ESG action. The energy boycott bill, a draft model policy at the American Legislative Exchange Council, has already been introduced in recent legislative sessions in states including Idaho and Indiana.\n West Virginia's Moore said state and federal officials might consider whether companies are committing antitrust violations by collaborating on “net-zero” and ESG policies, pointing to Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, as a prime example. They’ve already targeted banks’ involvement in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led, U.N.-backed group that is committed to reaching net-zero in their lending and investment portfolios by 2050.\n The financial sector will weather the storm, but the impact on taxpayers remains to be seen.\n “It is a disaster for our markets when politicians demand that financial institutions ignore whole classes of risk and opportunity because they don't align with their ideology,” said Dave Wallack, executive director of the nonprofit For The Long Term, which advocates for treasurers to support their beneficiaries. “It is even worse still when they install blacklists and create fear in the market.

Ahead of the 2010 tea party wave election that swept the GOP to the House majority, the Republican National Committee remade its website with a \"Fire Pelosi\" theme that depicted her in flames. Even from the minority in 2018, she starred in dozens of GOP spots that sought to link her to vulnerable Democratic candidates.\n And that hasn’t changed in what could be her final year leading the caucus. Less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Pelosi remains a fixture in Republican attack ads airing in districts from Montana to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania. Many of the ads cast her as the “liberal elite,” criticizing her for “lying” or working with Biden to “destroy” the country.\n “Biden and Pelosi are breaking our country,” the narrator reads in a House GOP ad promoting their candidate, Ryan Zinke, in Montana’s newly created 2nd District. Another ad from the House GOP campaign arm blasted Democratic candidate Eric Sorensen in Illinois for being “in Pelosi’s pocket” and “in lockstep with her costly liberal agenda.”\n However, the GOP’s laser focus on Pelosi, while hardly a new phenomenon, is drawing new criticism in the wake of the violent assault on her husband early Friday morning. The assailant, whose online activity was steeped in conspiracy and baseless allegations about the 2020 election, had been specifically searching for the speaker, according to law enforcement officials — calling out “Where’s Nancy?\"\n \"Yesterday morning, a violent man broke into our family home, demanded to confront me and brutally attacked my husband Paul. Our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack on our Pop. We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to House colleagues Saturday evening. \n For Rep. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat and longtime Pelosi ally who is a survivor of political violence, the fault lies unmistakably with Trump, who “hasn’t let up in the vitriol he spews out” and has ceaselessly assailed Pelosi as “crazy,” “corrupt” or the embodiment of Democratic wrongdoing.\n “There’s no question looking at his social media that he was radicalized online” and “is a classic convert to the very Trumpian, very dangerous philosophy of taking people out that aren’t like them,” Speier said of DePape during a phone interview.\n “The frightening part of all this is we identify the people who have taken action — who have written, who have called, who have stalked,” Speier added. “It’s the people that harbor the same horrific positions that have yet to be identified, like the man who attacked Paul Pelosi.”\n Hillary Clinton, no stranger to Pelosi's mantle as GOP target, tweeted Saturday: \"The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.\"\n \n \n An array of top Republicans has sharply condemned the Pelosi home invasion, making clear that it was unacceptable criminal behavior. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has traveled the country campaigning for House Republicans, said: “We can have our political differences, but violence is always wrong & unacceptable.”\n But as Democratic lawmakers decry GOP political rhetoric with a new fierceness, the attack on Paul Pelosi is becoming the latest inflection point in an American political discourse that's grown exponentially coarser since Republicans first embraced Nancy Pelosi as an attack-ad bogeywoman. While both parties regularly demonize their opponents in campaign messaging — Democrats slamming former President Donald Trump, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — the speaker has occupied an arguably unique position.\n Greene, for one, got stripped of her committee assignments by Democrats last year after social media posts surfaced showing the Georgia Republican liking a Facebook comment that called for Pelosi’s assassination.\n Pelosi’s fellow Democrats insist that the focus on her goes too far in a political world now defined by the Jan. 6 Capitol siege by Trump supporters. Rioters that day also chanted Pelosi's name as they walked through the building they had invaded, and some eventually ransacked her office. It was later reported that some of those who broke into the Capitol that day had intended to seriously harm the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency.\n The attack horrified California state senator Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, but he said it was “completely and utterly predictable” given the endless demonization of Pelosi by Republican politicians, conservative media and social media trolls.\n “We have an entire right-wing machine dedicated to promoting conspiracy theories, to brainwashing people, and to directing their anger towards specific leaders including Nancy Pelosi,” Wiener said. “That machine led directly to this attack.”\n Wiener added that he has faced intensifying acrimony in recent years, including a death threat specific enough that the man making it was convicted of multiple felonies last month. He attributed that to the “mass delusion” of election denial and to proliferating online toxicity that has seeped into the Republican Party.\n “QAnon doesn’t necessarily exist anymore, but QAnon is now part of the DNA of the Republican Party,” Wiener said. “The big establishment forces in the Republican Party,” he added, “they created this monster.”\n Democrats have already emphasized what they call rising, dangerous GOP extremism in some of their own hotly contested midterm races. The House Democratic campaign arm has centered its message on so-called pro-Trump “MAGA Republicans,” pointing to candidates who have supported right-wing conspiracy theories or showed up for at least some of the Jan. 6 events designed to protest congressional certification of Trump's loss.\n White reported from San Francisco.","dc:creator":"Sarah Ferris and Jeremy B.

However, even a small number of ballots could be significant if contests are close in the state next week.\n So far, over 900,000 mail ballots have been returned in the state, according to data compiled by the United States Elections Project. Of those, over 70 percent have come from voters registered as Democrats.","dc:creator":"Zach Montellaro","media:content":{"$":{"type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://static.politico.com/d0/ad/a15939ce4d40b69715e68b6c613e/election-2022-pennsylvania-75731.jpg"},"media:credit":[{"_":"Matt Rourke/AP Photo","$":{"scheme":"urn:ebu"}}],"media:title":[{"_":"Undated and incorrectly dated ballots have been at the center of a years-long legal fight in Pennsylvania.","$":{"type":"html"}}],"media:thumbnail":[{"$":{"url":"https://static.politico.com/d0/ad/a15939ce4d40b69715e68b6c613e/election-2022-pennsylvania-75731.jpg"}}]},"content":"It's the latest twist in a long-running dispute over ballot-counting in the swing state.","contentSnippet":"It's the latest twist in a long-running dispute over ballot-counting in the swing state.","guid":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/pennsylvania-court-undated-ballots-00064549","isoDate":"2022-11-02T01:36:07.000Z"},{"title":"Sheriff: ‘No truth’ in HBCU president’s comments on bus stop","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/sheriff-no-truth-hbcu-president-163804408.html","pubDate":"2022-10-31T16:38:04Z","media:content":{"$":{"height":"86","url":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/9109bf1c5bedf224b1ea92a87806e7da","width":"130"}},"guid":"sheriff-no-truth-hbcu-president-163804408.html","isoDate":"2022-10-31T16:38:04.000Z"},{"creator":"Grace Toohey","title":"Who is Paul Pelosi?

And I think that is absolutely critical. But the first step is taking Congress back,” Cruz said in a phone interview from a stop in Tennessee amid his nationwide tour for GOP candidates. “Everybody who can help us win in 2022 should be doing everything humanly possible to make it happen.”</p> <p>He added of the next two years: “It’s critical that we nominate and elect a strong conservative who can turn this country around. That’s what ’24 is going to be all about: Determining who that person is.

Tim Scott says any talk of it is premature. Ted Cruz allows that it’s in the back of his mind.\n Whether Republican senators demur or not, the 2024 presidential primaries are not far off. And for those who want to position themselves in case Donald Trump shows vulnerability or takes a pass, the last few days of the midterms amount to the race’s starting gun.\n As Trump finalizes his own midterm rally schedule, a half-dozen GOP senators have launched their own campaign expeditions that party insiders are sure to notice. That group includes Florida's Rick Scott, Iowa's Joni Ernst, as well as Scott of South Carolina, Cotton of Arkansas, Cruz of Texas and even Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \n No one wants to get ahead of the former president, of course. But there's a sense among Republicans that some senators may run even if Trump does — and many more will if the former president backs off. \n So as the calendar turns to November, GOP politicians are leaping onto their best stage: hotly contested congressional campaigns.\n \n \n “We’ve got to win the White House in ’24. And I think that is absolutely critical. But the first step is taking Congress back,” Cruz said in a phone interview from a stop in Tennessee amid his nationwide tour for GOP candidates. “Everybody who can help us win in 2022 should be doing everything humanly possible to make it happen.”\n He added of the next two years: “It’s critical that we nominate and elect a strong conservative who can turn this country around. That’s what ’24 is going to be all about: Determining who that person is. And before we get there, we’ve gotta get through 2022.”\n Senate Republicans already have competition in the midterms limelight beyond Trump's own rallies. Florida Gov.

That may be about to change by the end of the Court’s current term.</p> <p>Going back to <i>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke </i>in 1978, the court has said there is a compelling state interest in taking race into account in university admissions processes — seeing a need to remedy past <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> discrimination against certain groups. Some Supreme Court affirmative action cases have also recognized the educational benefits of having a racially- and ethnically-diverse student body.</p> <p>But the court has shifted with the appointment of three conservative justices under President Donald Trump. Many observers now believe the court will rule against Harvard and the University of North Carolina in a pair of affirmative action cases being argued today, reversing its over four-decade old ruling in the <i>Bakke</i> case.</p> <p>As a longtime college administrator, I know the practical implications would be huge for many of the more than 3,000 institutions of higher education in this country, especially those among the most elite. I’ve seen firsthand what happens in states where affirmative action has already been outlawed. The bottom line is a post-affirmative action world will close the door to many Black and Latino students at some of the nation’s top universities.

That may be about to change by the end of the Court’s current term.\n Going back to Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978, the court has said there is a compelling state interest in taking race into account in university admissions processes — seeing a need to remedy past de jure and de facto discrimination against certain groups. Some Supreme Court affirmative action cases have also recognized the educational benefits of having a racially- and ethnically-diverse student body.\n But the court has shifted with the appointment of three conservative justices under President Donald Trump. Many observers now believe the court will rule against Harvard and the University of North Carolina in a pair of affirmative action cases being argued today, reversing its over four-decade old ruling in the Bakke case.\n As a longtime college administrator, I know the practical implications would be huge for many of the more than 3,000 institutions of higher education in this country, especially those among the most elite. I’ve seen firsthand what happens in states where affirmative action has already been outlawed. The bottom line is a post-affirmative action world will close the door to many Black and Latino students at some of the nation’s top universities. And efforts to adapt to such new restrictions will not be easy.\n \n \n Affirmative action bans have already been implemented in nine states, though all apply only to public colleges and universities: California (1996), Washington (1998), Florida (1999), Michigan (2006), Nebraska (2008), Arizona (2010), New Hampshire (2012), Oklahoma (2012), and Idaho (2020). In these states, admissions offices at the public institutions are not allowed to take an applicant’s race or ethnicity into account when considering her for admission to the institution. This is true whether the institution is interested in remedying the effects of past discrimination against certain groups, or if it believes that having a more diverse student body benefits the education of all students. These same bans also apply to other programs that seek to promote educational equity by targeting particular racial or ethnic groups.\n With the implementation of these bans, most institutions — particularly the most selective public universities, such as the states’ flagship institutions — saw declines in the proportion of new undergraduate students from groups that have historically been underrepresented in higher education, including Black and Latino students.\n California was the first state to implement a ban on affirmative action in college and university admissions with the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996.

But it is.</p> <p>One clue is in plain sight as you look around during the boring few minutes it takes to top off your tank. Plopped in the corner of the lot like an afterthought are four vertical red slabs.</p> <p>They’re electric vehicle charging stations, capable of reviving an EV and its battery in about half an hour. It is no exaggeration to say they could be the most disruptive thing ever to confront that century-old fixture of the American roadside: the gas station. As more Americans<b> </b>drive their shiny new electric vehicles onto the highway and wonder where to go when the battery nears empty, charging stations are the agents of a revolutionary fill-up — not of gallons but kilowatts, not five-minute “stops” but half-hour “experiences” that could completely transform the tenor of the road trip.</p> <p>These pumps and plugs facing each other across the asphalt are also totems of an unseen battle. Two titans of the energy sector — electric companies and gas stations — have peacefully coexisted for a century but now find themselves vying for the right to serve electric vehicle owners. In just the last nine months, automakers have sold over 576,000 EVs, a 70-percent jump over the same period last year, according to auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. A burst of investment in both vehicles and chargers<b> </b>from automakers and the feds suggest that’s just the beginning. Ford and General Motors, America’s two biggest automakers, and the Biden administration have coalesced around a goal of electrifying half of new cars by 2030.</p> <p>Crucial to that future is a nationwide network of charging stations. Who controls those stations and the fuel coursing through them is the flash point of a fight between the electric utility and the convenience store. The outcome will impact where Americans charge their EVs and how much they pay.</p> <p>As both gas stations and power companies hang their future on the electric vehicle, the fight has gotten ugly. In fact, heads have already rolled. One electric utility, Southern California Edison, forced the resignation of a key lobbyist in order to kneecap the gas station industry as Congress considered President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging stations. The spigot of federal dollars only increased with the passage in August of the big federal climate-energy bill, stuffed with incentives to restructure the auto industry around EVs.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/4d/4d/0c1d8d314dc3b86f529368c6f61e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.biden.jpg\"> <br> <p>This collision between electricity and gasoline is in sharp relief at Kum &amp; Go, a chain of almost 400 filling stations and convenience marts in 11 states that has invited the electric vehicle to disrupt its business model. Wellington is the final settlement of metro Denver before the plains spread north toward Wyoming. Alongside the grind of I-25, next to a McDonald's, stands the Kum &amp; Go with its sign advertising the latest price for unleaded. It’s one of six Kum &amp; Go stations in the state that have embraced electric vehicle charging. Other gas station chains sometimes host charging stations owned by someone else, often Tesla. But Kum &amp; Go has branded these stations in its red-and-white color scheme.</p> <p>In 2018, Kum &amp; Go set the goal of “being known as the place that has EV charging,” said Jacob Maass, the company’s commercial fuel manager. This year, as electric vehicles have begun to seem inevitable and the Biden administration spends big to construct a network of 500,000 fast-charging stations, some of the country’s biggest fueling chains have joined the parade, including Pilot Co. and 7-Eleven.</p> <p>But success hinges on resolving fundamental disputes over who has the right to sell electricity, and for how much.</p> <p>The supply chain that underpins the gas station — starting in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia or Texas and flowing through intermediaries to that big price on the sign — becomes something else entirely in the EV age. What replaces it is a system of stupefying complexity. The price a station host pays for the new fuel is determined by which of America’s 3,000 electric utilities the plugs happen to be connected to. This pricing system is invisible to the driver but presents an existential dilemma for gas station owners. They find themselves at the mercy of an opaque, highly regulated and monopolistic electricity system that is the exact opposite of the one they have thrived on for decades. </p> <p>EV charging involves “an electricity market structure that was not designed for — and is, not surprisingly, incompatible with — the retail fuel market,” said A.J. Siccardi, a fueling executive, in testimony to Congress last summer that caused sparks between the two camps.</p> <p>It is possible that gas stations and electric companies will sort through their thicket of disagreements so that gas stations can make money filling batteries, while also (strangely enough) becoming a cool place to hang out. Or it’s possible that the fueling station as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by battery refills in home garages, at workplace parking lots or at Starbucks, while the driver nurses a venti latte.</p> <p>In other words, these electric cubes on the Colorado roadside are either the dominoes that trigger the gas station’s revolution, or the headstones that mark its grave.<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">A</span>merica’s 20th-century economic growth was powered by the electric grid and the gas station. But as businesses, they couldn’t be more different.</p> <p>The gas station arrived in the early 1900s, soon after the car itself, and quickly became a cutthroat game. Because the fuels they sold were nearly identical, sellers could differentiate themselves only by lowering prices. The only way to survive on those rock-bottom prices was to sell more gas. These imperatives drew fuelers to high-traffic intersections, where they broadcasted their prices from huge billboards. Today, America’s 120,000 gas stations are one of the most transparent, hyper-competitive markets in America.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/fa/59/7a977f2f40eaa4d75bc83bedc14e/ev-photogrid-v2.jpg\"> <br> <p>Unlike gasoline, electricity was not a street-corner hustle. People wanted it everywhere. Competing for business didn’t make sense because the wiring was so expensive. The grid wasn’t a business, really, but an essential public service — a utility. A social compact emerged where the electric utility would bear the cost of building and maintaining the grid, and in exchange would enjoy a territorial monopoly. To prevent abuse, each state created a public utility commission to oversee the utility’s complicated pricing schedules. The electric company became one of the most complex, obscure and uncompetitive markets in America. </p> <p>And then came the electric vehicle.</p> <p>It short-circuited what had been a symbiotic relationship. After all, gas stations and power companies are each other’s customers. The station illuminates its sign with electricity, and the utility fills its repair trucks with gasoline. Financially, the two are now nearly at parity: The convenience-store industry made $428 billion last year selling fuel, while corporate utilities earned $424 billion selling electricity. But the electric vehicle will inexorably tilt the playing field in the utility’s favor. That’s because with the onset of the EV, the dominant fuel will become electricity — and the utility controls it all.</p> <p>The utility monopoly is so basic to modern life that it goes unnoticed. But it explains why there’s never a usage fee for plugging in your laptop at the coffee shop, or for running the hotel hairdryer until your hairdo is crisp. Charging for electricity is illegal unless you’re the electric company.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/2b/39/c8548060429bbbda79a181b7fa9e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.electrichx.jpg\"> <br> <p>As electric vehicles started taking hold, it occurred to many entrepreneurs that fueling them could be a moneymaker. But they faced an odd financial barrier. The fueler pays the utility for the electricity, but can’t ask the driver to share the cost. So, companies found workarounds. Some providers charged for the time spent plugged in. Others assessed a session fee. (Until two years ago, Tesla Inc., the EV market leader, let many of its drivers refuel at its Supercharger stations for free.) No strategy reflected the actual cost, but they were a start. Business needed a change to the law — an exemption that would, for the first time, allow someone other than a power company to sell electricity.</p> <p>Delia Meier, a senior vice president at Iowa 80, a chain of truck stops, took a leading position in Iowa to open the market to ‘charge for charging,’ as it’s sometimes called. “There’s a lot of red tape, a lot of things that probably don’t make any sense,” she said. The Iowa Utilities Board rarely met and moved slow. Meier’s regional utility, Alliant Energy, would request additional hearings, and submit objections at the last minute. To Meier, it seemed the utility was conducting a passive, faceless resistance, using its unmatched savvy before the utility board to wear down any who would challenge its monopoly status.</p> <p>“The whole time it seemed like people were agreeing with us,” Meier said. “Then (the board) would have a hearing and decide not to do anything about it. It went on and on and on.”</p> <p>In a statement to POLITICO’s E&amp;E News, Alliant said, “We are excited to be on the leading edge of electrification efforts and work hard to understand and meet our customers’ needs.”<br></p> <br> <p>In 2019, after a three-year process, Iowa relaxed its rules so stations like Iowa 80 can charge its customers any price for electric fuel, just like gasoline. Most states have done the same. The main lobbyists who forced the issue weren’t gas stations, but new companies whose bread and butter were charging stations — EVgo Inc., ChargePoint Holdings Inc. and, of course, Tesla. Alongside them were environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that a transition to electric vehicles — necessary to head off the climate crisis — couldn’t happen without a financial incentive to sell electric fuel to drivers. Today, only seven states still regulate EV charging as the exclusive domain of the electric company.</p> <p>But even with the freedom to charge customers what they want, gas station owners still think that the utility has stacked the deck against them.</p> <p>One reason is that some utilities also own and operate charging stations. They do so with their ratepayers’ money, in plans approved by regulators. Generally, this happens sparingly and in areas shunned by private industry. But convenience store owners fear the utility as a competitor because the utility has a state-allotted profit built into each of its investments. They worry this padding could lead the utility to set a new floor for fuel prices that the gas station can’t match.</p> <p>Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, explained it this way to Georgia lawmakers last year. Her 6,500 members “have to use the electricity from only one utility. If that same electricity provider is allowed to provide electric fueling stations …<b> </b>taking zero capital risk like the private sector will, they will create and maintain a monopoly in this market.”</p> <p>Gas station owners say their resistance to the electric company is not an effort to slow the transition away from their marquee product. “We have no more commitment to fossil fuels than we do to Snickers bars,” said Brian Young, the owner of a chain of gas stations in eastern Alabama. Rather, it’s that the prospect of installing a charging station is intimidatingly expensive.</p> <p>Convenience stores make tiny profits on gasoline and diesel. “Whether we sell at one dollar or four dollars,” Young said, “we still make 14 cents.” In this low-margin world, a fast charger is a monster investment. The hardware can cost $150,000 or more, according to a 2019 study by think tank RMI. It is a bracing risk, especially since no one knows exactly where future EV drivers will want to fuel. </p> <p>“Honestly, I’m dreading it, but maybe there’s a silver lining,” said Bob Bajwa, the owner of a gas station in Ritzville, Wash., on the prospect of transitioning to EVs. He’s being somewhat optimistic given his personal experience. Bajwa already has one charging station — installed on his property in 2015 by charging provider EVgo — that gets only the occasional customer and produces almost no revenue.</p> <p>The convenience stores know they are overmatched. It’s hard to imagine a future without an electric grid, but one without gas stations can be pretty easily conjured. The fuelers can’t unseat the utility as the kingpin. But a crucial question remains: What will the fuel cost?<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">O</span>ut of sight, utilities and EV station hosts are locked in a furious pricing battle. It threatens to create an uneven charging network where stations are eagerly built in some areas and shunned in others.</p> <p>It comes down to an obscure set of maps. They demarcate the lines between utility service territories. Kum &amp; Go’s decision to put its charging station in Wellington was not an accident. It has a lot to do with the fact that Wellington sits in the territory of Xcel Energy Inc., the state’s largest utility. The consequences would be different if the station was built five blocks to the north, where the territory of a different utility, Poudre Valley REA, begins. The same is true six miles to the south, where power service transfers to yet another provider, the city of Fort Collins.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/a0/74213ce64fde93a5cb98eed8bdf9/mag.Ferris.EVStation.wellington.jpg\"> <br> <p>One reason Kum &amp; Go chose to put its station in Xcel’s territory, and not in Fort Collins or Poudre Valley, is the electricity bill. In particular, it comes down to one line item, a fee that homeowners know nothing about, but some businesses know only too well.</p> <p>It’s called a demand charge. It is a base fee that gets multiplied. The multiplier is the kilowatt, the basic measurement of electrons. The fee is assessed on the few minutes of the monthly billing cycle when the customer is using the most kilowatts. Power companies have always charged this kind of fee as a means to recover the substantial cost of providing service to the customers who need a lot of electrical infrastructure. But the rationale goes haywire when applied to electric vehicles.</p> <p>That’s because an electric vehicle fast charger sucks energy like a black hole.</p> <p>“The draw is incredible,” said Meier of the Iowa 80 truck stop. She installed a couple of fast chargers last year. This type, technically known as a direct-current fast charger, is the natural choice for fueling-on-the-go because it fills a battery in anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the charger and the car model, compared to the slower systems that EV owners put in the home garage that can take all night. If two electric cars arrive and plug in at the same time, the electricity flow becomes a flood. The two fast chargers at Meier’s truck stop can use as much juice in their peak moments<b> </b>as the center’s six restaurants, 56,000 square-foot store, gas pumps and back offices combined.</p> <p>This sudden slurp of electricity can vault a gas station from the power stature of, say, a warehouse into the tier of heavy-duty power users such as an aluminum factory or a large farm with lots of irrigation pumps. But there’s a crucial difference: The factory or farm can plan its electricity use to avoid the sting of high demand charges. The host of a charging station cannot. At some moment beyond the gas station’s control, a flock of EVs will descend simultaneously, and the bill goes stratospheric.</p> <p>Those demand charges become an enormous burden. Electrify America, a leading charging provider, says that demand charges are up to 80 percent of the cost of operating a charging station.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/89/79/137161aa4918a829b67e1892a12a/mag.Ferris.EVStation.installgrid.jpg\"> <br> <p>A look at these power companies’ rates reveals why Kum &amp; Go was motivated to put its EV chargers in Wellington. If four electric vehicles plug into Kum &amp; Go’s four chargers at the same moment, they require the utility to summon 250 kilowatts. In Wellington, in the realm of power company Xcel, that kilowattage yields a monthly demand charge of $750. If the station moved south to Fort Collins, the charge rises to $2,672. If Kum &amp; Go plugged in to the north, in Poudre Valley, it would rise to $4,750. That’s six times the cost in Wellington.</p> <p>Finding utility territories with lower demand charges has become “a checkpoint for us before we approve a site,” said Maass. As for the territories with higher demand charges, he said: “We’re trying to avoid it the best we can.”</p> <p>Heading north on I-25, a Denver driver glides across five utility territories without even noticing. But for the gas-station operator, they are a hazardous game of hopscotch. These random power fiefs are not just a Denver thing, either: Each of the country’s 3,000 electric utilities has its own demand-charge regime, none having a logical relationship to their neighbors.</p> <p>“Literally they can put it on the other side of the freeway and it will be much cheaper,” said John Phelan, an energy services manager of Fort Collins’ utility.</p> <p>Profit isn’t yet an option. With expensive equipment and few users, the convenience store’s best outcome is to break even. “We’re trying to cover the cost of the electricity bill,” said Meier of Iowa 80, “and I think that’s all that anyone can expect at this point.”</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go knows the pain of this math. Ken Kleemeier, its vice president of fuels, gives the example of a 150-kilowatt charging session with a $6 demand charge. Six dollars times 150 kilowatts means the electricity bill is $900. But “we charge the customer $10,” Kleemeier said.<b> </b>“That’s a $900 loss. That’s where the demand charges are painful. There’s no feasible way to pass that along.”</p> <p>The utilities believe the demand-charge burden is temporary. As electric vehicles become more common, a charging station’s “utilization rate” — the number of hours per day the station is in use — will increase. The demand charge will be absorbed by more and more users, and eventually turn the charging station from money pit into profit center.</p> <p>Furthermore, utilities are starting to offer “demand charge holidays.” These are a period of years where the utility voids or lowers the fee to ease the transition. Gas stations are skeptical. “When the holiday expires, you’re back to demand charges and you’re left with an investment you can’t make money off of,” said David Fialkov, head of government affairs at NATSO, a trade group for truck-stop operators.</p> <p>This multi-headed conflict has created lots of reasons for gas stations and utilities to confront each other. But no conflict has been as vicious as what happened in Washington, D.C., when billions of dollars were on the line.<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span>n the spring of 2021, as Congress was laying the foundations for President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, lobbyists for both utilities and convenience stores were working overtime, framing issues this way and not that, nudging lawmakers down policy paths that could become etched in law.</p> <p>Utilities wanted at least part of the billions of dollars that Congress was mulling for EV infrastructure to go toward their strong suit: installing new power lines and equipment to feed charging stations. They argued they were a crucial link to the EV future. The gas station lobby wanted money, too, to offset the expense of building charging stations. But even more than money, they wanted leverage. They saw an opportunity to have Congress put them, not utilities, at the center of EV fueling.</p> <p>And despite their relatively small size as a lobbying force, the gas stations were scoring some wins.</p> <p>“Our advocacy on all of those fronts, I think, began to get more attention,” said Doug Kantor. At the time, Kantor was a partner at the firm Steptoe, a leading law and lobbying firm with 300 lawyers in its Washington office. For years, Kantor had led a team at Steptoe that lobbied on behalf of several trade groups that represent gas stations and convenience stores.</p> <p>In May, an ally of Kantor’s secured a spot to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A.J. Siccardi, the president of Metroplex Energy, the parent company of RaceTrac, one of the country’s biggest fueling chains, laid out a detailed agenda that would, at every turn, benefit gas stations at the expense of utilities.</p> <p>Demand charges? Abolish them, Siccardi argued, and instead make electricity available at wholesale prices, like gasoline. Subsidies for charging stations? Bar utilities from getting them if they also tapped their ratepayers’ money. A “double dip,” he called it. He also called on Congress to force all states to make gas stations legal sellers of electricity.</p> <p>Despite its financial heft, no one from the utility industry was on the panel to refute him.</p> <p>But they quickly got wind of the proposals. Louis Finkel, the head of government relations at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said he was galled by the gas station lobby’s request to abolish demand charges, a pillar of how the utilities pay for expensive projects. “If someone said they have to rip out and move their fuel tanks a half a mile,” Finkel asked, “who would have to pay for it?”<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/7b/9e/367284eb43059d6268193741216e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.pizarro.jpg\"> <br> <p>In June, Kantor and the gas station lobby scored another win. A group of 17 legislators sent a letter to the committee heads responsible for the EV-charging portions of the bill.

One person was particularly put out: Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the state’s biggest utilities. Correa, the letter’s author, said he received a heated call from Pizarro. “I think he didn’t like the tone of the letter,” Correa said in an interview, adding that he said he apologized to Pizarro.</p> <p>In a statement to POLITICO’s E&amp;E News, Southern California Edison said, “the company reached out to numerous lawmakers on provisions of the infrastructure bill,” adding that Pizarro “spoke with Congressman Correa on the important role that electric utilities, with the support and approval of state regulatory commissions, must play in ensuring the deployment of EV charging infrastructure.”</p> <p>But Edison didn’t stop there.</p> <p>In May, Kantor said, some of his partners at Steptoe reached out with uncomfortable news. It involved a request from Edison and other utility clients of Steptoe who weren’t named. Kantor said he was told that Edison had informed Steptoe that if it didn’t sever its relationship with the fueling industry, the electric utility would take its business elsewhere. Kantor described the utility’s thinking as: “Hey, strategically it would be a good thing if we sidelined Steptoe, so they couldn’t continue this advocacy,” he said. “And that was exactly what they did.” Edison declined to comment on Kantor’s story, calling it “an internal matter that is best addressed by Steptoe &amp; Johnson,” the firm’s former name.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/9b/42/614bc9d64fd1b0ead723a74ee903/mag.Ferris.EVStation.traffic.jpg\"> <br> <p>No one forced Kantor to leave, but he thought it was the best thing. (“I did not think as an adviser to my clients that I should tell them they should continue to use me when one of the most important issues to the future of the industry was something that I couldn’t work on,” he said.)</p> <p>Those shoved out of Steptoe by the utilities now hold key positions in the gas-station industry. Kantor took a new job as general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a leading gas station trade group, while two people who left with him, Jessica Frend and LeeAnn Goheen, are in top policy jobs at NATSO. Steptoe declined to comment on the specifics of Kantor’s departure but said in a statement, “We continue to work with Doug in his role at NACS. We count him as a good personal friend as well as a former colleague.”</p> <p>In the end, despite its early tactical victories, the gas station lobby got little of what it wanted in the final infrastructure bill, which Biden signed in November. The bill did not overrule “charge for charging” regulations in individual states, nor block utilities from getting infrastructure funds. It asked state electricity regulators to consider the burden of demand charges, but that request has no teeth. By virtue of its incumbency and power, the utility industry had prevailed over the gas stations. It didn’t have to win; it just had to prevent change.</p> <p>“The c-stores and truck stops say sometimes that they’re uncomfortable” with the utilities’ regulated-monopoly model, said Phil Jones, a former utility regulator who heads a utility-heavy trade group, the Alliance for Transportation Electrification. “But we’ve told them that model is not going to change.”<br></p> <br> <p><br><span class=\"firstcharacter\">T</span>he gas station of the future might not have a single pump or even a whiff of gasoline. That’s because it might not be a gas station, but a Walgreens.</p> <p>In February, the drugstore chain said it would install fast chargers at more than 500 locations. The hardware comes from Volta Inc., a station provider whose stations double as advertising kiosks, and that also owns the financial transaction between car and charger. In June, Volta signed up the grocer Kroger Co. at locations in Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. Chris Wendel, the co-founder of Volta, thinks electric vehicles shatter the gas station’s very premise.</p> <p>“People won’t go to get fuel,” he said. “You will get it from your home or working place, or in the context of the other things you are doing.”</p> <p>Those other things could be buying groceries or picking up prescriptions — activities that neatly fit the 20 to 40 minutes it takes to fill a battery. Wendel intends for the retailer to capture any purchases now done at the convenience store “that has wallets attached,” he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kum &amp; Go is betting on a totally different scenario — one that it hopes will preserve the stature of the filling station in the roadside landscape.</p> <p>Driving, for example, on Denver’s I-25, you see your battery is low and check an app for nearby charging prices. Kum &amp; Go gets your business because its kilowatt-hour rate is two cents cheaper than the Loaf ’N Jug across the street.</p> <p>You pull in and plug into a hybrid charging plaza, alongside the gas pumps. The car says the refill will take 20 to 40 minutes. Hungry, you head toward the little mart that sits beside most every gas station in America. But that mart has transformed. It is no longer a sterile and slightly desperate place designed to satisfy your craving for candy or a lottery ticket, with a scary bathroom and the smell of old hot dogs. Instead, you find comfortable chairs. Tables. Wi-Fi. Under soft lighting, you explore the beer cave, or pick up a made-to-order sandwich on fresh-baked bread.</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go has brought the food and comfort part of that experience to more than 100 locations already in nine states between Colorado and Michigan. The plan is to have many overlap with electric vehicle charging, Maass said.</p> <p>So it is possible that someday you will nip out to the gas station for a burrito bowl. Or maybe you won’t because the fueling station itself will have wandered off to Taco Bell, which just announced a new chain of charging stations in California. Or to Starbucks, which, as it happens, is creating a chain of its own between Seattle and Denver.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/98/2d/522249a64d50bdf5ad7eac35887e/mag.Ferris.EVStation.walgreens.jpg\"> <br> <p>Beset as they are by new competitors, gas stations believe that drivers’ deep-seated habits give them an advantage, along with their perch at busy intersections. One type of station finds itself with particularly strong leverage: the highway stop in the middle of nowhere.</p> <p>Far from the Walgreens and Starbucks, an infusion of federal money is coming. The Biden administration knows drivers won’t buy EVs without the confidence that they can charge up on road trips. As a result, the very first EV spending from the bipartisan infrastructure bill — $1 billion — is dedicated to building charging stations every 50 miles on high-use corridors. These chargers must be no more than one mile from the highway — in other words, exactly where truck stops and highway gas stations are now.</p> <p>“The gravitational force of our position will require people to realize that without us, it won’t work,” said Fialkov of NATSO, the truck stop trade group.</p> <p>The millions of new electric vehicles that soon will arrive on America’s roads have gas stations hunting for new solutions.</p> <p>Kum &amp; Go, for example, next year will try deploying a battery next to a charging station. Its stored energy could be poured into cars at peak charging times and give the fueler a measure of independence from the utility, perhaps even allowing it to wring a small profit like it does with gas. Others foresee a slog of negotiations, utility by utility. Pilot, a truck-stop operator that wants to offer chargers at 500 locations, will ask power companies to standardize their rates in order to make the financials of charging more coherent. “We have some time to spend with the utilities, and a hill to climb,” said Shameek Konar, Pilot’s CEO.<br></p> <br> <img src=\"https://static.politico.com/5e/0e/8f6979f44f75913bac9848ce03a9/mag.Ferris.EVStation.ender.jpg\"> <br> <p>And gas stations haven’t given up on fighting utilities just because they lost out on the infrastructure bill. Early this year, the gas station lobby formed a new trade group called the Charge Ahead Partnership, made up mostly of gas-pump owners but aspiring to widen its utility pressure campaign to other charging-curious retailers, like grocers and shopping malls. “Public utilities currently have an unfair advantage over this new marketplace,” the group said in a statement last month.</p> <p>As they trade blows over who controls the electricity and how much it costs, both utilities and convenience stores are mindful that tomorrow’s charging network will be shaped by the preferences of people like Jennifer Sirani.</p> <p>In June, Sirani ran into trouble in Wyoming. She was braving a trip from Idaho to Nebraska for her sister’s wedding in her new electric Kia Niro. Between Rock Springs and Laramie, a 200-mile charging desert, Sirani realized her battery was dying. Salvation took the form of truck stop. There she got a tow truck that pulled her 20 miles to a charging station down the line.</p> <p>The following day, as she refilled yet again at Kum &amp; Go’s charging station in Wellington, she cast an eye at the gas pumps and the little convenience mart. One day that shop could satisfy her long wait with a healthy protein bowl, but today it’s just potato chips and Gatorade.</p> <p>“Here is OK,” she concluded. “At the Walmart, there’s a little more to do.”<br></p> <br> <br> <br>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"WELLINGTON, Colo. — In the farthest Denver suburbs, just off Interstate 25 stands a gas station called Kum & Go that doesn’t look like a battle zone. But it is.\n One clue is in plain sight as you look around during the boring few minutes it takes to top off your tank. Plopped in the corner of the lot like an afterthought are four vertical red slabs.\n They’re electric vehicle charging stations, capable of reviving an EV and its battery in about half an hour. It is no exaggeration to say they could be the most disruptive thing ever to confront that century-old fixture of the American roadside: the gas station. As more Americans drive their shiny new electric vehicles onto the highway and wonder where to go when the battery nears empty, charging stations are the agents of a revolutionary fill-up — not of gallons but kilowatts, not five-minute “stops” but half-hour “experiences” that could completely transform the tenor of the road trip.\n These pumps and plugs facing each other across the asphalt are also totems of an unseen battle. Two titans of the energy sector — electric companies and gas stations — have peacefully coexisted for a century but now find themselves vying for the right to serve electric vehicle owners. In just the last nine months, automakers have sold over 576,000 EVs, a 70-percent jump over the same period last year, according to auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. A burst of investment in both vehicles and chargers from automakers and the feds suggest that’s just the beginning. Ford and General Motors, America’s two biggest automakers, and the Biden administration have coalesced around a goal of electrifying half of new cars by 2030.\n Crucial to that future is a nationwide network of charging stations. Who controls those stations and the fuel coursing through them is the flash point of a fight between the electric utility and the convenience store. The outcome will impact where Americans charge their EVs and how much they pay.\n As both gas stations and power companies hang their future on the electric vehicle, the fight has gotten ugly. In fact, heads have already rolled. One electric utility, Southern California Edison, forced the resignation of a key lobbyist in order to kneecap the gas station industry as Congress considered President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included $7.5 billion for electric-vehicle charging stations. The spigot of federal dollars only increased with the passage in August of the big federal climate-energy bill, stuffed with incentives to restructure the auto industry around EVs.\n \n  \n This collision between electricity and gasoline is in sharp relief at Kum & Go, a chain of almost 400 filling stations and convenience marts in 11 states that has invited the electric vehicle to disrupt its business model. Wellington is the final settlement of metro Denver before the plains spread north toward Wyoming. Alongside the grind of I-25, next to a McDonald's, stands the Kum & Go with its sign advertising the latest price for unleaded. It’s one of six Kum & Go stations in the state that have embraced electric vehicle charging. Other gas station chains sometimes host charging stations owned by someone else, often Tesla. But Kum & Go has branded these stations in its red-and-white color scheme.\n In 2018, Kum & Go set the goal of “being known as the place that has EV charging,” said Jacob Maass, the company’s commercial fuel manager. This year, as electric vehicles have begun to seem inevitable and the Biden administration spends big to construct a network of 500,000 fast-charging stations, some of the country’s biggest fueling chains have joined the parade, including Pilot Co. and 7-Eleven.\n But success hinges on resolving fundamental disputes over who has the right to sell electricity, and for how much.\n The supply chain that underpins the gas station — starting in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia or Texas and flowing through intermediaries to that big price on the sign — becomes something else entirely in the EV age. What replaces it is a system of stupefying complexity. The price a station host pays for the new fuel is determined by which of America’s 3,000 electric utilities the plugs happen to be connected to. This pricing system is invisible to the driver but presents an existential dilemma for gas station owners. They find themselves at the mercy of an opaque, highly regulated and monopolistic electricity system that is the exact opposite of the one they have thrived on for decades. \n EV charging involves “an electricity market structure that was not designed for — and is, not surprisingly, incompatible with — the retail fuel market,” said A.J. Siccardi, a fueling executive, in testimony to Congress last summer that caused sparks between the two camps.\n It is possible that gas stations and electric companies will sort through their thicket of disagreements so that gas stations can make money filling batteries, while also (strangely enough) becoming a cool place to hang out. Or it’s possible that the fueling station as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by battery refills in home garages, at workplace parking lots or at Starbucks, while the driver nurses a venti latte.\n In other words, these electric cubes on the Colorado roadside are either the dominoes that trigger the gas station’s revolution, or the headstones that mark its grave.\n \n \nAmerica’s 20th-century economic growth was powered by the electric grid and the gas station. But as businesses, they couldn’t be more different.\n The gas station arrived in the early 1900s, soon after the car itself, and quickly became a cutthroat game. Because the fuels they sold were nearly identical, sellers could differentiate themselves only by lowering prices. The only way to survive on those rock-bottom prices was to sell more gas. These imperatives drew fuelers to high-traffic intersections, where they broadcasted their prices from huge billboards. Today, America’s 120,000 gas stations are one of the most transparent, hyper-competitive markets in America.\n \n  \n Unlike gasoline, electricity was not a street-corner hustle. People wanted it everywhere. Competing for business didn’t make sense because the wiring was so expensive. The grid wasn’t a business, really, but an essential public service — a utility. A social compact emerged where the electric utility would bear the cost of building and maintaining the grid, and in exchange would enjoy a territorial monopoly. To prevent abuse, each state created a public utility commission to oversee the utility’s complicated pricing schedules. The electric company became one of the most complex, obscure and uncompetitive markets in America. \n And then came the electric vehicle.\n It short-circuited what had been a symbiotic relationship. After all, gas stations and power companies are each other’s customers. The station illuminates its sign with electricity, and the utility fills its repair trucks with gasoline. Financially, the two are now nearly at parity: The convenience-store industry made $428 billion last year selling fuel, while corporate utilities earned $424 billion selling electricity. But the electric vehicle will inexorably tilt the playing field in the utility’s favor. That’s because with the onset of the EV, the dominant fuel will become electricity — and the utility controls it all.\n The utility monopoly is so basic to modern life that it goes unnoticed. But it explains why there’s never a usage fee for plugging in your laptop at the coffee shop, or for running the hotel hairdryer until your hairdo is crisp. Charging for electricity is illegal unless you’re the electric company.\n \n  \n As electric vehicles started taking hold, it occurred to many entrepreneurs that fueling them could be a moneymaker. But they faced an odd financial barrier. The fueler pays the utility for the electricity, but can’t ask the driver to share the cost. So, companies found workarounds. Some providers charged for the time spent plugged in. Others assessed a session fee. (Until two years ago, Tesla Inc., the EV market leader, let many of its drivers refuel at its Supercharger stations for free.) No strategy reflected the actual cost, but they were a start. Business needed a change to the law — an exemption that would, for the first time, allow someone other than a power company to sell electricity.\n Delia Meier, a senior vice president at Iowa 80, a chain of truck stops, took a leading position in Iowa to open the market to ‘charge for charging,’ as it’s sometimes called. “There’s a lot of red tape, a lot of things that probably don’t make any sense,” she said. The Iowa Utilities Board rarely met and moved slow. Meier’s regional utility, Alliant Energy, would request additional hearings, and submit objections at the last minute. To Meier, it seemed the utility was conducting a passive, faceless resistance, using its unmatched savvy before the utility board to wear down any who would challenge its monopoly status.\n “The whole time it seemed like people were agreeing with us,” Meier said. “Then (the board) would have a hearing and decide not to do anything about it. It went on and on and on.”\n In a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News, Alliant said, “We are excited to be on the leading edge of electrification efforts and work hard to understand and meet our customers’ needs.”\n \n In 2019, after a three-year process, Iowa relaxed its rules so stations like Iowa 80 can charge its customers any price for electric fuel, just like gasoline. Most states have done the same. The main lobbyists who forced the issue weren’t gas stations, but new companies whose bread and butter were charging stations — EVgo Inc., ChargePoint Holdings Inc. and, of course, Tesla. Alongside them were environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that a transition to electric vehicles — necessary to head off the climate crisis — couldn’t happen without a financial incentive to sell electric fuel to drivers. Today, only seven states still regulate EV charging as the exclusive domain of the electric company.\n But even with the freedom to charge customers what they want, gas station owners still think that the utility has stacked the deck against them.\n One reason is that some utilities also own and operate charging stations. They do so with their ratepayers’ money, in plans approved by regulators. Generally, this happens sparingly and in areas shunned by private industry. But convenience store owners fear the utility as a competitor because the utility has a state-allotted profit built into each of its investments. They worry this padding could lead the utility to set a new floor for fuel prices that the gas station can’t match.\n Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, explained it this way to Georgia lawmakers last year. Her 6,500 members “have to use the electricity from only one utility. If that same electricity provider is allowed to provide electric fueling stations … taking zero capital risk like the private sector will, they will create and maintain a monopoly in this market.”\n Gas station owners say their resistance to the electric company is not an effort to slow the transition away from their marquee product. “We have no more commitment to fossil fuels than we do to Snickers bars,” said Brian Young, the owner of a chain of gas stations in eastern Alabama. Rather, it’s that the prospect of installing a charging station is intimidatingly expensive.\n Convenience stores make tiny profits on gasoline and diesel. “Whether we sell at one dollar or four dollars,” Young said, “we still make 14 cents.” In this low-margin world, a fast charger is a monster investment. The hardware can cost $150,000 or more, according to a 2019 study by think tank RMI. It is a bracing risk, especially since no one knows exactly where future EV drivers will want to fuel. \n “Honestly, I’m dreading it, but maybe there’s a silver lining,” said Bob Bajwa, the owner of a gas station in Ritzville, Wash., on the prospect of transitioning to EVs. He’s being somewhat optimistic given his personal experience. Bajwa already has one charging station — installed on his property in 2015 by charging provider EVgo — that gets only the occasional customer and produces almost no revenue.\n The convenience stores know they are overmatched. It’s hard to imagine a future without an electric grid, but one without gas stations can be pretty easily conjured. The fuelers can’t unseat the utility as the kingpin. But a crucial question remains: What will the fuel cost?\n \n \nOut of sight, utilities and EV station hosts are locked in a furious pricing battle. It threatens to create an uneven charging network where stations are eagerly built in some areas and shunned in others.\n It comes down to an obscure set of maps. They demarcate the lines between utility service territories. Kum & Go’s decision to put its charging station in Wellington was not an accident. It has a lot to do with the fact that Wellington sits in the territory of Xcel Energy Inc., the state’s largest utility. The consequences would be different if the station was built five blocks to the north, where the territory of a different utility, Poudre Valley REA, begins. The same is true six miles to the south, where power service transfers to yet another provider, the city of Fort Collins.\n \n  \n One reason Kum & Go chose to put its station in Xcel’s territory, and not in Fort Collins or Poudre Valley, is the electricity bill. In particular, it comes down to one line item, a fee that homeowners know nothing about, but some businesses know only too well.\n It’s called a demand charge. It is a base fee that gets multiplied. The multiplier is the kilowatt, the basic measurement of electrons. The fee is assessed on the few minutes of the monthly billing cycle when the customer is using the most kilowatts. Power companies have always charged this kind of fee as a means to recover the substantial cost of providing service to the customers who need a lot of electrical infrastructure. But the rationale goes haywire when applied to electric vehicles.\n That’s because an electric vehicle fast charger sucks energy like a black hole.\n “The draw is incredible,” said Meier of the Iowa 80 truck stop. She installed a couple of fast chargers last year. This type, technically known as a direct-current fast charger, is the natural choice for fueling-on-the-go because it fills a battery in anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the charger and the car model, compared to the slower systems that EV owners put in the home garage that can take all night. If two electric cars arrive and plug in at the same time, the electricity flow becomes a flood. The two fast chargers at Meier’s truck stop can use as much juice in their peak moments as the center’s six restaurants, 56,000 square-foot store, gas pumps and back offices combined.\n This sudden slurp of electricity can vault a gas station from the power stature of, say, a warehouse into the tier of heavy-duty power users such as an aluminum factory or a large farm with lots of irrigation pumps. But there’s a crucial difference: The factory or farm can plan its electricity use to avoid the sting of high demand charges. The host of a charging station cannot. At some moment beyond the gas station’s control, a flock of EVs will descend simultaneously, and the bill goes stratospheric.\n Those demand charges become an enormous burden. Electrify America, a leading charging provider, says that demand charges are up to 80 percent of the cost of operating a charging station.\n \n  \n A look at these power companies’ rates reveals why Kum & Go was motivated to put its EV chargers in Wellington. If four electric vehicles plug into Kum & Go’s four chargers at the same moment, they require the utility to summon 250 kilowatts. In Wellington, in the realm of power company Xcel, that kilowattage yields a monthly demand charge of $750. If the station moved south to Fort Collins, the charge rises to $2,672. If Kum & Go plugged in to the north, in Poudre Valley, it would rise to $4,750. That’s six times the cost in Wellington.\n Finding utility territories with lower demand charges has become “a checkpoint for us before we approve a site,” said Maass. As for the territories with higher demand charges, he said: “We’re trying to avoid it the best we can.”\n Heading north on I-25, a Denver driver glides across five utility territories without even noticing. But for the gas-station operator, they are a hazardous game of hopscotch. These random power fiefs are not just a Denver thing, either: Each of the country’s 3,000 electric utilities has its own demand-charge regime, none having a logical relationship to their neighbors.\n “Literally they can put it on the other side of the freeway and it will be much cheaper,” said John Phelan, an energy services manager of Fort Collins’ utility.\n Profit isn’t yet an option. With expensive equipment and few users, the convenience store’s best outcome is to break even. “We’re trying to cover the cost of the electricity bill,” said Meier of Iowa 80, “and I think that’s all that anyone can expect at this point.”\n Kum & Go knows the pain of this math. Ken Kleemeier, its vice president of fuels, gives the example of a 150-kilowatt charging session with a $6 demand charge. Six dollars times 150 kilowatts means the electricity bill is $900. But “we charge the customer $10,” Kleemeier said. “That’s a $900 loss. That’s where the demand charges are painful. There’s no feasible way to pass that along.”\n The utilities believe the demand-charge burden is temporary. As electric vehicles become more common, a charging station’s “utilization rate” — the number of hours per day the station is in use — will increase. The demand charge will be absorbed by more and more users, and eventually turn the charging station from money pit into profit center.\n Furthermore, utilities are starting to offer “demand charge holidays.” These are a period of years where the utility voids or lowers the fee to ease the transition. Gas stations are skeptical. “When the holiday expires, you’re back to demand charges and you’re left with an investment you can’t make money off of,” said David Fialkov, head of government affairs at NATSO, a trade group for truck-stop operators.\n This multi-headed conflict has created lots of reasons for gas stations and utilities to confront each other. But no conflict has been as vicious as what happened in Washington, D.C., when billions of dollars were on the line.\n \n \nIn the spring of 2021, as Congress was laying the foundations for President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, lobbyists for both utilities and convenience stores were working overtime, framing issues this way and not that, nudging lawmakers down policy paths that could become etched in law.\n Utilities wanted at least part of the billions of dollars that Congress was mulling for EV infrastructure to go toward their strong suit: installing new power lines and equipment to feed charging stations. They argued they were a crucial link to the EV future. The gas station lobby wanted money, too, to offset the expense of building charging stations. But even more than money, they wanted leverage. They saw an opportunity to have Congress put them, not utilities, at the center of EV fueling.\n And despite their relatively small size as a lobbying force, the gas stations were scoring some wins.\n “Our advocacy on all of those fronts, I think, began to get more attention,” said Doug Kantor. At the time, Kantor was a partner at the firm Steptoe, a leading law and lobbying firm with 300 lawyers in its Washington office. For years, Kantor had led a team at Steptoe that lobbied on behalf of several trade groups that represent gas stations and convenience stores.\n In May, an ally of Kantor’s secured a spot to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A.J. Siccardi, the president of Metroplex Energy, the parent company of RaceTrac, one of the country’s biggest fueling chains, laid out a detailed agenda that would, at every turn, benefit gas stations at the expense of utilities.\n Demand charges? Abolish them, Siccardi argued, and instead make electricity available at wholesale prices, like gasoline. Subsidies for charging stations? Bar utilities from getting them if they also tapped their ratepayers’ money. A “double dip,” he called it. He also called on Congress to force all states to make gas stations legal sellers of electricity.\n Despite its financial heft, no one from the utility industry was on the panel to refute him.\n But they quickly got wind of the proposals. Louis Finkel, the head of government relations at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said he was galled by the gas station lobby’s request to abolish demand charges, a pillar of how the utilities pay for expensive projects. “If someone said they have to rip out and move their fuel tanks a half a mile,” Finkel asked, “who would have to pay for it?”\n \n  \n In June, Kantor and the gas station lobby scored another win. A group of 17 legislators sent a letter to the committee heads responsible for the EV-charging portions of the bill. Led by Rep. Lou Correa, a Democrat from California’s Orange County, it echoed gas stations’ talking points. “Fuel retailers are best positioned to own and operate EV charging stations and provide transportation energy to consumers,” the letter said.\n The way the letter put gas stations at the center of electric fueling, while limiting the electric company’s role, made some in the utility industry furious. One person was particularly put out: Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, one of the state’s biggest utilities. Correa, the letter’s author, said he received a heated call from Pizarro. “I think he didn’t like the tone of the letter,” Correa said in an interview, adding that he said he apologized to Pizarro.\n In a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News, Southern California Edison said, “the company reached out to numerous lawmakers on provisions of the infrastructure bill,” adding that Pizarro “spoke with Congressman Correa on the important role that electric utilities, with the support and approval of state regulatory commissions, must play in ensuring the deployment of EV charging infrastructure.”\n But Edison didn’t stop there.\n In May, Kantor said, some of his partners at Steptoe reached out with uncomfortable news. It involved a request from Edison and other utility clients of Steptoe who weren’t named. Kantor said he was told that Edison had informed Steptoe that if it didn’t sever its relationship with the fueling industry, the electric utility would take its business elsewhere. Kantor described the utility’s thinking as: “Hey, strategically it would be a good thing if we sidelined Steptoe, so they couldn’t continue this advocacy,” he said. “And that was exactly what they did.” Edison declined to comment on Kantor’s story, calling it “an internal matter that is best addressed by Steptoe & Johnson,” the firm’s former name.\n \n  \n No one forced Kantor to leave, but he thought it was the best thing. (“I did not think as an adviser to my clients that I should tell them they should continue to use me when one of the most important issues to the future of the industry was something that I couldn’t work on,” he said.)\n Those shoved out of Steptoe by the utilities now hold key positions in the gas-station industry. Kantor took a new job as general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a leading gas station trade group, while two people who left with him, Jessica Frend and LeeAnn Goheen, are in top policy jobs at NATSO. Steptoe declined to comment on the specifics of Kantor’s departure but said in a statement, “We continue to work with Doug in his role at NACS. We count him as a good personal friend as well as a former colleague.”\n In the end, despite its early tactical victories, the gas station lobby got little of what it wanted in the final infrastructure bill, which Biden signed in November. The bill did not overrule “charge for charging” regulations in individual states, nor block utilities from getting infrastructure funds. It asked state electricity regulators to consider the burden of demand charges, but that request has no teeth. By virtue of its incumbency and power, the utility industry had prevailed over the gas stations. It didn’t have to win; it just had to prevent change.\n “The c-stores and truck stops say sometimes that they’re uncomfortable” with the utilities’ regulated-monopoly model, said Phil Jones, a former utility regulator who heads a utility-heavy trade group, the Alliance for Transportation Electrification. “But we’ve told them that model is not going to change.”\n \n \nThe gas station of the future might not have a single pump or even a whiff of gasoline. That’s because it might not be a gas station, but a Walgreens.\n In February, the drugstore chain said it would install fast chargers at more than 500 locations. The hardware comes from Volta Inc., a station provider whose stations double as advertising kiosks, and that also owns the financial transaction between car and charger. In June, Volta signed up the grocer Kroger Co. at locations in Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. Chris Wendel, the co-founder of Volta, thinks electric vehicles shatter the gas station’s very premise.\n “People won’t go to get fuel,” he said. “You will get it from your home or working place, or in the context of the other things you are doing.”\n Those other things could be buying groceries or picking up prescriptions — activities that neatly fit the 20 to 40 minutes it takes to fill a battery. Wendel intends for the retailer to capture any purchases now done at the convenience store “that has wallets attached,” he said.\n Meanwhile, Kum & Go is betting on a totally different scenario — one that it hopes will preserve the stature of the filling station in the roadside landscape.\n Driving, for example, on Denver’s I-25, you see your battery is low and check an app for nearby charging prices. Kum & Go gets your business because its kilowatt-hour rate is two cents cheaper than the Loaf ’N Jug across the street.\n You pull in and plug into a hybrid charging plaza, alongside the gas pumps. The car says the refill will take 20 to 40 minutes. Hungry, you head toward the little mart that sits beside most every gas station in America. But that mart has transformed. It is no longer a sterile and slightly desperate place designed to satisfy your craving for candy or a lottery ticket, with a scary bathroom and the smell of old hot dogs. Instead, you find comfortable chairs. Tables. Wi-Fi. Under soft lighting, you explore the beer cave, or pick up a made-to-order sandwich on fresh-baked bread.\n Kum & Go has brought the food and comfort part of that experience to more than 100 locations already in nine states between Colorado and Michigan. The plan is to have many overlap with electric vehicle charging, Maass said.\n So it is possible that someday you will nip out to the gas station for a burrito bowl. Or maybe you won’t because the fueling station itself will have wandered off to Taco Bell, which just announced a new chain of charging stations in California. Or to Starbucks, which, as it happens, is creating a chain of its own between Seattle and Denver.\n \n  \n Beset as they are by new competitors, gas stations believe that drivers’ deep-seated habits give them an advantage, along with their perch at busy intersections. One type of station finds itself with particularly strong leverage: the highway stop in the middle of nowhere.\n Far from the Walgreens and Starbucks, an infusion of federal money is coming. The Biden administration knows drivers won’t buy EVs without the confidence that they can charge up on road trips. As a result, the very first EV spending from the bipartisan infrastructure bill — $1 billion — is dedicated to building charging stations every 50 miles on high-use corridors. These chargers must be no more than one mile from the highway — in other words, exactly where truck stops and highway gas stations are now.\n “The gravitational force of our position will require people to realize that without us, it won’t work,” said Fialkov of NATSO, the truck stop trade group.\n The millions of new electric vehicles that soon will arrive on America’s roads have gas stations hunting for new solutions.\n Kum & Go, for example, next year will try deploying a battery next to a charging station. Its stored energy could be poured into cars at peak charging times and give the fueler a measure of independence from the utility, perhaps even allowing it to wring a small profit like it does with gas. Others foresee a slog of negotiations, utility by utility. Pilot, a truck-stop operator that wants to offer chargers at 500 locations, will ask power companies to standardize their rates in order to make the financials of charging more coherent. “We have some time to spend with the utilities, and a hill to climb,” said Shameek Konar, Pilot’s CEO.\n \n  \n And gas stations haven’t given up on fighting utilities just because they lost out on the infrastructure bill. Early this year, the gas station lobby formed a new trade group called the Charge Ahead Partnership, made up mostly of gas-pump owners but aspiring to widen its utility pressure campaign to other charging-curious retailers, like grocers and shopping malls. “Public utilities currently have an unfair advantage over this new marketplace,” the group said in a statement last month.\n As they trade blows over who controls the electricity and how much it costs, both utilities and convenience stores are mindful that tomorrow’s charging network will be shaped by the preferences of people like Jennifer Sirani.\n In June, Sirani ran into trouble in Wyoming. She was braving a trip from Idaho to Nebraska for her sister’s wedding in her new electric Kia Niro. Between Rock Springs and Laramie, a 200-mile charging desert, Sirani realized her battery was dying. Salvation took the form of truck stop. There she got a tow truck that pulled her 20 miles to a charging station down the line.\n The following day, as she refilled yet again at Kum & Go’s charging station in Wellington, she cast an eye at the gas pumps and the little convenience mart.
