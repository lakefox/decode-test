VP Singh and his taller associate BP Singh –<g> no </g>relation – are discussing Shamsi Jama Masjid, the<g><g> mosque </g></g>that has stood in this small town in Uttar Pradesh for 800 years.According to the lawyers, this grand white-domed mosque, one of the largest and oldest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>, is not a<g><g> mosque </g></g>at all. “No no, this is a Hindu temple,” asserted BP Singh. “It’s a very holy place for Hindus.”","Records dating<g> back </g>to 1856 make reference to the working mosque, and according to local Muslims, they have been praying there undisturbed since it was built by Shamsuddin<strong> </strong>Iltutmish, a Muslim king, in 1223. The Singhs however, have a different version of events. In July, they filed a court case on behalf of a local Hindu farmer – and backed by the rightwing Hindu nationalist party Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) – alleging that Shamsi Jama Masjid is not a<g><g> mosque </g></g>but an “illegal structure” built on a destroyed 10th-century Hindu temple for the god Shiva. Their petition states that Hindus have rightful ownership of the land and should be able to pray there.Except, the two bickering lawyers can’t quite agree on the historical facts. BP Singh initially<g> claimed </g>that the original Hindu temple was destroyed by a Muslim tyrant king – but then VP Singh contradicts him.<span></span>","“Not destroyed, <em>altered,” </em>said VP Singh<em>. </em>“Most of the original Hindu temple is still there.” They claim as evidence a lotus flower painted on the inside of the<g><g> mosque </g></g>dome. But<g> when </g>the <em>Observer</em> was given access to the mosque, there was<g> no </g>such Hindu motif, and instead it was the calligraphy of a Qur’anic verse. There was also<g> no </g>sign of an alleged “hidden locked room filled with Hindu idols” in the mosque, which VP Singh<g> claimed </g>he had seen in the 1970s as a child. Instead, the room in question was a store cupboard, filled with cleaning materials and<g> prayer </g>mats.<span></span>","The pair also could not settle on exactly<g> when </g>Shamsi Jama Masjid, which they refuse to call a mosque, began to be<g> used </g>by Muslims for<g> prayer </g>five times a day as it is today. After BP Singh stated that Muslims were praying there up till the 1800s, VP Singh leaned over to mutter quietly to his associate: “No<g> no </g>don’t say that, don’t say that.”","More loudly, VP Singh then proclaimed: “Actually<g> no </g>this wasn’t a mosque, it was never<g> used </g>for <em>namaz</em> [Muslim prayer]<g> until </g>recently<g> when </g>the Muslims<g> forcibly </g>occupied it and<g> tried </g>to<g> convert </g>it into a mosque.” They<g> claimed </g>to have “proof” but were<g> unable </g>to<g> find </g>it.“When the Muslims ruled, we Hindus were all persecuted, we were<g> killed </g>and tortured,”<g> added </g>BP Singh. “Now we are<g> taking </g>back what is<g> rightfully </g>ours.”","The case has been met by puzzlement from local Muslims, who are contesting it in court. “How can you claim this is not a mosque?,” said Anwer Alam, legal counsel for the<g><g> mosque </g></g>committee, pointing up to the imposing white domes. “No Hindu has ever prayed at this<g><g> mosque </g></g>since its inception 800 years ago. This suit has<g> no </g>legal grounds.”But those behind the case say Budaun is just the beginning. “We have a list of about 3,000 that we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/india-mosque-demolition-officials-accused-of-filing-false-report-on-muslim-leaders\">decided to reclaim legally</a>,” said Sanjay Hariyana, a state spokesperson for ABHM.<span></span>","Since 2014,<g> when </g>the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government came to power, India’s 200 million minority Muslims say they have been subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">persecution, violence and state-sponsored discrimination</a>. Under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/20/what-is-hindu-nationalism-and-who-are-the-rss\">Hindutva</a> (Hindu nationalist) agenda – which aims to establish India as a Hindu nation, rather than a secular state – Muslim civilians, activists and journalists have been routinely targeted, Muslim businesses boycotted and Islamophobic rhetoric<g> used </g>by BJP leaders, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">lynching of Muslims</a> has been on the rise. <span></span>","Mosques have begun to be caught up in a wide-ranging project under the BJP to<g> rewrite </g>India’s<g> history </g>according to Hindutva ideology. The version of<g> history </g>now propagated by BJP leaders, government-backed historians and school curriculums is that of an ancient Hindu nation oppressed and<g> persecuted </g>for hundreds of years by ruthless Muslim invaders, particularly the Islamic Mughal empire that<g> ruled </g>from the 16th to the 19th century.The alleged destruction of Hindu temples to build<g> mosques </g>has been central to this narrative. In May, a senior BJP leader<g> claimed </g>that Mughals had destroyed 36,000 Hindu temples and they would “reclaim all those temples one by one”.","But Richard Eaton, a professor of Indian<g> history </g>at the University of Arizona, said there was<g> no </g>historical evidence for this, with Mughals thought to have torn down only about two dozen temples. “Claims of many<g> thousands </g>of such instances are outlandish, irresponsible and without foundation,” he said.","Historians have accused the BJP of not only rewriting, but “inventing” India’s<g> history </g>in their own image. Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi<em><strong>, </strong></em>a professor of Mughal<g> history </g>at Aligarh Muslim University, described the BJP’s polarised version of Indian<g> history </g>as “fantasy, nothing more than fiction” invented to serve their political agenda. “The<g> history </g>of India is being painted as a black and white narrative of Hindus versus Muslims,” said Rezavi. “But it was never so.”<span></span>Yet Indian historians whose work contradicts this version of history, or who have spoken out, have found themselves sidelined, penalised or ousted from government bodies and academic institutions which rely on government funding. <span></span>","Rezavi is one of the few historians in India who still dare to speak; many approached by the <em>Observer</em> declined, citing fears over their jobs or their safety. Foreign historians have also been targeted. Audrey Truschke, a<g> history </g>professor at Rutgers University in the US, has faced death threats, allegedly from Hindu rightwing groups, for her work on Mughals.","Rezavi likened the attacks and silencing of historians and scholars to the targeting of academics in Nazi Germany. “A large number of historians are afraid to speak up openly,” he said. “I have been a victim of discrimination and persecution because of speaking up. But show me one Indian historian worth his salt who is with the government? There is not one.”<span></span>","As the impetus to avenge and reclaim India’s<g> history </g>for Hindus has gained traction, dozens of petitions have been filed by right-wing Hindu groups against<g> mosques </g>across the country. India has a law which explicitly protects places of worship from being disputed post-1947 but judges are allowing cases. Even India’s most famous monument, the Taj Mahal, which was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, has not escaped litigation, and a case – widely derided by historians – was filed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/30/taj-mahal-muslim-tomb-not-hindu-temple-indian-court-told\">alleging it was originally a Hindu temple</a> with locked rooms of Hindu relics. Alok Vats, a senior BJP leader, said the party had “no role” in the lawsuits but that these groups were “seeking to do exactly what the Hindu community wants”.","The cases have been further galvanised by a 2019 supreme court ruling which handed over Babri Masjid, a 16th-century<g><g> mosque </g></g>in the Uttar Pradesh town of Ayodhya, to Hindus after they<g> claimed </g>it was the birthplace of their god, Lord Ram. In 1992, the<g><g> mosque </g></g>was torn down by a rightwing Hindu mob, an incident many fear could now be repeated with the escalating number of disputed mosques. This month, a<g><g> mosque </g></g>in the city of Gurgaon was violently attacked by a mob of about 200, while in the state of Karnataka a Hindu crowd barged into a madrassa, placed a Hindu idol inside and performed a prayer.<span></span>In Mathura, a city in Uttar Pradesh, Shahi Eidgah mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1670, is now facing 12 lawsuits claiming it is built on the birthplace of the Hindu god Lord Krishna and ruins of a Hindu temple<span></span>","Muslims are fighting the case but in a city that has long prided itself on communal harmony, Hindus are also among those opposing the dispute. Mahesh Pathak, chief of an all-India body of Hindu priests, said: “They say a temple was demolished by Aurangzeb but that is long in the past. This is all political, not religious.”However, it is the legal dispute over the 17th-century Gyanvapi mosque, constructed by Aurangzeb in the holy city of Varanasi, which is seen by many as the crucial case that could decide the fate of<g> mosques </g>across India.","What began as one petition filed by five Hindu women in 2021, seeking access to pray inside the<g><g> mosque </g></g>which they claim is built on a destroyed ancient Shiva temple, has ballooned to 15 separate petitions, with many calling for the<g><g> mosque </g></g>to be torn down and a temple built in its place. Muslims still pray at Gyanvapi five times a day, though it is surrounded with prison-like security, including concrete barriers, barbed wire and a heavy police presence.<span></span>","“This is a Hindu property, there is nothing connected to Muslims on this land,” said Anand Singh, the regional leader of Bajrang Dal, a Hindu nationalist militant organisation that has been financially and logistically supporting the Hindu legal case. “It is a Shiva temple and the current structure is an illegal structure. This is a very important moment for Hindus reclaiming their<g> history </g>and ancient glory,” he said.","One of the petitioners, Sita Sahoo, 46, admitted she had never been inside Gyanvapi but was sure that idols of Hindu deities were buried beneath the mosque, which she referred to only as a Shiva temple. “This is a holy place for all Hindus. We should have free daily access to this place for <em>darshan</em> [religious visits] and <em>puja</em> [prayer],” said Sahoo. During a hearing for the petition this month, four of the women stood outside the courtroom singing religious songs in front of dozens of eager television cameras.The situation has become more febrile since May<g> when </g>lawyers for the Hindu side<g> claimed </g>to have “found” a religious icon of Lord Shiva, known as a Shivling, inside the<g><g> mosque </g></g>during a court-ordered survey.<span></span>","Syed Mohammed Yaseen, 75, who has been the caretaker of Gyanvapi<g><g> mosque </g></g>for more than 30 years, said all these claims of Hindu iconography, idols and<g> prayer </g>inside the<g><g> mosque </g></g>were “unbelievable” and “completely untrue”. “Hindus have never prayed inside the<g><g> mosque </g></g>in its 350-year history,” he said.<span></span>","He and dozens of other regulars at the<g><g> mosque </g></g>said the alleged Shivling was in fact part of a broken fountain that has been installed at the<g><g> mosque </g></g>for about 70 years, pointing out that it has a hole through the middle for water, something never seen on a Shivling icon. It has yet to be examined by judges or experts, but the area has been sealed by the courts. The BJP told the <em>Observer</em> that it had<g> no </g>connection to the lawsuit but after the discovery of the alleged Shivling, the BJP deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh declared that “Lord Shiva has appeared where we were looking for him”.","But like many Muslims in Varanasi, Yaseen feared that in the current political climate, the case was already decided against them. “So far we haven’t seen any part of this trial to be fair,” he said. “This is a case which is being filed by Hindus and decided by Hindus, everybody is on their side: investigators, judiciary, government.

VP Singh and his taller associate BP Singh – no relation – are discussing Shamsi Jama Masjid, the mosque that has stood in this small town in Uttar Pradesh for 800 years.According to the lawyers, this grand white-domed mosque, one of the largest and oldest in India, is not a mosque at all. “No no, this is a Hindu temple,” asserted BP Singh. “It’s a very holy place for Hindus.”","Records dating back to 1856 make reference to the working mosque, and according to local Muslims, they have been praying there undisturbed since it was built by Shamsuddin Iltutmish, a Muslim king, in 1223. The Singhs however, have a different version of events. In July, they filed a court case on behalf of a local Hindu farmer – and backed by the rightwing Hindu nationalist party Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) – alleging that Shamsi Jama Masjid is not a mosque but an “illegal structure” built on a destroyed 10th-century Hindu temple for the god Shiva. Their petition states that Hindus have rightful ownership of the land and should be able to pray there.Except, the two bickering lawyers can’t quite agree on the historical facts. BP Singh initially claimed that the original Hindu temple was destroyed by a Muslim tyrant king – but then VP Singh contradicts him.","“Not destroyed, altered,” said VP Singh. “Most of the original Hindu temple is still there.” They claim as evidence a lotus flower painted on the inside of the mosque dome. But when the Observer was given access to the mosque, there was no such Hindu motif, and instead it was the calligraphy of a Qur’anic verse. There was also no sign of an alleged “hidden locked room filled with Hindu idols” in the mosque, which VP Singh claimed he had seen in the 1970s as a child. Instead, the room in question was a store cupboard, filled with cleaning materials and prayer mats.","The pair also could not settle on exactly when Shamsi Jama Masjid, which they refuse to call a mosque, began to be used by Muslims for prayer five times a day as it is today. After BP Singh stated that Muslims were praying there up till the 1800s, VP Singh leaned over to mutter quietly to his associate: “No no don’t say that, don’t say that.”","More loudly, VP Singh then proclaimed: “Actually no this wasn’t a mosque, it was never used for namaz [Muslim prayer] until recently when the Muslims forcibly occupied it and tried to convert it into a mosque.” They claimed to have “proof” but were unable to find it.“When the Muslims ruled, we Hindus were all persecuted, we were killed and tortured,” added BP Singh. “Now we are taking back what is rightfully ours.”","The case has been met by puzzlement from local Muslims, who are contesting it in court. “How can you claim this is not a mosque?,” said Anwer Alam, legal counsel for the mosque committee, pointing up to the imposing white domes. “No Hindu has ever prayed at this mosque since its inception 800 years ago. This suit has no legal grounds.”But those behind the case say Budaun is just the beginning. “We have a list of about 3,000 that we have decided to reclaim legally,” said Sanjay Hariyana, a state spokesperson for ABHM.","Since 2014, when the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government came to power, India’s 200 million minority Muslims say they have been subjected to persecution, violence and state-sponsored discrimination. Under the Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) agenda – which aims to establish India as a Hindu nation, rather than a secular state – Muslim civilians, activists and journalists have been routinely targeted, Muslim businesses boycotted and Islamophobic rhetoric used by BJP leaders, while lynching of Muslims has been on the rise. ","Mosques have begun to be caught up in a wide-ranging project under the BJP to rewrite India’s history according to Hindutva ideology. The version of history now propagated by BJP leaders, government-backed historians and school curriculums is that of an ancient Hindu nation oppressed and persecuted for hundreds of years by ruthless Muslim invaders, particularly the Islamic Mughal empire that ruled from the 16th to the 19th century.The alleged destruction of Hindu temples to build mosques has been central to this narrative. In May, a senior BJP leader claimed that Mughals had destroyed 36,000 Hindu temples and they would “reclaim all those temples one by one”.","But Richard Eaton, a professor of Indian history at the University of Arizona, said there was no historical evidence for this, with Mughals thought to have torn down only about two dozen temples. “Claims of many thousands of such instances are outlandish, irresponsible and without foundation,” he said.","Historians have accused the BJP of not only rewriting, but “inventing” India’s history in their own image. Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, a professor of Mughal history at Aligarh Muslim University, described the BJP’s polarised version of Indian history as “fantasy, nothing more than fiction” invented to serve their political agenda. “The history of India is being painted as a black and white narrative of Hindus versus Muslims,” said Rezavi. “But it was never so.”Yet Indian historians whose work contradicts this version of history, or who have spoken out, have found themselves sidelined, penalised or ousted from government bodies and academic institutions which rely on government funding. ","Rezavi is one of the few historians in India who still dare to speak; many approached by the Observer declined, citing fears over their jobs or their safety. Foreign historians have also been targeted. Audrey Truschke, a history professor at Rutgers University in the US, has faced death threats, allegedly from Hindu rightwing groups, for her work on Mughals.","Rezavi likened the attacks and silencing of historians and scholars to the targeting of academics in Nazi Germany. “A large number of historians are afraid to speak up openly,” he said. “I have been a victim of discrimination and persecution because of speaking up. But show me one Indian historian worth his salt who is with the government? There is not one.”","As the impetus to avenge and reclaim India’s history for Hindus has gained traction, dozens of petitions have been filed by right-wing Hindu groups against mosques across the country. India has a law which explicitly protects places of worship from being disputed post-1947 but judges are allowing cases. Even India’s most famous monument, the Taj Mahal, which was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, has not escaped litigation, and a case – widely derided by historians – was filed alleging it was originally a Hindu temple with locked rooms of Hindu relics. Alok Vats, a senior BJP leader, said the party had “no role” in the lawsuits but that these groups were “seeking to do exactly what the Hindu community wants”.","The cases have been further galvanised by a 2019 supreme court ruling which handed over Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque in the Uttar Pradesh town of Ayodhya, to Hindus after they claimed it was the birthplace of their god, Lord Ram. In 1992, the mosque was torn down by a rightwing Hindu mob, an incident many fear could now be repeated with the escalating number of disputed mosques. This month, a mosque in the city of Gurgaon was violently attacked by a mob of about 200, while in the state of Karnataka a Hindu crowd barged into a madrassa, placed a Hindu idol inside and performed a prayer.In Mathura, a city in Uttar Pradesh, Shahi Eidgah mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1670, is now facing 12 lawsuits claiming it is built on the birthplace of the Hindu god Lord Krishna and ruins of a Hindu temple","Muslims are fighting the case but in a city that has long prided itself on communal harmony, Hindus are also among those opposing the dispute. Mahesh Pathak, chief of an all-India body of Hindu priests, said: “They say a temple was demolished by Aurangzeb but that is long in the past. This is all political, not religious.”However, it is the legal dispute over the 17th-century Gyanvapi mosque, constructed by Aurangzeb in the holy city of Varanasi, which is seen by many as the crucial case that could decide the fate of mosques across India.","What began as one petition filed by five Hindu women in 2021, seeking access to pray inside the mosque which they claim is built on a destroyed ancient Shiva temple, has ballooned to 15 separate petitions, with many calling for the mosque to be torn down and a temple built in its place. Muslims still pray at Gyanvapi five times a day, though it is surrounded with prison-like security, including concrete barriers, barbed wire and a heavy police presence.","“This is a Hindu property, there is nothing connected to Muslims on this land,” said Anand Singh, the regional leader of Bajrang Dal, a Hindu nationalist militant organisation that has been financially and logistically supporting the Hindu legal case. “It is a Shiva temple and the current structure is an illegal structure. This is a very important moment for Hindus reclaiming their history and ancient glory,” he said.","One of the petitioners, Sita Sahoo, 46, admitted she had never been inside Gyanvapi but was sure that idols of Hindu deities were buried beneath the mosque, which she referred to only as a Shiva temple. “This is a holy place for all Hindus. We should have free daily access to this place for darshan [religious visits] and puja [prayer],” said Sahoo. During a hearing for the petition this month, four of the women stood outside the courtroom singing religious songs in front of dozens of eager television cameras.The situation has become more febrile since May when lawyers for the Hindu side claimed to have “found” a religious icon of Lord Shiva, known as a Shivling, inside the mosque during a court-ordered survey.","Syed Mohammed Yaseen, 75, who has been the caretaker of Gyanvapi mosque for more than 30 years, said all these claims of Hindu iconography, idols and prayer inside the mosque were “unbelievable” and “completely untrue”. “Hindus have never prayed inside the mosque in its 350-year history,” he said.","He and dozens of other regulars at the mosque said the alleged Shivling was in fact part of a broken fountain that has been installed at the mosque for about 70 years, pointing out that it has a hole through the middle for water, something never seen on a Shivling icon. It has yet to be examined by judges or experts, but the area has been sealed by the courts. The BJP told the Observer that it had no connection to the lawsuit but after the discovery of the alleged Shivling, the BJP deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh declared that “Lord Shiva has appeared where we were looking for him”.","But like many Muslims in Varanasi, Yaseen feared that in the current political climate, the case was already decided against them. “So far we haven’t seen any part of this trial to be fair,” he said. “This is a case which is being filed by Hindus and decided by Hindus, everybody is on their side: investigators, judiciary, government. I tried my best to appoint a Hindu lawyer but no Hindu lawyer would fight for us.”Abdul Batin Nomani, the grand mufti of Varanasi, who oversees all mosques in the city, was equally pessimistic. “We know this mosque is just the beginning,” he said “But if they hand it to the Hindus, there will be bloodshed.”Topics"],"catagory":"history","url":"https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/30/thousands-of-mosques-targeted-as-hindu-nationalists-try-to-rewrite-indias-history"},{"image":"https://brazilian.report/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/voz_do_brasil_vac_abr_2704223610.jpg","title":"Highway Police boss subpoenaed for alleged voter suppression","slides":["<span> Oct 30, 2022 13:08 </span> <span> 2 min read </span>  <span> (Updated: Oct 30, 2022 15:19) </span> ","Former President Luiz Inácio Lula<g> da </g>Silva’s campaign on Sunday requested the Superior Electoral Court to subpoena the head of Brazil’s Federal Highway Police for several cases of<g> alleged </g>voter suppression.","Videos and photos published on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CentralEleicoes/status/1586742859507634183\">social media</a> show Federal Highway Police agents conducting operations in several Brazilian states, causing traffic jams in mostly<g> rural </g>areas.

Why should we care about a distant and quite obscure historical event?\n","\n                    ﻿﻿On Wednesday, October 26, as part of the 19th Annual Meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, four thematic sessions were held on humanitarian issues - values, communications and technology. During a special session, held as an open discussion, the experts discussed the image of Russia in the world.                <a href=\"/events/posts/\">\n                    Club events                </a>\n            ","\n\t First, because the greatest liberation project of our times, that of Marx and Engels, to create an international organisation of the working class, has come to an end. There has been no such organisation for eighty years.\n","\n\t But second, until 1943 there was such an organization, whatever criticism one may make of it. Throughout the world, there were Communist Parties who organised both to fight for socialism and to oppose imperialism, and they were part of an international organisation. The Bolsheviks invested every bit as much in the creation of the Communist International, as they did in the creation of the soviet state. The two projects were in effect Siamese twins. So surely, now that Russia is re-evaluating the second of these great projects, it is time to reflect critically on the first.\n\n\t True, this international organisation acted, in effect, as an instrument of soviet statecraft, and this is to be discussed. But there is no doubt it was a player on the<g> world </g>stage.\n","\n\t Its<g> parties </g>numbered<g> tens </g>of<g> millions </g>in Germany, Italy, France. We can judge their importance from the effect of their defeat: the way to World War II was prepared by destroying them. That was the purpose of fascism, which we should not forget in choosing our allies.\n\n\t So why was the Comintern dissolved?\n","\n\t Because at the international conferences of Yalta and Tehran, between Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt, Soviet leaders believed the USSR would be allowed to develop peacefully, if they could assure the Allies that the USSR would not interfere in their affairs.\n","\n\t By dissolving the Comintern, the USSR undertook to cease acting as an organiser of the Communist Parties. They would act on their own, as purely national parties. But there was collateral damage, almost noticed because of the priority that Soviet leaders gave to<g> its </g>function as an instrument of statecraft, at the same time this dissolution also deprived them of the ability to work together for joint and mutually beneficial ends.\n\n\t It deprived the<g> world </g>working class of the capacity to confront<g> world </g>capital on the<g> world </g>stage.\n\n\t In return, they hoped, the West would respect the ideals of non-intervention on which the UN was founded.\n\n\t For a long time it seemed as if the deal was holding: the Collective West did little to interfere in the affairs of USSR, and what little it did was ineffective.\n\n\t But this was not because of goodwill. It was because of the military might of the USSR.\n","\n\t The collective West never respected non-intervention in the third world. And they conspired in every way to bring down the USSR and got a spectacular result: the USSR committed suicide. Its collapse didn’t appear to be their work, making it seem as if the West, even after the USSR was gone, would respect non-intervention. \n\n<!-- section-full-width-end -->                        \n                     The belief that the West would refrain from intervention if the USSR did, was hence a catastrophic misjudgement. It was a bargain that only one side kept.                 "," As soon as USSR was gone, the West’s pretence of non-intervention was unceremoniously dropped. It embarked on<g> its </g>aggressive programme of NATO expansion. It intervened militarily in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Haiti, and Syria, weaponised economic sanctions, and set about converting international agencies into instruments of<g> its </g>power, making regime change an explicit and public aim.\n\n\t So if time permits, I should now like to suggest a response.\n","\n\t This is to find ways to return to the agenda of Marx and Engels; to seek, jointly with our partners in the global south and based on their struggles, international organisations of Civil Society, including partners in the collective West, in which the<g> peoples </g>of the<g> world </g>will have their own say, independent of their governments.\n","\n\t The principles on which these are based should seek to rule out their being used by any government to pursue<g> its </g>own ends in other countries. They should renounce, and guard against this, in their statutes and actions.\n","\n\t This means that, like the Comintern, they will be committed first and foremost to put an end to the only actual and present real threat to national sovereignty: the Collective West’s military and economic interventionism.\n\n\t That is, their first duty is to defend the rights of the pluripolar global South to pursue<g> its </g>course of independent national and mutual development.\n","\n\t The advantages to Russia, and all<g> its </g>partners, are obvious: it will put an end to ‘shopping for friends’ in the West – looking for some break in the ranks such as Trump. It will also put an end to the dangerous process in which the alliances sought by one country threaten another: let us not forget that Trump is far and away the most aggressive enemy of Latin America.\n","\n\t But second, because it will be genuinely independent of all governments, it will put an end to the Western practice of using civil society movements as instruments of statecraft.

There are just over 2.1 million votes separating the two candidates with 99.99% of votes counted.","In 2018, Bolsonaro took the lead with over 10 million votes more than Worker's Party candidate Fernando Haddad.","For incumbent Bolsonaro, it's a historic loss, as he became the first<g> president </g>to stand for re-election and lose.","In Brazil, presidents have been able to run for a second term since 1997, and all who have done so, apart from Bolsonaro, have succeeded.Lula supporters are celebrating - but one couple has another reason to smile. ","This video appears to show a marriage proposal happening among crowds of supporters in Rio minutes before Lula's win was announced.Will GrantBBC News, HavanaThe sighs of relief from Havana and Caracas once Lula's win was confirmed were almost audible. ","Regaining an ideological ally at the helm of such a powerful nation as Brazil instead of such a vocal enemy as Jair Bolsonaro was vitally important for the Latin American left.","Cuba, unsurprisingly, among the first governments to recognise their old ally's victory, and the island's president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, posted a recent photograph on Twitter of himself, Raul Castro and Lula clasped by the hands. ","But beyond warm words from sympathetic foreign ministers, Lula's<g> return </g>may prove crucial to shaping the political landscape of modern Latin America. ","Left-wing victories in Chile and Peru haven't necessarily provided the kind of unified bloc in the region which Venezuela and Cuba enjoyed under the so-called \"Pink Tide\" led by Hugo Chavez at the turn of the 21st Century. ","Rather, their support has been contained to the increasingly authoritarian Cold War warrior, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, and to an extent, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico. ","The second coming of Lula -- a man who was always impressively adept at working with both Washington and Havana, with both Hugo Chavez and George W Bush -- may provide a vital tonic to their ailing economies. ","As we've been reporting, Brazil's incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro lost the elections and former leftist President Luiz Inácio 'Lula' da Silva has won.Lula will take office on 1 January 2023 and Bolsonaro will remain in office until then.Lula gave a speech earlier this evening - we are still waiting to hear from the Bolsonaro camp.

It was always expected to be a close race but it really was a nail-biter to the end.","As we've been reporting, today is a momentous day for Brazilians, as an extremely divided country went to the polls to choose their next president. Governors were also chosen during this year's elections. ","Many were elected during the first round on 2 October, but 12 states in Brazil - out of the country's 26 states and federal district - elected governors who will lead them during the next four years.Watch the reaction from both camps as Lula is declared the winner of Brazil's election.<span data-reactid=\".2fqay9uw7w6.0.2.0.0.1.0.1.0.$lx-tabs0.0.$lx-commentary.$lx-commentary.2.0.1.1.1:$post-635f13e7f15ea55905e404cc.0.6.0.0:$post_0.0.1.1\">Copyright: Reuters</span>Lula says his government will fight to cut deforestation in the Amazon to zero.","Promising to crack<g> down </g>on illegal activity in the rainforest, Lula says: \"Brazil and the planet need an Amazon alive and breathing.

At about 10 p.m. local time, three hours after the results were in, the lights went out in the presidential palace and Bolsonaro had not conceded nor reacted in any way. Before the vote, Bolsonaro’s campaign had made repeated — unproven — claims of possible electoral manipulation, raising fears that he would not accept defeat and would challenge the results if he lost.The high-stakes election was a stunning reversal for<g> da </g>Silva, 77, whose imprisonment for corruption sidelined him from the 2018 election that brought Bolsonaro, a defender of conservative<g> social </g>values, to power.","“Today the only winner is the Brazilian people,”<g> da </g>Silva said in a speech at a hotel in downtown Sao Paulo. “This isn’t a victory of mine or the Workers’ Party, nor the parties that supported me in campaign. It’s the victory of a democratic movement that formed<g> above </g>political parties, personal interests and ideologies so that democracy came out victorious.”","Da Silva is promising to govern beyond his party. He wants to bring in centrists and even some leaning to the right who voted for him for the first time, and to restore the country’s more prosperous past. Yet he faces headwinds in a politically polarized society where<g> economic </g>growth is forecast to slow and inflation remains high.","This was the country’s tightest election since its return to democracy in 1985, and the first time that a sitting<g> president </g>failed to win reelection. Just over 2 million votes separated the two candidates; the previous closest race, in 2014, was decided by a margin of roughly 3.5 million votes.The highly polarized election in Latin America’s biggest economy extended a wave of recent leftist victories in the region, including Chile, Colombia and Argentina. Da Silva’s inauguration is scheduled to take place on Jan. 1. He last served as<g> president </g>from 2003-2010.Thomas Traumann, an independent political analyst, compared the results to Biden’s 2020 victory, saying<g> da </g>Silva is inheriting an extremely divided nation.","“The huge challenge that Lula has will be to pacify the country,” he said. “People are not only polarized on political matters, but also have different values, identity and opinions. What’s more, they don’t care what the other side’s values, identities and opinions are.”","Congratulations for<g> da </g>Silva — and Brazil — began to pour in from around Latin America and across the world Sunday evening, including from U.S. President Joe Biden, who highlighted the country’s “free, fair, and credible elections.” The European Union also congratulated<g> da </g>Silva in a statement, commending the electoral authority for its effectiveness and transparency throughout the campaign.","Bolsonaro had been leading throughout the first half of the count and, as soon as<g> da </g>Silva overtook him, cars in the streets of downtown Sao Paulo began honking their horns. People in the streets of Rio de Janeiro’s Ipanema neighborhood could be heard shouting, “It turned!”Da Silva’s headquarters in downtown Sao Paulo hotel only erupted once the final result was announced, underscoring the tension that was a hallmark of this race.“Four years waiting for this,” said Gabriela Souto, one of the few supporters allowed in due to heavy security.","Outside Bolsonaro’s home in Rio, ground-zero for his support base, a woman atop a truck delivered a prayer over a speaker, then sang excitedly, trying to generate some energy as the tally grew for<g> da </g>Silva. But supporters decked out in the green and yellow of the flag barely responded. Many perked up when the national anthem played, singing along loudly with hands over their hearts.For months, it appeared that<g> da </g>Silva was headed for easy victory as he kindled nostalgia for his presidency, when Brazil’s economy was booming and<g> welfare </g>helped<g> tens </g>of<g> millions </g>join the<g> middle </g>class.But while<g> da </g>Silva topped the Oct. 2 first-round elections with 48% of the vote, Bolsonaro was a strong second at 43%, showing opinion polls significantly had underestimated his popularity. ","Bolsonaro’s administration has been marked by incendiary speech, his testing of democratic institutions, his widely criticized handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in 15 years. But he has<g> built </g>a devoted base by defending conservative values and presenting himself as protection from leftist policies that he says infringe on personal liberties and produce<g> economic </g>turmoil. And he shored up support in an election year with vast government spending.“We did not face an opponent, a candidate. We faced the machine of the Brazilian state put at his service so we could not win the election,”<g> da </g>Silva told the crowd in Sao Paulo.","Da Silva<g> built </g>an<g> extensive </g>social<g> welfare </g>program<g> during </g>his<g> tenure </g>that<g> helped </g>lift<g> tens </g>of<g> millions </g>into the<g> middle </g>class. The<g> man </g>universally<g> known </g>as Lula also<g> presided </g>over an<g> economic </g>boom,<g> leaving </g>office with an<g> approval </g>rating<g> above </g>80%,<g> prompting </g>then U.S. President Barack Obama to call him “the most popular politician on Earth.” ","But he is also remembered for his administration’s involvement in vast corruption revealed by sprawling investigations. Da Silva’s arrest in 2018 kept him out of that year’s race against Bolsonaro, a fringe lawmaker at the time who was an outspoken fan of former U.S. President Donald Trump. ","Da Silva was jailed for for 580 days for corruption and money laundering. His convictions were later annulled by Brazil’s top court, which ruled the presiding judge had been biased and colluded with prosecutors. That enabled<g> da </g>Silva to run for the nation’s highest<g> office </g>for the sixth time. Da Silva has pledged to boost spending on the poor, reestablish relationships with foreign governments and take bold action to eliminate illegal clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest. “We will once<g> again </g>monitor and do surveillance in the Amazon. We will fight every illegal activity,”<g> da </g>Silva said in his acceptance speech. “At the same time we will promote sustainable development of the communities of the Amazon.”The president-elect has pledged to install a ministry for Brazil’s original peoples, which will be run by an Indigenous person.But as<g> da </g>Silva tries to achieve these and other goals, he will be confronted by strong opposition from conservative lawmakers likely to take their cues from Bolsonaro. Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, compared the likely political climate to that experienced by former President Dilma Rousseff,<g> da </g>Silva’s hand-picked successor after his second term.","“Lula’s victory means Brazil is trying to overcome years of turbulence since the reelection of President Dilma Rousseff in 2014. That election never ended; the opposition asked for a recount, she governed under pressure and was impeached two years later,” said Melo. “The divide became huge and then made Bolsonaro.”","Unemployment this year has fallen to its lowest level since 2015 and, although overall inflation has slowed<g> during </g>the campaign, food prices are increasing at a double-digit rate. Bolsonaro’s<g> welfare </g>payments<g> helped </g>many Brazilians get by, but<g> da </g>Silva has been presenting himself as the candidate more willing to sustain aid going forward and raise the minimum wage. In April, he tapped center-right Geraldo Alckmin, a former rival, to be his running mate. It was another key part of an effort to create a broad, pro-democracy front to not just unseat Bolsonaro, but to make it easier to govern. ","“If Lula manages to talk to voters who didn’t vote for him, which Bolsonaro never tried, and seeks negotiated solutions to the economic,<g> social </g>and political crisis we have, and links with other nations that were lost, then he could reconnect Brazil to a time in which people could disagree and still get some things done,” Melo said. ___Carla Bridi contributed to this report from Brasilia.

Da Silva’s arrest in 2018 kept him out of that year’s race against Bolsonaro, a fringe lawmaker at the time who was an outspoken fan of former U.S. President Donald Trump. ","Da Silva was jailed for for 580 days for corruption and money laundering. His convictions were later annulled by Brazil’s top court, which ruled the presiding judge had been biased and colluded with prosecutors. That enabled da Silva to run for the nation’s highest office for the sixth time. Da Silva has pledged to boost spending on the poor, reestablish relationships with foreign governments and take bold action to eliminate illegal clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest. “We will once again monitor and do surveillance in the Amazon. We will fight every illegal activity,” da Silva said in his acceptance speech. “At the same time we will promote sustainable development of the communities of the Amazon.”The president-elect has pledged to install a ministry for Brazil’s original peoples, which will be run by an Indigenous person.But as da Silva tries to achieve these and other goals, he will be confronted by strong opposition from conservative lawmakers likely to take their cues from Bolsonaro. Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, compared the likely political climate to that experienced by former President Dilma Rousseff, da Silva’s hand-picked successor after his second term.","“Lula’s victory means Brazil is trying to overcome years of turbulence since the reelection of President Dilma Rousseff in 2014. That election never ended; the opposition asked for a recount, she governed under pressure and was impeached two years later,” said Melo. “The divide became huge and then made Bolsonaro.”","Unemployment this year has fallen to its lowest level since 2015 and, although overall inflation has slowed during the campaign, food prices are increasing at a double-digit rate. Bolsonaro’s welfare payments helped many Brazilians get by, but da Silva has been presenting himself as the candidate more willing to sustain aid going forward and raise the minimum wage. In April, he tapped center-right Geraldo Alckmin, a former rival, to be his running mate. It was another key part of an effort to create a broad, pro-democracy front to not just unseat Bolsonaro, but to make it easier to govern. ","“If Lula manages to talk to voters who didn’t vote for him, which Bolsonaro never tried, and seeks negotiated solutions to the economic, social and political crisis we have, and links with other nations that were lost, then he could reconnect Brazil to a time in which people could disagree and still get some things done,” Melo said. ___Carla Bridi contributed to this report from Brasilia.
