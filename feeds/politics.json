                "Beschloss agreed with other experts and pundits that political violence threatens the country.

He said Trump “encouraged violence at his rallies” beginning back in 2015 during his campaign, and “did this periodically as president of the United States.”Phang also featured a dire warning from presidential historian Jon Meacham during an earlier appearance on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” ",
                "“One of the marks of the end of a republic is the normalization of political violence,” Meacham said Friday. “It just is. And everybody needs to remember, including us, that what we say matters, that words have consequences, and that things that seem improbable one hour can happen in the next.”“Violent acts can change history,” he added. “And a mature democratic society ― lowercase ‘d’ ― has to have a way where we mediate our political differences without political violence.” Check out the full interview with Beschloss:"

                "Six days before a<g> local </g>runoff election last year in Frisco, a prosperous and growing suburb of Dallas, Brandon Burden paced the stage of KingdomLife Church. The pastor<g> told </g>congregants that demonic spirits were operating through<g> members </g>of the City Council.",
                "Grasping his Bible with both hands, Burden said God was working through his North Texas congregation to take the country back to its Christian roots. He lamented that he lacked jurisdiction over the state Capitol, where he had gone during the<g> 2021 </g>Texas legislative session to lobby for conservative priorities like expanded gun rights and a ban on abortion.",
                "“But you know what I got jurisdiction over this morning is an election coming up on Saturday,” Burden<g> told </g>parishioners. “I got a candidate that God wants to win. I got a mayor that God wants to unseat. God wants to undo. God wants to shift the balance of power in our city. And I have jurisdiction over that this morning.”",
                "What Burden said that<g> day </g>in May<g> 2021 </g>was a violation of a long-standing federal<g> law </g>barring<g><g> churches </g></g>and nonprofits from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, tax<g> law </g>experts<g> told </g>ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. Although the provision was mostly uncontroversial for decades after it passed in 1954, it has become a target for both evangelical<g><g> churches </g></g>and former President Donald Trump, who vowed to eliminate it.",
                "Burden’s sermon is<g> among </g>those at 18<g><g> churches </g></g>identified by the news organizations over the past two years that appeared to violate the Johnson Amendment, a measure named after its author, former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Some<g> pastors </g>have gone so far as to paint<g> candidates </g>they oppose as demonic.",
                "At one point,<g><g> churches </g></g>fretted over losing their tax-exempt status for even unintentional missteps. But the IRS has largely abdicated its enforcement responsibilities as<g><g> churches </g></g>have become more brazen. In fact, the number of apparent violations found by ProPublica and the Tribune, and confirmed by three nonprofit tax<g> law </g>experts, are greater than the total number of<g><g> churches </g></g>the federal agency has investigated for intervening in political campaigns over the past decade, according to records obtained by the news organizations.",
                "In response to questions, an IRS spokesperson said that the agency “cannot comment on, neither confirm nor deny, investigations in progress, completed in the past nor contemplated.” Asked about enforcement efforts over the past decade, the IRS pointed the news organizations to annual reports that do not contain such information.Neither Burden nor KingdomLife responded to multiple interview requests or to emailed questions.\n                                <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/48F5mxH0rKM\"></iframe>\n            \n        ",
                "Trump’s opposition to the<g> law </g>banning political activity by nonprofits “has given some politically-minded evangelical<g> leaders </g>a sense that the Johnson Amendment<g> just </g>isn’t really an issue anymore, and that they can go ahead and campaign for or against<g> candidates </g>or positions from the pulpit,” said David Brockman, a scholar in religion and public policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.",
                "Among the violations the newsrooms identified: In January, an Alaska pastor<g> told </g>his congregation that he was<g> voting </g>for a GOP candidate who is aiming to unseat <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001153-lisa-murkowski\">Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski</a>, saying the challenger was the “only candidate for Senate that can flat-out preach.” During a May 15 sermon, a pastor in Rocklin, California, asked voters to get behind “a Christian conservative candidate” challenging Gov. Gavin Newsom. And in July, a New Mexico pastor called Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham “beyond evil” and “demonic” for supporting abortion access. He urged congregants to “vote her behind right out of office” and challenged the media to call him out for violating the Johnson Amendment.",
                "Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at the University of Indiana-Purdue, who studies Christian nationalism, said the ramping up of political activity by<g><g> churches </g></g>could further polarize the country. “It creates hurdles for a healthy, functioning, pluralistic democratic society,” he said. “It’s really hard to overcome.”",
                "The Johnson Amendment does not prohibit<g><g> churches </g></g>from inviting political speakers or discussing positions that may seem partisan nor does it restrict voters from making faith-based decisions on who should represent them. But because donations to<g><g> churches </g></g>are tax-deductible and because<g><g> churches </g></g>don’t have to file financial disclosures with the IRS, without such a rule donors<g> seeking </g>to influence<g><g><g> elections </g></g></g>could go undetected, said Andrew Seidel, vice president of strategic communications for the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.“If you pair the ability to wade into partisan politics with a total absence of financial oversight and transparency, you’re essentially creating super PACs that are black holes,” Seidel said.",
                "Churches have long balanced the tightrope of political involvement, and blatant violations have previously been rare. In the 1960s, the IRS investigated complaints that some<g><g> churches </g></g>abused their tax-exempt status by distributing literature that was hostile to the election of John F. Kennedy, the country’s first Catholic president. And in 2004, the federal agency audited All Saints Episcopal Church in California after a pastor gave an anti-war speech that imagined Jesus talking to presidential<g> candidates </g>George W. Bush and John Kerry. The pastor did not endorse a candidate but criticized the Iraq war.",
                "Some conservative groups have argued that Black<g><g> churches </g></g>are more politically active than their white evangelical counterparts but are not as heavily scrutinized. During the 1984 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was accused of turning Sunday sermons into campaign rallies and using Black<g><g> churches </g></g>to raise funds. In response to allegations of illegal campaigning, Jackson said at the time that strict guidelines were followed and denied violating the law.",
                "While some Black<g><g> churches </g></g>have crossed the line into political endorsements, the long legacy of political activism in these<g><g> churches </g></g>stands in sharp contrast to white evangelical churches, where some<g> pastors </g>argue devout Christians must take control of government positions, said Robert Wuthnow, the former director of the Princeton University Center for the Study of Religion.Wuthnow said long-standing voter outreach efforts inside Black churches, such as Souls to the Polls, which encourages<g> voting </g>on Sundays after<g> church </g>services, largely stay within the boundaries of the law.",
                "“The Black<g> church </g>has been so keenly aware of its marginalized position,” Wuthnow said. “The Black church, historically, was the one place where Black people could mobilize, could organize, could feel that they had some power at the<g> local </g>level. The white evangelical<g> church </g>has power. It’s in office. It’s always had power.”At the end of his two-hour sermon that May, Burden asserted that his<g> church </g>had a God-given power to choose lawmakers, and he asked others to join him onstage to “secure the gate over the city.”",
                "Burden and a handful of<g> church </g>members crouched down and held on to a rod, at times speaking in tongues. The pastor said intruders such as the mayor, who was not up for reelection last year but who supported one of the<g> candidates </g>in the race for City Council, would be denied access to the gates of the city.“Now this is bold, but I’m going to<g> say </g>it because I felt it from the Lord. I felt the Lord say, ‘Revoke the mayor’s keys to this gate,’” Burden said. “No more do you have the key to the city. We revoke your key this morning, Mr. Mayor.“We shut you out of the place of power,” Burden added. “The place of authority and influence.”Questions about the political involvement of tax-exempt organizations were swirling when Congress ordered an investigation in April 1952 to determine if some foundations were using their money “for un-American and subversive activities.”",
                "Leading the probe was Rep. Gene Cox, a Georgia Democrat who had accused the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations,<g> among </g>others, of helping alleged Communists or Communist fronts. Cox died during the investigation, and the final report cleared the foundations of wrongdoing.",
                "But a Republican member of the committee argued for additional scrutiny, and in July 1953, Congress established the House Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. The committee focused heavily on liberal organizations, but it also investigated nonprofits such as the Facts Forum foundation, which was headed by Texas oilman H.L. Hunt, an ardent supporter of then-Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, a Republican who was best known for holding hearings to investigate suspected Communists.",
                "In July 1954, Johnson, who was then a senator, proposed an amendment to the U.S. tax code that would strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status for “intervening” in political campaigns. The amendment sailed through Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into<g> law </g>by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower.",
                "Johnson never explained his intent. Opponents of the amendment, <a href=\"https://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2061/Issue%205/combest.pdf\">as well as some academics</a>,<g> say </g>Johnson was motivated by a <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2606&amp;context=caselrev\">desire to undercut conservative foundations</a> such as the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, founded by newspaper magnate Frank Gannett, which painted the Democrat as soft on communism and supported his opponent in the primary election. <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=caselrev\">Others have hypothesized</a> that Johnson was hoping to head off a wider crackdown on nonprofit foundations.Over the next 40 years, the IRS stripped a handful of religious nonprofits of their tax-exempt status. None were churches.",
                "Then,<g> just </g>four days before the 1992 presidential election, Branch Ministries in New York ran two full-page ads in USA Today and The Washington Times urging voters to reject then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in his challenge to Republican President George H.W. Bush.",
                "The ads proclaimed: “Christian Beware. Do not put the economy ahead of the Ten Commandments.” They asserted that Clinton violated scripture by supporting “abortion on demand,” homosexuality and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in public schools. Clinton, the ads said, was “openly promoting policies that are in rebellion to God’s laws.”The IRS revoked the church’s tax-exempt status, leading to a long legal battle that ended with a <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/branch-ministries-v-rossotti\">U.S. appeals court siding with the federal agency</a>.",
                "The case remains the only publicly known example of the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of a<g> church </g>because of its political activity in nearly 70 years. The Congressional Research Service said in 2012 that a <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL34447.html\">second<g> church </g>had </a><a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL34447.html\">lost its tax-exempt status, but that its identity “is not clear.”</a>Citing an increase in allegations of<g> church </g>political activity leading up to the 2004 presidential election between incumbent Bush and Kerry, IRS officials created the Political Activities Compliance Initiative to <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/paci_procedures_feb_22_2006.pdf\">fast-track investigations</a>.",
                "Over the next four years, the committee investigated <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/2006paci_report_5-30-07.pdf\">scores of churches</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/fy2011_eo_workplan.pdf\">80 for<g> endorsing </g>candidates</a> from the pulpit, according to IRS reports. But it did not revoke the tax-exempt status of any. Instead, the IRS mostly sent warning letters that agency officials said were effective in dissuading<g><g> churches </g></g>from continuing their political activity, asserting that there were no repeat offenders in that period.In some cases, the IRS initiated audits of<g><g> churches </g></g>that could have led to financial penalties. It’s unclear how many did.In January 2009, a <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/minnesota/mndce/0:2008mc00037/101893/26/\">federal court dismissed an audit</a><a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/minnesota/mndce/0:2008mc00037/101893/26/\"> </a>into alleged financial improprieties at a Minnesota<g> church </g>whose pastor had supported the congressional campaign of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota.",
                "The court found that the IRS had not been following its own rules for a decade because it was tasked with notifying<g><g> churches </g></g>of their legal rights before any pending audits and was required to have an appropriately high-level official sign off on them. But a 1998 agency reorganization had eliminated the position, leaving lower IRS employees to initiate<g> church </g>investigations.Following the ruling, the IRS suspended its investigations into<g> church </g>political activity for five years, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-514.pdf\">2015 Government Accountability Office report</a>.",
                "During the hiatus, a conservative Christian initiative called Pulpit Freedom Sunday flourished. Pastors recorded themselves<g> endorsing </g>candidates or giving political sermons that they believed violated the Johnson Amendment and sent them to the IRS. The goal, according to participants, was to trigger <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/defiant-pastors-irs-pulpit-freedom-sunday/story?id=11726610\">a lawsuit that would lead to the prohibition being ruled unconstitutional</a> by the U.S. Supreme Court.The IRS never challenged participating churches, and the effort wound down without achieving its aim.",
                "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from ProPublica and the Tribune last year, the IRS produced a severely redacted spreadsheet indicating the agency had launched inquiries into 16<g><g> churches </g></g>since 2011. IRS officials shielded the results of the probes, and they have declined to answer specific questions.Despite the agency’s limited enforcement, Trump promised shortly after he took<g> office </g>that he would “totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.”",
                "As president, Trump tried unsuccessfully to remove the restrictions on<g> church </g>politicking through a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/jul/18/donald-trump/trump-claims-he-got-rid-johnson-amendment-true/\">executive order</a>. The move was largely symbolic because it simply ordered the government not to punish<g><g> churches </g></g>differently than it would any other nonprofit, according to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/25/critics-said-trumps-religious-liberty-order-does-nothing-the-administrations-lawyers-seem-to-agree/\">legal filing</a> by the Justice Department.Eliminating the Johnson Amendment would require congressional or judicial action.Although the IRS has not discussed its plans, it has taken procedural steps that would enable it to ramp up audits again if it chooses to.",
                "In 2019, more than two decades after eliminating the high-level position needed to sign off on action against churches, the IRS designated the commissioner of the agency’s tax-exempt and government entities division as the “appropriate high-level Treasury official” with the power to initiate a<g> church </g>audit.But Philip Hackney, a former IRS attorney and University of Pittsburgh tax<g> law </g>professor, said he doesn’t read too much into that. “I don’t see any reason to believe that the operation of the IRS has changed significantly.”",
                "There is no uniform way to monitor<g> church </g>sermons<g> across </g>the country. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, many<g><g> churches </g></g>now post their services online, and ProPublica and the Tribune reviewed dozens of them. Many readers shared sermons with us. (You can do so <a href=\"https://propublica.forms.fm/tell-us-how-religious-organizations-in-your-area-involve-themselves-in-elections\">here</a>.)Texas’ large evangelical population and history of activism in Black<g><g> churches </g></g>makes the state a focal point for debates over political activity, said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.",
                "“Combine all of that with the increasing competitiveness of Texas elections, and it’s no surprise that more and more Texas<g><g> churches </g></g>are taking on a political role,” he said. “Texas is a perfect arena for widespread, religiously motivated political activism.”",
                "The state also has a long history of politically minded pastors, Wuthnow said. Texas evangelical<g> church </g>leaders joined the fight in support of alcohol prohibition a century ago and spearheaded efforts to defeat Democrat Al Smith, the first Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party, in 1928. In the 1940s, evangelical fundamentalism<g> began </g>to grow in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.",
                "Today, North Texas remains home to influential<g> pastors </g>such as Robert Jeffress, who leads the First Baptist megachurch in Dallas. Jeffress was one of Trump’s most fervent supporters, appearing at campaign events, defending him on television news shows and stating that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/534014-jeffress-says-he-absolutely-does-not-regret-supporting-trump-after/\">he “absolutely” did not regret supporting the former president</a> after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.",
                "Burden went a step further, urging followers to stock up on food and keep their guns loaded ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. He<g> told </g>parishioners that “prophetic voices” had<g> told </g>him in 2016 that Trump would have eight consecutive years in office.The Frisco Conservative Coalition<g> board </g><a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/01/29/frisco-pastors-conservative-pac-loses-board-members-in-the-fallout-from-his-comments-about-trump-guns/\">voted to suspend</a> Burden as chair for 30 days after criticism about his remarks.Burden called his comments “inartful” but claimed he was unfairly targeted for his views. “The establishment media is coming after me,” he said<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKzTHYatYDI\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKzTHYatYDI\">at the time</a>. “But it is not<g> just </g>about me. People of faith are under attack in this country.”Since then, Burden has repeatedly preached that the<g> church </g>has been designated by the Lord to decide who should serve in public<g> office </g>and “take dominion” over Frisco.",
                "As the runoff for the Frisco City Council approached last year, Burden supported Jennifer White, a<g> local </g>veterinarian. White had positioned herself as the conservative candidate in the nonpartisan race against Angelia Pelham, a Black human resources executive who had the backing of the Frisco mayor.",
                "White said she wasn’t in attendance during the May<g> 2021 </g>sermon in which Burden called her the “candidate that God wants to win.” She said she does not believe<g> pastors </g>should endorse<g> candidates </g>from the pulpit, but she welcomed<g><g> churches </g></g>becoming more politically active.",
                "“I think that the<g><g> churches </g></g>over the years have been a big pretty big disappointment to the<g> candidates </g>in that they won't take a political stance,” White said in an interview. “So I would love it if<g><g> churches </g></g>would go ahead and come out and actually<g> discuss </g>things like morality. Not a specific party, but at least make sure people know where the<g> candidates </g>stand on those issues.

                "In May 2021, Pelham<g> told </g>his<g> church </g>that the race for a seat on the City Council had resulted in a runoff. He acknowledged that his church’s tax-exempt status prevented him from supporting<g> candidates </g>from the pulpit. Then, he added, “but you’ll get the message.”“It’s been declared for the two<g> candidates </g>who received the most votes, one of which is my wife,” Pelham said. “That’s<g> just </g>facts. That’s<g> just </g>facts. That’s<g> just </g>facts. And so a runoff is coming and every vote counts. Be sure to vote.”Pelham then asked the congregation: “How did I do? I did all right, didn’t I? You know I wanted to go a little further, but I didn’t do it.”Angelia Pelham, who co-founded Life-Changing Faith Christian Fellowship in 2008 with her husband, said the couple tried to avoid violating the Johnson Amendment. Both disagreed that her husband’s mention of her candidacy was a violation.",
                "“I think<g> church </g>and state should remain separate,” Angelia Pelham said in an interview, adding: “But I think there’s a lot of folks in the religious setting that<g> just </g>completely didn’t even consider the line. They erased it completely and lost sight of the Johnson Amendment.”She declined to<g> discuss </g>Burden’s endorsement of her opponent.In his sermon the morning after Pelham defeated his chosen candidate, Burden<g> told </g>parishioners that the church’s political involvement would continue.“So you’re like, but you lost last night? No, we set the stage for the future,” he said, adding “God is uncovering the demonic structure that is in this region.”Most Americans don’t want<g> pastors </g>making endorsements from the pulpit, according <a href=\"https://publicconsultation.org/united-states/overwhelming-bi-partisan-majority-opposes-allowing-churches-other-nonprofits-to-engage-in-political-activity/\">to a 2017 survey</a> by the Program for Public Consultation, which is part of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland.Of the nearly 2,500 registered voters who were surveyed, 79% opposed getting rid of the Johnson Amendment.

                "Six days before a local runoff election last year in Frisco, a prosperous and growing suburb of Dallas, Brandon Burden paced the stage of KingdomLife Church. The pastor told congregants that demonic spirits were operating through members of the City Council.",
                "Grasping his Bible with both hands, Burden said God was working through his North Texas congregation to take the country back to its Christian roots. He lamented that he lacked jurisdiction over the state Capitol, where he had gone during the 2021 Texas legislative session to lobby for conservative priorities like expanded gun rights and a ban on abortion.",
                "“But you know what I got jurisdiction over this morning is an election coming up on Saturday,” Burden told parishioners. “I got a candidate that God wants to win. I got a mayor that God wants to unseat. God wants to undo. God wants to shift the balance of power in our city. And I have jurisdiction over that this morning.”",
                "What Burden said that day in May 2021 was a violation of a long-standing federal law barring churches and nonprofits from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, tax law experts told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. Although the provision was mostly uncontroversial for decades after it passed in 1954, it has become a target for both evangelical churches and former President Donald Trump, who vowed to eliminate it.",
                "Burden’s sermon is among those at 18 churches identified by the news organizations over the past two years that appeared to violate the Johnson Amendment, a measure named after its author, former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Some pastors have gone so far as to paint candidates they oppose as demonic.",
                "At one point, churches fretted over losing their tax-exempt status for even unintentional missteps. But the IRS has largely abdicated its enforcement responsibilities as churches have become more brazen. In fact, the number of apparent violations found by ProPublica and the Tribune, and confirmed by three nonprofit tax law experts, are greater than the total number of churches the federal agency has investigated for intervening in political campaigns over the past decade, according to records obtained by the news organizations.",
                "In response to questions, an IRS spokesperson said that the agency “cannot comment on, neither confirm nor deny, investigations in progress, completed in the past nor contemplated.” Asked about enforcement efforts over the past decade, the IRS pointed the news organizations to annual reports that do not contain such information.Neither Burden nor KingdomLife responded to multiple interview requests or to emailed questions.\n                                \n            \n        ",
                "Trump’s opposition to the law banning political activity by nonprofits “has given some politically-minded evangelical leaders a sense that the Johnson Amendment just isn’t really an issue anymore, and that they can go ahead and campaign for or against candidates or positions from the pulpit,” said David Brockman, a scholar in religion and public policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.",
                "Among the violations the newsrooms identified: In January, an Alaska pastor told his congregation that he was voting for a GOP candidate who is aiming to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, saying the challenger was the “only candidate for Senate that can flat-out preach.” During a May 15 sermon, a pastor in Rocklin, California, asked voters to get behind “a Christian conservative candidate” challenging Gov. Gavin Newsom. And in July, a New Mexico pastor called Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham “beyond evil” and “demonic” for supporting abortion access. He urged congregants to “vote her behind right out of office” and challenged the media to call him out for violating the Johnson Amendment.",
                "Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at the University of Indiana-Purdue, who studies Christian nationalism, said the ramping up of political activity by churches could further polarize the country. “It creates hurdles for a healthy, functioning, pluralistic democratic society,” he said. “It’s really hard to overcome.”",
                "The Johnson Amendment does not prohibit churches from inviting political speakers or discussing positions that may seem partisan nor does it restrict voters from making faith-based decisions on who should represent them. But because donations to churches are tax-deductible and because churches don’t have to file financial disclosures with the IRS, without such a rule donors seeking to influence elections could go undetected, said Andrew Seidel, vice president of strategic communications for the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.“If you pair the ability to wade into partisan politics with a total absence of financial oversight and transparency, you’re essentially creating super PACs that are black holes,” Seidel said.",
                "Churches have long balanced the tightrope of political involvement, and blatant violations have previously been rare. In the 1960s, the IRS investigated complaints that some churches abused their tax-exempt status by distributing literature that was hostile to the election of John F. Kennedy, the country’s first Catholic president. And in 2004, the federal agency audited All Saints Episcopal Church in California after a pastor gave an anti-war speech that imagined Jesus talking to presidential candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry. The pastor did not endorse a candidate but criticized the Iraq war.",
                "Some conservative groups have argued that Black churches are more politically active than their white evangelical counterparts but are not as heavily scrutinized. During the 1984 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was accused of turning Sunday sermons into campaign rallies and using Black churches to raise funds. In response to allegations of illegal campaigning, Jackson said at the time that strict guidelines were followed and denied violating the law.",
                "While some Black churches have crossed the line into political endorsements, the long legacy of political activism in these churches stands in sharp contrast to white evangelical churches, where some pastors argue devout Christians must take control of government positions, said Robert Wuthnow, the former director of the Princeton University Center for the Study of Religion.Wuthnow said long-standing voter outreach efforts inside Black churches, such as Souls to the Polls, which encourages voting on Sundays after church services, largely stay within the boundaries of the law.",
                "“The Black church has been so keenly aware of its marginalized position,” Wuthnow said. “The Black church, historically, was the one place where Black people could mobilize, could organize, could feel that they had some power at the local level. The white evangelical church has power. It’s in office. It’s always had power.”At the end of his two-hour sermon that May, Burden asserted that his church had a God-given power to choose lawmakers, and he asked others to join him onstage to “secure the gate over the city.”",
                "Burden and a handful of church members crouched down and held on to a rod, at times speaking in tongues. The pastor said intruders such as the mayor, who was not up for reelection last year but who supported one of the candidates in the race for City Council, would be denied access to the gates of the city.“Now this is bold, but I’m going to say it because I felt it from the Lord. I felt the Lord say, ‘Revoke the mayor’s keys to this gate,’” Burden said. “No more do you have the key to the city. We revoke your key this morning, Mr. Mayor.“We shut you out of the place of power,” Burden added. “The place of authority and influence.”Questions about the political involvement of tax-exempt organizations were swirling when Congress ordered an investigation in April 1952 to determine if some foundations were using their money “for un-American and subversive activities.”",
                "Leading the probe was Rep. Gene Cox, a Georgia Democrat who had accused the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, among others, of helping alleged Communists or Communist fronts. Cox died during the investigation, and the final report cleared the foundations of wrongdoing.",
                "But a Republican member of the committee argued for additional scrutiny, and in July 1953, Congress established the House Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. The committee focused heavily on liberal organizations, but it also investigated nonprofits such as the Facts Forum foundation, which was headed by Texas oilman H.L. Hunt, an ardent supporter of then-Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, a Republican who was best known for holding hearings to investigate suspected Communists.",
                "In July 1954, Johnson, who was then a senator, proposed an amendment to the U.S. tax code that would strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status for “intervening” in political campaigns. The amendment sailed through Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower.",
                "Johnson never explained his intent. Opponents of the amendment, as well as some academics, say Johnson was motivated by a desire to undercut conservative foundations such as the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, founded by newspaper magnate Frank Gannett, which painted the Democrat as soft on communism and supported his opponent in the primary election. Others have hypothesized that Johnson was hoping to head off a wider crackdown on nonprofit foundations.Over the next 40 years, the IRS stripped a handful of religious nonprofits of their tax-exempt status. None were churches.",
                "Then, just four days before the 1992 presidential election, Branch Ministries in New York ran two full-page ads in USA Today and The Washington Times urging voters to reject then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in his challenge to Republican President George H.W. Bush.",
                "The ads proclaimed: “Christian Beware. Do not put the economy ahead of the Ten Commandments.” They asserted that Clinton violated scripture by supporting “abortion on demand,” homosexuality and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in public schools. Clinton, the ads said, was “openly promoting policies that are in rebellion to God’s laws.”The IRS revoked the church’s tax-exempt status, leading to a long legal battle that ended with a U.S. appeals court siding with the federal agency.",
                "The case remains the only publicly known example of the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of a church because of its political activity in nearly 70 years. The Congressional Research Service said in 2012 that a second church had lost its tax-exempt status, but that its identity “is not clear.”Citing an increase in allegations of church political activity leading up to the 2004 presidential election between incumbent Bush and Kerry, IRS officials created the Political Activities Compliance Initiative to fast-track investigations.",
                "Over the next four years, the committee investigated scores of churches, including 80 for endorsing candidates from the pulpit, according to IRS reports. But it did not revoke the tax-exempt status of any. Instead, the IRS mostly sent warning letters that agency officials said were effective in dissuading churches from continuing their political activity, asserting that there were no repeat offenders in that period.In some cases, the IRS initiated audits of churches that could have led to financial penalties. It’s unclear how many did.In January 2009, a federal court dismissed an audit into alleged financial improprieties at a Minnesota church whose pastor had supported the congressional campaign of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota.",
                "The court found that the IRS had not been following its own rules for a decade because it was tasked with notifying churches of their legal rights before any pending audits and was required to have an appropriately high-level official sign off on them. But a 1998 agency reorganization had eliminated the position, leaving lower IRS employees to initiate church investigations.Following the ruling, the IRS suspended its investigations into church political activity for five years, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report.",
                "During the hiatus, a conservative Christian initiative called Pulpit Freedom Sunday flourished. Pastors recorded themselves endorsing candidates or giving political sermons that they believed violated the Johnson Amendment and sent them to the IRS. The goal, according to participants, was to trigger a lawsuit that would lead to the prohibition being ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.The IRS never challenged participating churches, and the effort wound down without achieving its aim.",
                "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from ProPublica and the Tribune last year, the IRS produced a severely redacted spreadsheet indicating the agency had launched inquiries into 16 churches since 2011. IRS officials shielded the results of the probes, and they have declined to answer specific questions.Despite the agency’s limited enforcement, Trump promised shortly after he took office that he would “totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.”",
                "As president, Trump tried unsuccessfully to remove the restrictions on church politicking through a 2017 executive order. The move was largely symbolic because it simply ordered the government not to punish churches differently than it would any other nonprofit, according to a legal filing by the Justice Department.Eliminating the Johnson Amendment would require congressional or judicial action.Although the IRS has not discussed its plans, it has taken procedural steps that would enable it to ramp up audits again if it chooses to.",
                "In 2019, more than two decades after eliminating the high-level position needed to sign off on action against churches, the IRS designated the commissioner of the agency’s tax-exempt and government entities division as the “appropriate high-level Treasury official” with the power to initiate a church audit.But Philip Hackney, a former IRS attorney and University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, said he doesn’t read too much into that. “I don’t see any reason to believe that the operation of the IRS has changed significantly.”",
                "There is no uniform way to monitor church sermons across the country. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, many churches now post their services online, and ProPublica and the Tribune reviewed dozens of them. Many readers shared sermons with us. (You can do so here.)Texas’ large evangelical population and history of activism in Black churches makes the state a focal point for debates over political activity, said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.",
                "“Combine all of that with the increasing competitiveness of Texas elections, and it’s no surprise that more and more Texas churches are taking on a political role,” he said. “Texas is a perfect arena for widespread, religiously motivated political activism.”",
                "The state also has a long history of politically minded pastors, Wuthnow said. Texas evangelical church leaders joined the fight in support of alcohol prohibition a century ago and spearheaded efforts to defeat Democrat Al Smith, the first Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party, in 1928. In the 1940s, evangelical fundamentalism began to grow in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.",
                "Today, North Texas remains home to influential pastors such as Robert Jeffress, who leads the First Baptist megachurch in Dallas. Jeffress was one of Trump’s most fervent supporters, appearing at campaign events, defending him on television news shows and stating that he “absolutely” did not regret supporting the former president after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.",
                "Burden went a step further, urging followers to stock up on food and keep their guns loaded ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. He told parishioners that “prophetic voices” had told him in 2016 that Trump would have eight consecutive years in office.The Frisco Conservative Coalition board voted to suspend Burden as chair for 30 days after criticism about his remarks.Burden called his comments “inartful” but claimed he was unfairly targeted for his views. “The establishment media is coming after me,” he said at the time. “But it is not just about me. People of faith are under attack in this country.”Since then, Burden has repeatedly preached that the church has been designated by the Lord to decide who should serve in public office and “take dominion” over Frisco.",
                "As the runoff for the Frisco City Council approached last year, Burden supported Jennifer White, a local veterinarian. White had positioned herself as the conservative candidate in the nonpartisan race against Angelia Pelham, a Black human resources executive who had the backing of the Frisco mayor.",
                "White said she wasn’t in attendance during the May 2021 sermon in which Burden called her the “candidate that God wants to win.” She said she does not believe pastors should endorse candidates from the pulpit, but she welcomed churches becoming more politically active.",
                "“I think that the churches over the years have been a big pretty big disappointment to the candidates in that they won't take a political stance,” White said in an interview. “So I would love it if churches would go ahead and come out and actually discuss things like morality. Not a specific party, but at least make sure people know where the candidates stand on those issues. And how to vote based on that.”Pelham’s husband, local pastor Dono Pelham, also made a statement that violated the Johnson Amendment by “indirectly intervening” in the campaign, said Ellen Aprill, an emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles",
                "In May 2021, Pelham told his church that the race for a seat on the City Council had resulted in a runoff. He acknowledged that his church’s tax-exempt status prevented him from supporting candidates from the pulpit. Then, he added, “but you’ll get the message.”“It’s been declared for the two candidates who received the most votes, one of which is my wife,” Pelham said. “That’s just facts. That’s just facts. That’s just facts. And so a runoff is coming and every vote counts. Be sure to vote.”Pelham then asked the congregation: “How did I do? I did all right, didn’t I? You know I wanted to go a little further, but I didn’t do it.”Angelia Pelham, who co-founded Life-Changing Faith Christian Fellowship in 2008 with her husband, said the couple tried to avoid violating the Johnson Amendment. Both disagreed that her husband’s mention of her candidacy was a violation.",
                "“I think church and state should remain separate,” Angelia Pelham said in an interview, adding: “But I think there’s a lot of folks in the religious setting that just completely didn’t even consider the line. They erased it completely and lost sight of the Johnson Amendment.”She declined to discuss Burden’s endorsement of her opponent.In his sermon the morning after Pelham defeated his chosen candidate, Burden told parishioners that the church’s political involvement would continue.“So you’re like, but you lost last night? No, we set the stage for the future,” he said, adding “God is uncovering the demonic structure that is in this region.”Most Americans don’t want pastors making endorsements from the pulpit, according to a 2017 survey by the Program for Public Consultation, which is part of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland.Of the nearly 2,500 registered voters who were surveyed, 79% opposed getting rid of the Johnson Amendment. Only among Republican evangelical voters did a slight majority — 52% — favor loosening restrictions on church political activity.But such endorsements are taking place across the country, with some pastors calling for a debate about the Johnson Amendment.After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, New Mexico became an island of abortion access for women in Texas and other neighboring states.The issue raised the stakes in the upcoming Nov. 8 New Mexico governor’s race between incumbent Lujan Grisham, a supporter of abortion rights, and Republican challenger Mark Ronchetti, who advocates limiting access.",
                "“We’re going to fast become the No. 1 abortion place in all of America,” a pastor, Steve Smothermon, said during a July 10 sermon at Legacy Church in Albuquerque, which has an average weekly attendance of more than 10,000 people. Smotherman said the governor was “wicked and evil” and called her “a narcissist.”“And people think, ‘Why do you say that?’ Because I truly believe it. In fact, she’s beyond evil. It’s demonic,” Smothermon said.He later added: “Folks, when are we going to get appalled? When are we going to say, ‘Enough is enough’? When are we going to stop saying, ‘Well, you know, it’s a woman’s right to choose’? That’s such a lie.”Church attendees had a stark choice in the upcoming election, Smothermon said. “We have the Wicked Witch of the North. Or you have Mark Ronchetti.”The governor’s campaign declined to comment. Neither Legacy Church, Smothermon nor Ronchetti responded to requests for comment.\n                                \n            \n        The sermon was a “clear violation” of the Johnson Amendment, said Sam Brunson, a Loyola University Chicago law professor. But Smothermon showed no fear of IRS enforcement.Those who thought he crossed the line were “so stupid,” Smothermon said during the sermon. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”In another example, pastors at a Fort Worth church named Mercy Culture have repeatedly endorsed candidates for local and statewide offices since its founding in 2019.",
                "“Now, obviously, churches don’t endorse candidates, but my name is Landon and I’m a person before I’m a pastor. And as an individual, I endorse Nate Schatzline,” the lead pastor, Landon Schott, said in a February sermon about a church member who was running to fill an open state representative seat.Johnson Amendment rules allow pastors to endorse in their individual capacity, as long as they are not at an official church function, which Schott was.In other services, Schott challenged critics to complain to the IRS about the church’s support of political candidates and said he wasn’t worried about losing the church’s tax-exempt status.“If you want it that bad, come and take it. And if you think that we will stop preaching the gospel, speaking truth over taxes, you got another thing coming for you,” Schott said in May.",
                "Schatzline, a member of Mercy Culture, received 65% of the vote in a May 24 runoff against the former mayor of the Dallas suburb of Southlake. He works for a separate nonprofit founded by Heather Schott, a pastor at Mercy Culture and the wife of Landon Schott.Schatzline said in an interview with ProPublica and the Tribune that Landon Schott, not the church, endorsed him. He added that the church sought legal advice on how to ensure that it was complying with the Johnson Amendment.“I think prayers can manifest into anything that God wants them to, but I would say that the community rallying behind me as individuals definitely manifested into votes,” Schatzline said.",
                "Mercy Culture also supported Tim O’Hare, a Republican running for Tarrant County judge, this year after he came out against the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. His opponent in the primary had ordered churches and businesses to temporarily close when she was mayor of Fort Worth.",
                "O’Hare came to prominence as the mayor of suburban Farmers Branch, where he championed a city ordinance to prohibit landlords from renting to immigrants without legal status. A federal court declared the ordinance unconstitutional in 2010 after a legal battle that cost the city $6.6 million.O’Hare has pledged to hire an election integrity officer to oversee voting and “uncover election fraud.”",
                "“The Lord spoke to me and said, ‘Begin to pray for righteous judges in our city,’” Heather Schott said during a Feb. 13 service. “I am believing that Mr. Tim O’Hare is an answered prayer of what we have been petitioning heaven for for the last year and a half.”Neither Mercy Culture, Landon Schott nor Heather Schott responded to requests for comment. O’Hare also did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.Schott’s comments were a prohibited endorsement, said Aprill, the emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles.“It doesn’t say ‘vote for him’ but is still an endorsement,” she said. “There’s no other way to understand the statement that O’Hare has answered prayers for righteous judges.”Two weeks later, O’Hare won his primary. He faces Deborah Peoples, a Democrat, on Nov. 8.",
                "On April 18, 2021, a day before early voting began for city council and school board elections across Texas, pastors at churches just miles apart flashed the names of candidates on overhead screens. They told their congregations that local church leaders had gathered to discuss upcoming city and school elections and realized that their members were among those seeking office.",
                "“We’re not endorsing a candidate. We’re not doing that. But we just thought because they’re a member of the family of God, that you might want to know if someone in the family and this family of churches is running,” said Robert Morris, who leads the Gateway megachurch in Southlake and served as a member of Trump’s evangelical advisory board.On the same day, Doug Page gave a similar message less than 5 miles away at First Baptist Grapevine.",
                "“And so what we decided to do is look within our church families and say, ‘Who do we know that’s running for office?’ Now, let me clarify with you. This is not an endorsement by us. We are not endorsing anyone. However, if you’re part of a family, you’d like to know if Uncle Bill is running for office, right? And so that’s all we’re going to do is simply inform you.”Saying that you are not endorsing a candidate “isn’t like a magic silver bullet that makes it so that you’re not endorsing them,” Brunson said.\n                                \n            \n        The churches’ coordination on messaging across the area is notable, according to University of Notre Dame tax law professor Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, who said he hadn’t before seen churches organizing to share lists of candidates.“I do think this strategy is new,” said Mayer, who has studied the Johnson Amendment for more than a decade. “I hadn’t heard of that before. It’s quite a sophisticated tactic.”Eight of the nine candidates mentioned by the pastors won their races.",
                "Mindy McClure, who ran for reelection to the Grapevine-Colleyville school board, said she thought church involvement contributed to her defeat in a June 5, 2021, runoff by about 4 percentage points. Her opponent campaigned on removing critical race theory from district curriculum, while McClure said students “weren’t being indoctrinated in any way, shape or form.” Critical race theory is a college-level academic theory that racism is embedded in legal systems.McClure said pastors endorsing from the pulpit creates “divisiveness” in the community.“Just because you attend a different church doesn’t mean that you’re more connected with God,” she said.",
                "Lawrence Swicegood, executive director of Gateway Media, said this month that the church doesn’t endorse candidates but “inform(s) our church family of other church family members who are seeking office to serve our community.” Page told ProPublica and the Tribune that “these candidates were named for information only.”",
                "Eleven days after responding to ProPublica and the Tribune in October, Morris once again told his church that he was not endorsing any candidates during the last Sunday sermon before early voting.

                "There was “a historically high level of both far-right and far-left terrorist attacks in 2021,” the bipartisan think tank’s researchers said, adding that “violent far-right incidents were significantly more likely to be lethal, both in terms of weapon choice and number of resulting fatalities.”Robert Pape, a University of Chicago<g><g> political </g></g>scientist, likened the nation to a landscape full of flammable hazards during wildfire season.“That combustible material doesn’t go off spontaneously — you need a lightning strike or cigar butt to trigger it,” Pape said.“We are a tinderbox right now. ... The difference between the right and the left is you are getting lightning strikes on the right,” he continued. “It is just happening again and again.”The “lightning strikes,” Pape said, are messages, explicit or implied, from prominent Republican politicians or media figures who use incendiary rhetoric and winking nods to conspiracy theories to stoke animosity<g> against </g>their ideological opponents.",
                "Animus<g> against </g>Republicans has also led to danger and bloodshed. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the third-ranking House Republican, was gravely wounded in 2017 when a gunman opened fire at a practice for the GOP’s congressional baseball team. And in June, a California man armed with a pistol, a knife and tactical gear was arrested outside conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett M.

                "Though some Democrats have been criticized for provocative language — Senate Majority Leader Charles E.

Political<g> violence </g>is an endemic feature of American<g> political </g>history. It was foundational to the overthrow of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the maintenance of Jim Crow for decades after.But today’s events bear uncanny resemblance to an earlier decade — the 1850s, when Southern Democrats, the conservatives of their day, unleashed a torrent of<g> violence </g>against their opponents. It was a decade when an angry and entrenched minority used<g> force </g>to thwart the<g><g><g> will </g></g></g>of a growing majority, often with the knowing support and<g> even </g>participation of prominent elected officials.That’s the familiar part of the story. The less appreciated angle is how that growing majority eventually came to accept the proposition that<g> force </g>was a<g> necessary </g>part of politics.<b>The<g> 1850s </g>were a singularly violent era </b>in American politics. Though politicians both North and South, Whig and Democrat, tried to contain sectional differences over slavery, Southern Democrats and their Northern sympathizers increasingly pushed the envelope, employing coercion and<g> violence </g>to<g> protect </g>and spread the institution of slavery.",
                " It began with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which stripped accused runaways of their right to trial by jury and allowed individual cases to be bumped up from<g> state </g>courts to special federal courts. As an extra incentive to federal commissioners adjudicating such cases, it provided a $10 fee when a defendant was remanded to<g><g> slavery </g></g>but only $5 for a finding rendered against the slave owner. Most obnoxious to many Northerners, the law stipulated harsh fines and prison sentences for any citizen who refused to cooperate with or aid federal authorities in the capture of accused fugitives. Southern Democrats enforced the law with brute force, to the horror of Northerners, including many who did not identify as anti-slavery.",
                "The next provocation was the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854, which effectively abrogated the Missouri Compromise and opened the western territories to slavery. It wasn’t enough that Democrats rammed through legislation allowing the citizens of the Kansas and Nebraska territories to institutionalize<g><g> slavery </g></g>if they voted to do so in what had long been considered<g><g> free </g></g>territory. They then employed coercion and<g> violence </g>to rig the territorial elections that followed.",
                "Though anti-slavery<g><g> residents </g></g>far<g> outnumbered </g>pro-slavery<g><g> residents </g></g>in Kansas,<g> heavily </g>armed “Border ruffians,”<g> led </g>by Missouri’s Democratic<g> senator </g>David Atchison,<g> stormed </g>the Kansas<g> territory </g>by force,<g> stuffing </g>ballot boxes,<g> assaulting </g>and<g> even </g>killing Free State settlers, in a<g> naked </g>attempt to<g> tilt </g>the<g> scales </g>in<g> favor </g>of slavery. “You<g> know </g>how to<g> protect </g>your<g> own </g>interests,” Atchison cried. “Your rifles<g><g><g> will </g></g></g>free you from such neighbors. … You<g><g><g> will </g></g></g>go there, if necessary, with the<g> bayonet </g>and with blood.” He promised, “If we win, we can carry<g><g> slavery </g></g>to the Pacific Ocean.”",
                "The<g> violence </g>made it into Congress. When backlash against the Kansas Nebraska Act upended the<g> political </g>balance, driving anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs into the new, anti-slavery Republican party, pro-slavery Democrats responded with rage. In 1856, Charles Sumner, a staunch anti-slavery Republican, delivered a speech entitled “The Crime Against Kansas.” In response, a Democratic congressman from South Carolina beat him nearly to death on the Senate floor with a steel-tipped cane — not entirely dissimilar from the hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist who attempted to murder Paul Pelosi Friday.“Bleeding Sumner,” as the outrage came to be known, was not a one-off. Pro-slavery congressmen began showing up<g> armed </g>on the House floor. They threatened their Northern colleagues with whippings and beatings. They talked openly of civil war and rebellion.<b>In some ways, none of this was new.</b> Pro-slavery forces had long been violent and anti-democratic. When abolitionists in the 1830s began sending anti-slavery literature to Southern slaveholders, the pro-slavery forces tried to ban them from using the postal service. They destroyed the printing presses of abolitionist publishers and, in 1837, famously lynched Elijah P. Lovejoy, an abolitionist clergyman — after dumping his press in the river.But the<g> 1850s </g>were different — not just in the intensification of pro-slavery violence, but in the reaction it elicited.Southerners had long assumed that their Northern antagonists would buckle and fold. Anti-slavery men and women tended to draw their faith from evangelical Protestantism, which favored moral suasion over coercion. They were pacifists by nature. They seemed unlikely, when faced with threat and violence, to fight back.That was probably true in 1850. But by mid-decade, something changed.",
                "It probably began with the Fugitive Slave Act, which inspired resistance — increasingly, violent resistance — on the part of Northerners. When in 1852 President Franklin Pierce sent a battery of Army and Navy servicemen to seize Anthony Burns, a fugitive who had escaped to Boston, many former moderates found became angry, and radicalized. Amos Lawrence, a conservative businessman and politician, later attested, “We went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs &amp; waked up stark mad Abolitionists.”",
                "Armed anti-slavery mobs increasingly proved willing to engage in standoffs with federal officials. Outside Christiana, Pennsylvania, a Maryland slaveowner and his son, accompanied by<g> armed </g>marshals, showed up at a farmhouse and imperiously demanded the return of a Black man whom they claimed was their runaway slave.

                "Something changed in the tenor of anti-slavery rhetoric as well. Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person and lay preacher, declared that he was a “peace man,” but white men who willingly acted as “bloodhounds,” hunting down human beings to return them to slavery, had “no right to live.” “I do believe that two or three dead slaveholders<g><g><g> will </g></g></g>make this law a dead letter.” In a speech entitled “Is It Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?” Douglass conceded that perhaps it was not strategically smart, given the disbalance of power, but he affirmed that it “is in all cases, a crime to deprive a human being of life” and not a sin to kill those who would. “For a white man to defend his friend unto<g> blood </g>is praiseworthy,” Douglass wrote in 1854, “but for a Black man to do the same thing is crime. It was glorious for Patrick Henry to say, ‘Give me liberty or give me death!’ It was glorious for Americans to drench the soil, and crimson the sea with blood, to escape the payment of three-penny tax upon tea; but it is a crime to shoot down a monster in defense of the liberty of a Black man and to save him from bondage.”His was a minority opinion in the mid-1850s, but it was catching steam.",
                "A new generation of leaders welcomed an eye-for-an-eye approach to keeping the western territories free. Subsidized by a group of Massachusetts businessmen and religious abolitionists, the New England Emigrant Aid Company offered material assistance to Northern homesteaders willing to relocate to Kansas to populate the<g> state </g>with an anti-slavery majority. It also furnished them with<g> rifles </g>(known popularly as “Beecher’s Bibles,” an homage to Henry Ward Beecher, the prominent anti-slavery clergyman) and ammunition to help<g> settlers </g>stave off attacks by<g> border </g>ruffians who pillaged Free State property and rigged territorial elections. By 1857 the normalization of<g> political </g>violence advanced so<g> far </g>that when a prominent abolitionist urged the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to furnish material support for<g> armed </g>insurrections by enslaved people,<g> even </g>Wendell Phillips, a leading abolitionist and heretofore a pacifist, rose to agree. “I want to accustom Massachusetts to the idea of insurrection,” he said, “to the idea that every slave has the right to seize his freedom on the spot.”",
                "It was this embrace of retributive justice and support for violent liberation that<g> led </g>figures like Thomas Wentworth Higginson (a Unitarian minister), Gerrit Smith (a wealthy reformer and founder of a nonsectarian church in upstate New York), Theodore Parker (also a Unitarian clergyman), and Frederick Douglass to furnish John Brown with funds for his failed<g> attempt </g>to organize an uprising of enslaved people. Brown, a religious zealot who came to believe that he was God’s instrument in the service of emancipation, was widely scorned as a fanatic when in 1859 he was hanged for murder, incitement of an enslaved people’s rebellion, and “treason” against the<g> state </g>of Virginia. Within a few short years, many Union soldiers would come to memorialize him in song as they marched through the South.Members of Congress, too, tired of being under the Southern Democrats’ boot. When Galusha Grow, a Republican from Pennsylvania, wandered over to the Democratic side of the House floor in 1858, Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina snarled, “Go back to your side of the House, you Black Republican puppy.” Grow, a future House speaker, clocked Keitt with a right hook and sent him spinning.",
                " In 1860 Rep. Owen Lovejoy, a Republican from Illinois and brother of the slain editor, rose to deliver a blistering anti-slavery harangue. In response, Rep. Roger Pryor of Virginia physically assaulted him, prompting Rep. John Potter of Wisconsin to intercede. Potter so thoroughly walloped Pryor that the Virginian felt compelled to challenge him to a duel — a common ploy, as Northerners tended to view dueling as barbaric, and normally declined. Potter astonished his Southern colleague by accepting the challenge and stipulating (as was the right of the challenged party) bowie knives as his weapon of choice. Pryor, recognizing that he’d likely be hacked to death, backed out, claiming that knives were beneath the dignity of a gentleman’s duel. (Potter might well have taken his cue from Benjamin Wade, a radical Republican<g> senator </g>from Ohio who, when challenged to a duel by a Southern colleague, stipulated squirrel riffles at 20 paces.)Within a year, full-blown war had broken out.",

Members of Congress threatening to bring guns onto the House floor — or actually trying to do it. Prominent Republican members of Congress, and their supporters on Fox News, stoking violence against their political opponents by accusing them of being pedophiles, terrorists and groomers — of conspiring with “globalists” (read: Jews) to “replace” white people with immigrants.And of course, January 6, and subsequent efforts by Republicans and conservative media personalities to whitewash or even celebrate it.Pundits like to take refuge in the saccharine refrain, “this is not who we are,” but historically, this is exactly who we are. Political violence is an endemic feature of American political history. It was foundational to the overthrow of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the maintenance of Jim Crow for decades after.But today’s events bear uncanny resemblance to an earlier decade — the 1850s, when Southern Democrats, the conservatives of their day, unleashed a torrent of violence against their opponents. It was a decade when an angry and entrenched minority used force to thwart the will of a growing majority, often with the knowing support and even participation of prominent elected officials.That’s the familiar part of the story. The less appreciated angle is how that growing majority eventually came to accept the proposition that force was a necessary part of politics.The 1850s were a singularly violent era in American politics. Though politicians both North and South, Whig and Democrat, tried to contain sectional differences over slavery, Southern Democrats and their Northern sympathizers increasingly pushed the envelope, employing coercion and violence to protect and spread the institution of slavery.",

It wasn’t enough that Democrats rammed through legislation allowing the citizens of the Kansas and Nebraska territories to institutionalize slavery if they voted to do so in what had long been considered free territory. They then employed coercion and violence to rig the territorial elections that followed.",
                "Though anti-slavery residents far outnumbered pro-slavery residents in Kansas, heavily armed “Border ruffians,” led by Missouri’s Democratic senator David Atchison, stormed the Kansas territory by force, stuffing ballot boxes, assaulting and even killing Free State settlers, in a naked attempt to tilt the scales in favor of slavery. “You know how to protect your own interests,” Atchison cried. “Your rifles will free you from such neighbors. … You will go there, if necessary, with the bayonet and with blood.” He promised, “If we win, we can carry slavery to the Pacific Ocean.”",
                "The violence made it into Congress. When backlash against the Kansas Nebraska Act upended the political balance, driving anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs into the new, anti-slavery Republican party, pro-slavery Democrats responded with rage. In 1856, Charles Sumner, a staunch anti-slavery Republican, delivered a speech entitled “The Crime Against Kansas.” In response, a Democratic congressman from South Carolina beat him nearly to death on the Senate floor with a steel-tipped cane — not entirely dissimilar from the hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist who attempted to murder Paul Pelosi Friday.“Bleeding Sumner,” as the outrage came to be known, was not a one-off. Pro-slavery congressmen began showing up armed on the House floor. They threatened their Northern colleagues with whippings and beatings. They talked openly of civil war and rebellion.In some ways, none of this was new. Pro-slavery forces had long been violent and anti-democratic. When abolitionists in the 1830s began sending anti-slavery literature to Southern slaveholders, the pro-slavery forces tried to ban them from using the postal service. They destroyed the printing presses of abolitionist publishers and, in 1837, famously lynched Elijah P. Lovejoy, an abolitionist clergyman — after dumping his press in the river.But the 1850s were different — not just in the intensification of pro-slavery violence, but in the reaction it elicited.Southerners had long assumed that their Northern antagonists would buckle and fold. Anti-slavery men and women tended to draw their faith from evangelical Protestantism, which favored moral suasion over coercion. They were pacifists by nature. They seemed unlikely, when faced with threat and violence, to fight back.That was probably true in 1850. But by mid-decade, something changed.",
                "It probably began with the Fugitive Slave Act, which inspired resistance — increasingly, violent resistance — on the part of Northerners. When in 1852 President Franklin Pierce sent a battery of Army and Navy servicemen to seize Anthony Burns, a fugitive who had escaped to Boston, many former moderates found became angry, and radicalized. Amos Lawrence, a conservative businessman and politician, later attested, “We went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs & waked up stark mad Abolitionists.”",
                "Armed anti-slavery mobs increasingly proved willing to engage in standoffs with federal officials. Outside Christiana, Pennsylvania, a Maryland slaveowner and his son, accompanied by armed marshals, showed up at a farmhouse and imperiously demanded the return of a Black man whom they claimed was their runaway slave. Local residents, Black and white alike, engaged in a gun fight with the “man stealers,” leaving one of them dead and two others wounded.",
                "Something changed in the tenor of anti-slavery rhetoric as well. Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person and lay preacher, declared that he was a “peace man,” but white men who willingly acted as “bloodhounds,” hunting down human beings to return them to slavery, had “no right to live.” “I do believe that two or three dead slaveholders will make this law a dead letter.” In a speech entitled “Is It Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?” Douglass conceded that perhaps it was not strategically smart, given the disbalance of power, but he affirmed that it “is in all cases, a crime to deprive a human being of life” and not a sin to kill those who would. “For a white man to defend his friend unto blood is praiseworthy,” Douglass wrote in 1854, “but for a Black man to do the same thing is crime. It was glorious for Patrick Henry to say, ‘Give me liberty or give me death!’ It was glorious for Americans to drench the soil, and crimson the sea with blood, to escape the payment of three-penny tax upon tea; but it is a crime to shoot down a monster in defense of the liberty of a Black man and to save him from bondage.”His was a minority opinion in the mid-1850s, but it was catching steam.",

Subsidized by a group of Massachusetts businessmen and religious abolitionists, the New England Emigrant Aid Company offered material assistance to Northern homesteaders willing to relocate to Kansas to populate the state with an anti-slavery majority. It also furnished them with rifles (known popularly as “Beecher’s Bibles,” an homage to Henry Ward Beecher, the prominent anti-slavery clergyman) and ammunition to help settlers stave off attacks by border ruffians who pillaged Free State property and rigged territorial elections. By 1857 the normalization of political violence advanced so far that when a prominent abolitionist urged the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to furnish material support for armed insurrections by enslaved people, even Wendell Phillips, a leading abolitionist and heretofore a pacifist, rose to agree. “I want to accustom Massachusetts to the idea of insurrection,” he said, “to the idea that every slave has the right to seize his freedom on the spot.”",
                "It was this embrace of retributive justice and support for violent liberation that led figures like Thomas Wentworth Higginson (a Unitarian minister), Gerrit Smith (a wealthy reformer and founder of a nonsectarian church in upstate New York), Theodore Parker (also a Unitarian clergyman), and Frederick Douglass to furnish John Brown with funds for his failed attempt to organize an uprising of enslaved people. Brown, a religious zealot who came to believe that he was God’s instrument in the service of emancipation, was widely scorned as a fanatic when in 1859 he was hanged for murder, incitement of an enslaved people’s rebellion, and “treason” against the state of Virginia. Within a few short years, many Union soldiers would come to memorialize him in song as they marched through the South.Members of Congress, too, tired of being under the Southern Democrats’ boot. When Galusha Grow, a Republican from Pennsylvania, wandered over to the Democratic side of the House floor in 1858, Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina snarled, “Go back to your side of the House, you Black Republican puppy.” Grow, a future House speaker, clocked Keitt with a right hook and sent him spinning.",
                " In 1860 Rep. Owen Lovejoy, a Republican from Illinois and brother of the slain editor, rose to deliver a blistering anti-slavery harangue. In response, Rep. Roger Pryor of Virginia physically assaulted him, prompting Rep. John Potter of Wisconsin to intercede. Potter so thoroughly walloped Pryor that the Virginian felt compelled to challenge him to a duel — a common ploy, as Northerners tended to view dueling as barbaric, and normally declined. Potter astonished his Southern colleague by accepting the challenge and stipulating (as was the right of the challenged party) bowie knives as his weapon of choice. Pryor, recognizing that he’d likely be hacked to death, backed out, claiming that knives were beneath the dignity of a gentleman’s duel. (Potter might well have taken his cue from Benjamin Wade, a radical Republican senator from Ohio who, when challenged to a duel by a Southern colleague, stipulated squirrel riffles at 20 paces.)Within a year, full-blown war had broken out.",
                "Today, political violence is on the rise. It doesn’t always emanate from the right. Several years ago, a left-wing radical attempted to gun down several Republican congressmen and nearly succeeded in killing GOP Whip Steve Scalise. But in the main, the coercion and bellicosity reside on the right. We see it in the rise of far-right, white power militias like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who in some cases enjoy semiformal relationships with local Republican Party organizations and leaders. We see it in MAGA rallies, where former President Donald Trump regularly incites violence against journalists and political opponents, oftentimes with GOP officeholders and candidates standing silently beside him. We see it in the growing number of political ads in which Republican candidates brandish assault weapons and even shoot things up.",
                "On some level, none of this is new. The United States has seen more than its share of political violence — from Redemption (the process by which white Southerners violently ended Reconstruction in the South) and Jim Crow, to presidential assassinations in 1865, 1881, 1901 and 1963. As recently as the early 1970s, bombings and sabotage were a common tool of far-left domestic terrorists. All told, between January 1969 and April 1970 there were over 5,000 terrorist bombings in the United States and 37,000 bomb threats, many emanating from the radical left, not including the attempted bombings of over two dozen high schools.",
                "But here is the difference this time: In 1970, liberal members of the Senate didn’t march alongside members of the Weather Underground, pump their fists in the air and egg them on. They didn’t align themselves with violent extremists — court their votes, grant interviews to their underground newspapers, appear at their conferences. That’s the stuff of the 1850s, when mainstream Democrats turned away from democracy and openly embraced violence, vigilantism and treason to protect a world they saw at risk of disappearing.The decision of so many American conservatives to embrace political violence, or the language and symbolism of political violence, is a troubling reality. We can’t have a functioning democracy if one side refuses to accept its norms and rules.But history suggests we might have more to worry about.Democratic violence in the 1850s ultimately led a majority of Republicans, who represented the political majority, to draw a line in the sand and enforce it by violence when necessary. If history is a guidepost, we are on the precipice of dangerous future in which politics devolves into a contest of force rather than ideas. That’s a future everyone should want to avoid."

                "Right now, despite the reality that 55 percent of seniors are trying to survive on less than $25,000 a year, leading Republicans in the House and Senate are proposing to cut Social Security benefits, raise the retirement age to 70 or reduce cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for seniors by adopting a less generous formula.&nbsp;Most Democrats believe that we must<g> expand </g>Social Security benefits so that everyone in America can retire with dignity.&nbsp;Not a single Republican in Washington agrees.<strong>Prescription Drugs</strong>",
                "The United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.&nbsp;I believe, and many Democrats believe, that we<g> need </g>to cut the price of prescription drugs in half by requiring Medicare to pay no more than the Veterans Administration does.&nbsp;Not a single Republican in Washington is prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs.&nbsp;Almost every Republican in Washington voted against capping the price of insulin at no more than $35 a month.&nbsp;<strong>Expanding Medicare</strong>",
                "Today, millions of seniors are unable to afford the outrageous cost of dental care, hearing aids or prescription eyeglasses.&nbsp;Most Democrats believe we<g> need </g>to<g> expand </g>Medicare to cover these essential health care services.&nbsp;Not a single Republican member of Congress agrees.&nbsp; Further there are many Republicans in the House and the Senate who support massive cuts to Medicare.<strong>Universal Health Care</strong>",

                "We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of virtually every major country on earth.&nbsp;Most Democrats believe that we should cut the child poverty rate in America by more than 40 percent by extending the $300 a month per child tax credit to<g> working </g>class<g> families </g>that expired last December.&nbsp;Not a single Republican in Washington agrees.<strong>Unions</strong>",

                "At a time when inflation is a worldwide phenomenon (European Union- 10.1 percent, Germany-10 percent, UK-9.7 percent, Canada-7%, etc.), corporations are using the war in Ukraine, the supply chain crisis and the ongoing pandemic to jack up the price of gas, food, and just about everything the American people need.

                "During the pandemic, while the billionaire class saw a $2 trillion increase in their wealth some of the largest corporations and wealthiest people in America did not pay a nickel in federal income taxes.&nbsp;Democrats voted to end that absurdity and begin the process of moving to a fairer tax system.&nbsp;Not one Republican voted to support that effort.&nbsp;In fact, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, Republicans have proposed trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the most profitable corporations and wealthiest people in America.",

                "As corporate profits soar, and as billionaires become even richer, working class Americans are falling further behind. This, sadly, is not a new reality. Tragically, despite huge increases in worker productivity, real inflation adjusted wages for American workers are lower today than they were nearly 50 years ago. During that period there has been a multi-trillion dollar redistribution of wealth that has gone from the middle class to the top 1 percent, and we now have more income and wealth inequality than at any time in American history.  Unbelievably, CEOs of major corporations now make almost 400 times what their average workers make.",
                "Given the economic pain facing working families, many voters are asking themselves which party will better fight for legislation that will improve life for ordinary Americans. As the longest serving Independent in the history of Congress, someone who caucuses with Senate Democrats, let me give you my best answer.",
                "First, let me admit that the Democratic Party is far from perfect. Too many Democratic members of Congress have been unwilling to stand up to the big money interests that dominate Washington and fight for working families. That’s why we need at least 52 Democrats in the Senate.   But here is the simple reality: the Republicans in Congress are far worse when it comes to addressing the needs of the working class.Let me give you some examples.Social Security",
                "Right now, despite the reality that 55 percent of seniors are trying to survive on less than $25,000 a year, leading Republicans in the House and Senate are proposing to cut Social Security benefits, raise the retirement age to 70 or reduce cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for seniors by adopting a less generous formula. Most Democrats believe that we must expand Social Security benefits so that everyone in America can retire with dignity. Not a single Republican in Washington agrees.Prescription Drugs",
                "The United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. I believe, and many Democrats believe, that we need to cut the price of prescription drugs in half by requiring Medicare to pay no more than the Veterans Administration does. Not a single Republican in Washington is prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs. Almost every Republican in Washington voted against capping the price of insulin at no more than $35 a month. Expanding Medicare",
                "Today, millions of seniors are unable to afford the outrageous cost of dental care, hearing aids or prescription eyeglasses. Most Democrats believe we need to expand Medicare to cover these essential health care services. Not a single Republican member of Congress agrees.  Further there are many Republicans in the House and the Senate who support massive cuts to Medicare.Universal Health Care",
                "At a time when 85 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured, most Democrats believe that the U.S. should do what every other major country does and guarantee health care for all. Not a single Republican in Washington agrees. The last time Republicans controlled the Senate they came within one vote of throwing up to 32 million Americans off of their health insurance by repealing the Affordable Care Act.Minimum Wage",
                "Sixty percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and millions are working for starvation wages. Most Democrats believe that we must increase the federal minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. Not a single Republican in Washington agrees. In fact, many Republicans don’t even believe in the concept of the minimum wage. Child Poverty",
                "We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of virtually every major country on earth. Most Democrats believe that we should cut the child poverty rate in America by more than 40 percent by extending the $300 a month per child tax credit to working class families that expired last December. Not a single Republican in Washington agrees.Unions",
                "Today, over 70 percent of the American people support unions.  Most Democrats believe that if we are going to expand the middle class we must make it easier for workers to join unions and end the heavy-handed corporate tactics that make it hard for workers to unionize.  Not a single Republican in Washington supports legislation to make it easier for workers to join unions. Corporate Greed",
                "At a time when inflation is a worldwide phenomenon (European Union- 10.1 percent, Germany-10 percent, UK-9.7 percent, Canada-7%, etc.), corporations are using the war in Ukraine, the supply chain crisis and the ongoing pandemic to jack up the price of gas, food, and just about everything the American people need. Many Democrats believe that we should enact a windfall profits tax on large, greedy corporations. Not a single Republican in Washington agrees.  A Fair Tax Policy",
                "During the pandemic, while the billionaire class saw a $2 trillion increase in their wealth some of the largest corporations and wealthiest people in America did not pay a nickel in federal income taxes. Democrats voted to end that absurdity and begin the process of moving to a fairer tax system. Not one Republican voted to support that effort. In fact, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, Republicans have proposed trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the most profitable corporations and wealthiest people in America.",
                "In conclusion, let me say that it is no secret that many Americans are discouraged by what’s going on in Washington and are unhappy with both major parties. I got that. The answer, however, is not to make a bad situation worse by supporting candidates who will cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the rich. If we have any chance to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent, we must expand the Democratic majority in Congress and continue to push them to represent the needs of the working class, not the billionaire class.Sanders is chairman of the Budget Committee and chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Primary Health and Retirement Subcommittee."

                "Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel called it “unfair” that Democrats would draw a direct line between her party’s villainizing of Pelosi and the Friday home invasion that left the speaker’s husband hospitalized. And National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomemmer/status/1585300985999949824?s=20&amp;t=OI7D_zMSciVoV87wGhAZqg\" target=\"_blank\" data-tracking=\"mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=\">posted a video last week</a> of himself firing a gun with the hashtag #FirePelosi, deflected a question about whether he should have used a weapon along with the hashtag. Instead, Emmer sought to contrast the media’s treatment of the Pelosi attack with what he argued was a comparable lack of attention to the 2017 politically motivated shooting of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). “I’m sure people like to talk about anything but what the Democrats have done to this country,” Emmer said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” ",
                "The debate over political rhetoric’s role in the Paul Pelosi attack, the perpetrator of which steeped himself in online disinformation about<g> fraud </g>in the<g> 2020 </g>election and other conspiracy theories, dominated the airwaves Sunday. On both<g> sides </g>of the aisle, major players broadly condemned the<g> violence </g>— even as they openly disagreed on the root causes, with some Republicans arguing that Democratic policies played a role.",
                "“You can’t say people saying ‘fire Pelosi’ or ‘take back the House’ is saying ‘go do violence.’ It’s just unfair,” McDaniel said on “Fox News Sunday.” She blamed the Paul Pelosi attack on rising crime that she sought to connect to Nancy Pelosi’s party: “If this weren’t Paul Pelosi, this criminal would probably be out on the street tomorrow ... This is what Democrat policies are bringing.”Pressed in a tense exchange by CBS host Margaret Brennan, Emmer said he disagreed with the idea that his \"#FirePelosi” shooting video may have been suggestive or risky. ",
                "Florida Sen. Rick Scott,<g> chair </g>of the GOP’s Senate<g> campaign </g>arm,<g> separately </g>suggested on CNN that “horrible”<g> violence </g>was in<g> part </g>a<g> result </g>of<g> lower </g>public<g> trust </g>in elections. (Officials on both<g> sides </g>of the aisle,<g> including </g>Trump-era<g> attorney </g>general William Barr, have<g> affirmed </g>that President Joe Biden’s<g> 2020 </g>victory was<g> not </g>affected by<g> widespread </g>voter fraud.)",
                "“Be poll watchers, so you can see that<g> elections </g>are going to be fair,” Scott told voters. He also cited the beating last week of a canvasser for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who did<g> not </g>initially say he believed the attack was political but revised that <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article267893567.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-tracking=\"mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=\">in later reports</a>.

The clincher is that police say DePape broke into the residence hoping that the House speaker, who was out of town, would be present, shouting “Where is Nancy?!”",

For the last 21 months, the voices of those most worried about the precarious state of American democracy have warned that right-wing extremists would try to finish what they started that day. Here now is the most tangible proof yet that violence remains the cutting edge of these growing threats to the American Experiment, in the most advanced assassination plot against a high-ranking official in more than 40 years.Yet 3,000 miles away on the West Side of Manhattan, the editors of the nation’s most influential media outlet, the New York Times, apparently weren’t feeling it. In laying out the next day’s front page of the so-called paper of record, Times journalists did squeeze the attack on Paul Pelosi onto the very bottom right, with a headline — “Pelosi’s Husband Is Badly Injured in a Hammer Attack by an Intruder” — devoid of any political import.Instead, editors of the nation’s most-read legacy newspaper rated Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, with two articles, and developments around the U.S. economy and Britain’s new prime minister, as well as the deaths of rocker Jerry Lee Lewis and Harlem minister Calvin Butts, as more or at least equally important as an assault on our democracy.Veteran Times watchers noted that the wounding of Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise in an assassination attempt by a left-wing loon received large type splashed across the top of Page 1, and they also recalled the fateful day in late October 2016 when the paper gave 80% of the front page to a nothingburger twist over Hillary Clinton’s emails.",

A muddled voice from America’s leading newsrooms won’t help in quashing the inevitable right-wing conspiracy theories about what happened in San Francisco which — you will not be shocked to learn — spread within hours of the news. But the muted response also gave wide license for TV pundits to “both sides” this assassination attempt when almost all of the political violence in America, as well as the threats to our election, are coming from one side, which is the far-right movement driving the Republican Party.",

James Comer, was allowed to opine on CNN, despite the general lack of such rhetoric or violent attacks coming from the left side. Needless to say, the dialogue was even worse on places like Fox News, where the news somehow bled into its long-running memes about street crime in Democratic-run cities like San Francisco.

            "slides": [
                "MIAMI — Mauricio Restrepo is frustrated that Democrats have failed to put up more of a fight against Republican gains in his home county of Miami-Dade, a<g> liberal </g>stronghold that could be captured by a GOP gubernatorial candidate for the first time in 20 years.",
                "“There’s no way around it. It used to be a toss-up state, but I would say it’s not even close anymore,” said the 39-year old Colombian American teacher, who is a registered Democrat. Restrepo predicts that Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is running for re<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\" target=\"_blank\">election</a> this year, is going to<g> win </g>in Miami-Dade County: “All the Republicans are going to<g> win </g>for sure.”",
                "Although Democrats outnumber Republicans in Miami-Dade, the GOP has continued to make headway with Hispanic voters in the state’s most populous county. A GOP victory in Miami-Dade, where Hispanics make up almost 60 percent of the electorate, would be a stunning turnaround in a county that Hillary Clinton won by almost 30 points just six years ago. DeSantis himself lost the county by more than 20 points four years ago.",
                "The Republican Party has kept up an aggressive year-round ground operation in Miami-Dade, work that has ramped up since former president Donald Trump made major gains with Hispanics here in 2020. The GOP is hoping for a strong overperformance with conservative-leaning Cuban Americans and further gains with the county’s growing Colombian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan and other Hispanic groups this election.Democrats say they aren’t seeing enough enthusiasm from their own party.Democratic state Sen. Annette Taddeo hasn’t shied from calling out Democrats in Florida and nationwide for what she says is a lack of investment and attention to Miami.Taddeo, who is a Colombian American, is facing a battle against Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R) in one of the only competitive House races in the state, and she’s concerned the party hasn’t taken the current political environment as a wake-up call.“Republicans can get slaughtered in an election, and their response is, ‘We need to be more present. We need to be there. We need to invest money,’” Taddeo said. “Democrats do terrible, and they walk away. … That is definitely one of the reasons why things are so tough.”",
                "With Election Day looming, President Biden and Trump are both coming to Miami-Dade to campaign, a sign of the continued importance of the county. On Tuesday, Biden will be campaigning for Democrats Charlie Crist, the  nominee for governor, and Rep. Val Demings, who is challenging Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump is scheduled to stump a few days later for Rubio — but not for DeSantis, who is viewed as a potential 2024 rival.",
                "Democratic leaders and organizers caution that it’s still possible they’ll<g> win </g>the county; the party still boasts the largest number of registered voters in Miami-Dade. But they recognize that a<g> win </g>probably won’t rival Clinton’s performance in the 2016 presidential election and would probably be closer to Biden’s 2020 showing, when he won the county by only seven points.Miami-Dade has more than 575,000 Democrats, 487,000 independents and 435,000 Republicans, according to county registration statistics. Among Hispanics, however, Republicans outnumber Democrats — a gap that is growing.Despite his pessimism about his party, Restrepo said he’s excited to vote for Demings in her bid to unseat Rubio. He said he loves Demings’s “strong voice.” But he said he doesn’t plan to vote for Crist.“I’m going to leave that one blank,” said Restrepo, who said that he canvassed for Crist in past election cycles. He said it’s not that he strongly dislikes Crist but that he thinks of him as “just a career politician.”Interviews with other Democratic voters here show that some are not fully on board with Crist’s bid for governor — even if they aren’t fans of DeSantis — and some feel they don’t know enough about Demings.Roger Ledesma, 43, said he’s discouraged by how contentious he’s seen politics become in South Florida and nationwide. Ledesma, a Democrat, said he doesn’t plan to vote this year because he hasn’t “seen any great-looking candidates running.”Ledesma said he doesn’t see anything positive about DeSantis, whom he compared to a bully. But he said Crist “doesn’t seem like the strongest candidate, but I guess that’s what we’re given on the Democratic side.”Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University, said the issue isn’t the Democrats at the top of the ticket. He said it’s not that Crist is a bad candidate, but that he’s running against a popular incumbent.“Even the best of candidates would have a hard time against DeSantis,” said Gamarra, who polls Latino voters in the United States and throughout Latin America. “I think that’s probably the harshest reality of all.”",
                "During his first term in office, DeSantis has built a national reputation for inflaming culture wars, which has positioned him as a top GOP contender for 2024. But beyond social issues, polls have shown that a majority of voters back how he has handled the pandemic and other challenges facing Floridians.",
                "DeSantis is leading Crist by 51 percent to 44 percent with Florida’s Hispanic voters, according to a new Telemundo/LX News poll. In southeastern Florida, which includes Miami-Dade, 50 percent of Hispanic voters are backing DeSantis, compared with 46 percent supporting Crist, the poll found.The poll also showed DeSantis leading with Hispanic independent voters, 56 percent to 34 percent. And DeSantis is getting 6 percent support from registered Democrats, compared with 1 percent of Republicans backing Crist, the poll found.DeSantis’s more controversial decisions have been supported by Hispanic voters in the state, the poll found. Half of Florida’s Hispanic voters were in favor of the governor’s move last month to fly Venezuelan migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, while 43 percent disapproved.",
                "“Gov. DeSantis is winning in Miami because his agenda is popular and his opponents are a walking arroz con mango,” said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who led Trump’s 2020 national Hispanic advertising, using Cuban slang that means “a messy situation.” “The Democrats could earnestly address their issues with Hispanics, but they prefer to attribute their losses to ‘disinformation.’ This helps them save face with donors, but there’s an electoral price to being so out of touch with reality.”",
                "GOP leaders in South Florida also credit the national party for investing in year-round engagement. The Republican National Committee opened a Hispanic community center in Doral last year that aimed to deepen the party’s connection with the community, with such programs as sessions for immigrants to prepare for the civics portion of the naturalization test.Fernand Amandi, a Democratic consultant and pollster here, agreed that there is a path for DeSantis to<g> win </g>Miami-Dade. The last GOP candidate for governor to accomplish that was former governor Jeb Bush 20 years ago. Bush is fluent in Spanish, and his wife is Latina.",
                "A DeSantis<g> win </g>in Miami-Dade “means that Florida’s electoral votes, probably in the short term, hopefully not in the long term, will be safely in the hands of the Republican Party in presidential years,” Amandi added. “At the presidential level, it will be the declaration of Florida as a solid Republican state and no longer a battleground or swing state.”",
                "Democratic and Republican leaders alike said much of the attention in this election has been on the gubernatorial race, because DeSantis is being watched nationally as a potential presidential contender. But voters are also facing a constant stream of ads about the Senate race between Rubio and Demings, the three-term congresswoman and former Orlando police chief. Although Demings has outraised and outspent Rubio, the Cuban American senator has continued to lead in polls. If Rubio wins the majority of the vote in the county, it would be the first time a GOP Senate candidate has accomplished that since 2004.Demings’s campaign said it has made Hispanic outreach in the county a priority with efforts such as investing in Caribbean radio and TV ads targeting the Afro-Caribbean community and making campaign stops in South Florida to meet with Hispanic voters.Crist’s campaign is “leaving no stone unturned in Miami-Dade where we’ve made multi-million dollar investments to reach voters in both English and Spanish through grassroots, radio, television, and in mailboxes,” spokesperson Samantha Ramirez said in a statement.",
                "Noel Chavez, 49, an independent voter, said that he doesn’t really agree with everything he’s seeing from DeSantis and Rubio but that he’ll still be supporting them this election. For him, the top issue is the economy, as he continues to see inflation affecting his day-to-day expenses.“I don’t like everything about Ron DeSantis, but Charlie Crist is a joke,” said Chavez, a truck driver. “I like Democrats outside of Florida, but the Democratic Party just doesn’t have good leaders in Florida.”",
                "Chavez said Crist’s political résumé — he served as a GOP governor of Florida, lost a 2010 Senate bid in which he ran as an independent, then lost a 2014 bid for governor as a Democrat — suggests that he lacks commitment. Chavez, who came to the United States from Cuba in 2009, said he was a fan of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum in 2018, and these days, he’s a big fan of Beto O’Rourke, this year’s Democratic nominee for governor in Texas.Several Democratic voters in Miami-Dade held out hope that the county would remain blue even if they know DeSantis has a good chance of winning.Nancy Suarez, 46, a teacher, said she supported Crist in the past and is enthusiastically supporting him again.",
                "“The Republicans are just anti-everything. They’re very pro-charter schools. They’re<g><g> trying </g></g>to<g> privatize </g>education here, and that’s what<g> feeds </g>my family,” Suarez said,<g> adding </g>that she’s most<g> focused </g>on<g> protecting </g><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/abortion/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57\" target=\"_blank\">abortion</a> rights, LGBTQ<g><g> rights </g></g>and<g> public </g>education. “People come here for<g> freedom </g>… and they’re<g><g> trying </g></g>to take that away.”",
                "At a recent rally hosted by progressive group Latino Victory in Coral Gables, Angel Montalvo, 29, said he’s excited about some candidates down the ballot and likes Crist’s running mate, Karla Hernandez, president of the United Teachers of Dade. But, he added, “I don’t trust Charlie Crist.”Pebble Yaffe, 32, who attended the event with Montalvo, said, “This is about finding the lesser of the evils.”Yaffe and Montalvo said they’ll still be voting for the Democrats on the ticket.  Montalvo said he feels there’s too much GOP messaging on fighting socialism. “We want health care. We want housing. Let’s focus on that. Nobody cares about communism,” he said.",
                "But Republicans have found success in painting Democrats as socialists. It’s a message that has resonated in the county because it is home to a huge concentration of Hispanic voters and Latin American exiles who fled leftist violence or dictatorships in Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",
                "Raúl Martinez, a Democrat who served for decades as the first Cuban-born mayor of Hialeah, said he’s disappointed with the way campaigns are being run this cycle, with fewer in-person events and a larger emphasis on ads and social media. He’s also worried about Republicans’ success in using socialism to rile up voters and says Democratic candidates just aren’t fighting hard enough.“It’s just not the same Miami that it was in 2016,” Martinez said.",

Restrepo predicts that Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is running for reelection this year, is going to win in Miami-Dade County: “All the Republicans are going to win for sure.”",
                "Although Democrats outnumber Republicans in Miami-Dade, the GOP has continued to make headway with Hispanic voters in the state’s most populous county. A GOP victory in Miami-Dade, where Hispanics make up almost 60 percent of the electorate, would be a stunning turnaround in a county that Hillary Clinton won by almost 30 points just six years ago. DeSantis himself lost the county by more than 20 points four years ago.",
                "The Republican Party has kept up an aggressive year-round ground operation in Miami-Dade, work that has ramped up since former president Donald Trump made major gains with Hispanics here in 2020. The GOP is hoping for a strong overperformance with conservative-leaning Cuban Americans and further gains with the county’s growing Colombian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan and other Hispanic groups this election.Democrats say they aren’t seeing enough enthusiasm from their own party.Democratic state Sen. Annette Taddeo hasn’t shied from calling out Democrats in Florida and nationwide for what she says is a lack of investment and attention to Miami.Taddeo, who is a Colombian American, is facing a battle against Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R) in one of the only competitive House races in the state, and she’s concerned the party hasn’t taken the current political environment as a wake-up call.“Republicans can get slaughtered in an election, and their response is, ‘We need to be more present. We need to be there. We need to invest money,’” Taddeo said. “Democrats do terrible, and they walk away. … That is definitely one of the reasons why things are so tough.”",
                "With Election Day looming, President Biden and Trump are both coming to Miami-Dade to campaign, a sign of the continued importance of the county. On Tuesday, Biden will be campaigning for Democrats Charlie Crist, the  nominee for governor, and Rep. Val Demings, who is challenging Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump is scheduled to stump a few days later for Rubio — but not for DeSantis, who is viewed as a potential 2024 rival.",
                "Democratic leaders and organizers caution that it’s still possible they’ll win the county; the party still boasts the largest number of registered voters in Miami-Dade. But they recognize that a win probably won’t rival Clinton’s performance in the 2016 presidential election and would probably be closer to Biden’s 2020 showing, when he won the county by only seven points.Miami-Dade has more than 575,000 Democrats, 487,000 independents and 435,000 Republicans, according to county registration statistics. Among Hispanics, however, Republicans outnumber Democrats — a gap that is growing.Despite his pessimism about his party, Restrepo said he’s excited to vote for Demings in her bid to unseat Rubio. He said he loves Demings’s “strong voice.” But he said he doesn’t plan to vote for Crist.“I’m going to leave that one blank,” said Restrepo, who said that he canvassed for Crist in past election cycles. He said it’s not that he strongly dislikes Crist but that he thinks of him as “just a career politician.”Interviews with other Democratic voters here show that some are not fully on board with Crist’s bid for governor — even if they aren’t fans of DeSantis — and some feel they don’t know enough about Demings.Roger Ledesma, 43, said he’s discouraged by how contentious he’s seen politics become in South Florida and nationwide. Ledesma, a Democrat, said he doesn’t plan to vote this year because he hasn’t “seen any great-looking candidates running.”Ledesma said he doesn’t see anything positive about DeSantis, whom he compared to a bully. But he said Crist “doesn’t seem like the strongest candidate, but I guess that’s what we’re given on the Democratic side.”Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University, said the issue isn’t the Democrats at the top of the ticket. He said it’s not that Crist is a bad candidate, but that he’s running against a popular incumbent.“Even the best of candidates would have a hard time against DeSantis,” said Gamarra, who polls Latino voters in the United States and throughout Latin America. “I think that’s probably the harshest reality of all.”",
                "During his first term in office, DeSantis has built a national reputation for inflaming culture wars, which has positioned him as a top GOP contender for 2024. But beyond social issues, polls have shown that a majority of voters back how he has handled the pandemic and other challenges facing Floridians.",
                "DeSantis is leading Crist by 51 percent to 44 percent with Florida’s Hispanic voters, according to a new Telemundo/LX News poll. In southeastern Florida, which includes Miami-Dade, 50 percent of Hispanic voters are backing DeSantis, compared with 46 percent supporting Crist, the poll found.The poll also showed DeSantis leading with Hispanic independent voters, 56 percent to 34 percent. And DeSantis is getting 6 percent support from registered Democrats, compared with 1 percent of Republicans backing Crist, the poll found.DeSantis’s more controversial decisions have been supported by Hispanic voters in the state, the poll found. Half of Florida’s Hispanic voters were in favor of the governor’s move last month to fly Venezuelan migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, while 43 percent disapproved.",
                "“Gov. DeSantis is winning in Miami because his agenda is popular and his opponents are a walking arroz con mango,” said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who led Trump’s 2020 national Hispanic advertising, using Cuban slang that means “a messy situation.” “The Democrats could earnestly address their issues with Hispanics, but they prefer to attribute their losses to ‘disinformation.’ This helps them save face with donors, but there’s an electoral price to being so out of touch with reality.”",
                "GOP leaders in South Florida also credit the national party for investing in year-round engagement. The Republican National Committee opened a Hispanic community center in Doral last year that aimed to deepen the party’s connection with the community, with such programs as sessions for immigrants to prepare for the civics portion of the naturalization test.Fernand Amandi, a Democratic consultant and pollster here, agreed that there is a path for DeSantis to win Miami-Dade. The last GOP candidate for governor to accomplish that was former governor Jeb Bush 20 years ago. Bush is fluent in Spanish, and his wife is Latina.",
                "A DeSantis win in Miami-Dade “means that Florida’s electoral votes, probably in the short term, hopefully not in the long term, will be safely in the hands of the Republican Party in presidential years,” Amandi added. “At the presidential level, it will be the declaration of Florida as a solid Republican state and no longer a battleground or swing state.”",
                "Democratic and Republican leaders alike said much of the attention in this election has been on the gubernatorial race, because DeSantis is being watched nationally as a potential presidential contender. But voters are also facing a constant stream of ads about the Senate race between Rubio and Demings, the three-term congresswoman and former Orlando police chief. Although Demings has outraised and outspent Rubio, the Cuban American senator has continued to lead in polls. If Rubio wins the majority of the vote in the county, it would be the first time a GOP Senate candidate has accomplished that since 2004.Demings’s campaign said it has made Hispanic outreach in the county a priority with efforts such as investing in Caribbean radio and TV ads targeting the Afro-Caribbean community and making campaign stops in South Florida to meet with Hispanic voters.Crist’s campaign is “leaving no stone unturned in Miami-Dade where we’ve made multi-million dollar investments to reach voters in both English and Spanish through grassroots, radio, television, and in mailboxes,” spokesperson Samantha Ramirez said in a statement.",
                "Noel Chavez, 49, an independent voter, said that he doesn’t really agree with everything he’s seeing from DeSantis and Rubio but that he’ll still be supporting them this election. For him, the top issue is the economy, as he continues to see inflation affecting his day-to-day expenses.“I don’t like everything about Ron DeSantis, but Charlie Crist is a joke,” said Chavez, a truck driver. “I like Democrats outside of Florida, but the Democratic Party just doesn’t have good leaders in Florida.”",
                "Chavez said Crist’s political résumé — he served as a GOP governor of Florida, lost a 2010 Senate bid in which he ran as an independent, then lost a 2014 bid for governor as a Democrat — suggests that he lacks commitment. Chavez, who came to the United States from Cuba in 2009, said he was a fan of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum in 2018, and these days, he’s a big fan of Beto O’Rourke, this year’s Democratic nominee for governor in Texas.Several Democratic voters in Miami-Dade held out hope that the county would remain blue even if they know DeSantis has a good chance of winning.Nancy Suarez, 46, a teacher, said she supported Crist in the past and is enthusiastically supporting him again.",

                "At a recent rally hosted by progressive group Latino Victory in Coral Gables, Angel Montalvo, 29, said he’s excited about some candidates down the ballot and likes Crist’s running mate, Karla Hernandez, president of the United Teachers of Dade. But, he added, “I don’t trust Charlie Crist.”Pebble Yaffe, 32, who attended the event with Montalvo, said, “This is about finding the lesser of the evils.”Yaffe and Montalvo said they’ll still be voting for the Democrats on the ticket.  Montalvo said he feels there’s too much GOP messaging on fighting socialism. “We want health care. We want housing. Let’s focus on that. Nobody cares about communism,” he said.",
                "But Republicans have found success in painting Democrats as socialists. It’s a message that has resonated in the county because it is home to a huge concentration of Hispanic voters and Latin American exiles who fled leftist violence or dictatorships in Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",
                "Raúl Martinez, a Democrat who served for decades as the first Cuban-born mayor of Hialeah, said he’s disappointed with the way campaigns are being run this cycle, with fewer in-person events and a larger emphasis on ads and social media. He’s also worried about Republicans’ success in using socialism to rile up voters and says Democratic candidates just aren’t fighting hard enough.“It’s just not the same Miami that it was in 2016,” Martinez said."

                "Though based in Houston, Texas, and run by American CEO John Houghtaling, 88 percent of American Ethane was owned by three Russian nationals—Konstantin Nikolaev, Mikhail Yuriev, and Andrey Kunatbaev.

Weintraub and Broussard noted that the FEC found that American Ethane “made contributions using<g> funds </g>derived from loans from foreign entities ultimately owned by Russian nationals.” Federal law bans foreign<g> funds </g>in US elections, as well as direct corporate donations to candidates. American Ethane seems to have done both. The FEC found that the<g> company </g>made more than $66,000 in donations using money it got from offshore firms in the form of loans. According to an FEC general counsel’s <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/murs/7491/7491_20.pdf\">report</a> released last year, the owners of the offshore firms included Alexander Voloshin, a Russian politician and<g> former </g>state power<g> company </g>official, and Roman Abramovich, an infamous Russian oligarch and<g> former </g>owner of the British football powerhouse Chelsea. The money the company<g> used </g>to dole out donations ultimately came from the oligarchs, the FEC said.",
                "During<g> its </g>four-year investigation, the FEC found that the<g> funds </g>initially put up by Abromovich and other Russian nationals were then funneled to Republicans in Louisiana: Sens. John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy, a political action committee run by Kennedy, a leadership fund run&nbsp;by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a PAC backing Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, and the campaigns of Reps. Mike Johnson and Garrett Graves. Other contributions went to state lawmakers. The report didn’t explain why the<g> company </g>focused on Louisiana but the state is home to many natural gas firms, and<g> its </g>lawmakers advocate for the industry.The lawmakers who received<g> funds </g>have not been accused of knowingly taking Russian money, though the final report from the initial investigation noted, “American Ethane attempted to make more political contributions, but those recipient committees never deposited American Ethane’s checks.”American Ethane argued that the<g> funds </g>the<g> company </g>first received appeared as loan to the American corporation. Therefore, they claimed the donations it made were not foreign. The FEC rejected that argument. But it still recommended the<g><g> firm </g></g>only pay $9,500 as a civil penalty.“The foreign-influence problem has not gone<g> away </g>in the meantime, to put it mildly,” Weintraub and Broussard wrote. “In this case, it is beyond unfortunate that for three of our colleagues, it was a bridge too far to penalize the use of Russian oligarchs’ money to influence U.S. elections.”",

                "Though based in Houston, Texas, and run by American CEO John Houghtaling, 88 percent of American Ethane was owned by three Russian nationals—Konstantin Nikolaev, Mikhail Yuriev, and Andrey Kunatbaev. The FEC report said that Nikolaev, an oligarch and Russian billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is the controlling shareholder. Separately, Nikolaev also underwrote efforts by Maria Butina, a Russian gun rights activist, to cultivate ties with the National Rifle Association officials and with associates of Donald Trump around the time of the 2016 election. In 2018, Butina acknowledged acting as an unregistered Kremlin agent and pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy against the United States. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison but was deported six months later.",
                "According to lobbying disclosures, the company was seeking help from US officials in its efforts to sell US ethane to China and, in 2018, had hired a US lobbying firm, Turnberry Solutions, with close ties to former Trump campaign chief Corey Lewandowski. A year later, Lewandowki officially joined Turnberry, after previously disputing his connections to the firm. Turnberry, which traded on ties to Trump, shut down in 2021, months after he left office.",
                "The FEC investigation began after it received a complaint citing press reports on American Ethane’s ties to Nikolaev and its donations to lawmakers. Weintraub and Broussard noted that the FEC found that American Ethane “made contributions using funds derived from loans from foreign entities ultimately owned by Russian nationals.” Federal law bans foreign funds in US elections, as well as direct corporate donations to candidates. American Ethane seems to have done both. The FEC found that the company made more than $66,000 in donations using money it got from offshore firms in the form of loans. According to an FEC general counsel’s report released last year, the owners of the offshore firms included Alexander Voloshin, a Russian politician and former state power company official, and Roman Abramovich, an infamous Russian oligarch and former owner of the British football powerhouse Chelsea. The money the company used to dole out donations ultimately came from the oligarchs, the FEC said.",
                "During its four-year investigation, the FEC found that the funds initially put up by Abromovich and other Russian nationals were then funneled to Republicans in Louisiana: Sens. John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy, a political action committee run by Kennedy, a leadership fund run by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a PAC backing Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, and the campaigns of Reps. Mike Johnson and Garrett Graves. Other contributions went to state lawmakers. The report didn’t explain why the company focused on Louisiana but the state is home to many natural gas firms, and its lawmakers advocate for the industry.The lawmakers who received funds have not been accused of knowingly taking Russian money, though the final report from the initial investigation noted, “American Ethane attempted to make more political contributions, but those recipient committees never deposited American Ethane’s checks.”American Ethane argued that the funds the company first received appeared as loan to the American corporation. Therefore, they claimed the donations it made were not foreign. The FEC rejected that argument. But it still recommended the firm only pay $9,500 as a civil penalty.“The foreign-influence problem has not gone away in the meantime, to put it mildly,” Weintraub and Broussard wrote. “In this case, it is beyond unfortunate that for three of our colleagues, it was a bridge too far to penalize the use of Russian oligarchs’ money to influence U.S. elections.”"

                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Campaigning alongside Michigan Gov. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/politics/whitmer-dixon-debate-michigan-governor-takeaways\" target=\"_blank\">Gretchen Whitmer</a> in Detroit, and later Wisconsin Gov. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/wisconsin-governor-tony-evers-tim-michels\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Evers</a> and Democratic Senate nominee <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/politics/kfile-mandela-barnes-signaled-support-abolish-ice\" target=\"_blank\">Mandela Barnes</a> in Milwaukee, Obama acknowledged the economic realities Americans face. But he said handing power on Capitol Hill to the GOP would do little to solve those problems. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“In your gut, you should have a sense: Who cares about you?” he said in Wisconsin. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>In a moment that rapidly spread across social media, Obama lambasted Barnes’ opponent, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who is seeking a third term. He cited Johnson’s past comments comparing the management of Social Security to a “Ponzi scheme” and criticized Johnson’s vote for the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/20/politics/house-senate-trump-tax-bill\" target=\"_blank\">2017 GOP-led tax overhaul</a>. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“Some of you here are on Social Security. Some of your parents are on Social Security. Some of your grandparents are on Social Security. You know why they have Social Security?” Obama said. “Because they worked for it. They worked hard jobs for it. They have chapped hands for it. They had long hours and sore backs and bad knees to get that Social Security.” \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“And if Ron Johnson does<g> not </g>understand that – if he understands giving tax breaks for private planes more than he understands making sure that seniors who’ve worked all their lives are able to retire with dignity and respect – he’s<g> not </g>the person who’s thinking about you and knows you and sees you, and he should<g> not </g>be your senator from Wisconsin,” the former President said.\n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Obama is traveling<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/obama-campaign-trail-midterms\" target=\"_blank\"> to some of the most important midterm battlegrounds</a> in the days before the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2022\" target=\"_blank\">November 8 midterm elections</a>. In addition to the stops in Michigan and Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/barack-obama-georgia-herschel-walker\" target=\"_blank\">Obama also held an event Friday in Georgia</a>. He will visit Nevada on Tuesday and then hold multiple events in Pennsylvania alongside <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/joe-biden-news\" target=\"_blank\">President Joe Biden</a> on Saturday. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>All five states feature hotly contested governor’s races, and all but Michigan also have Senate contests that will play a role in determining which party controls the evenly divided chamber.\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>The former President on Saturday portrayed the modern GOP as unserious and uncompromising, describing the party – with few exceptions – as beholden to former <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/president-donald-trump-45\" target=\"_blank\">President Donald Trump</a>’s whims. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“Own the libs and getting Donald Trump’s approval. That’s their agenda,” Obama said in Milwaukee. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“They’re<g> not </g>interested in<g> solving </g>problems. They’re<g> interested </g>in making you angry, and then finding somebody to blame,” he said. “And they’re hoping that’ll distract you from the fact that they don’t have any answers of their own.” \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Obama’s message mirrored Biden’s insistence that Republicans have<g> not </g>offered proposals to rein in<g> inflation </g>and his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/biden-harris-joint-campaign-pennsylvania-democrats\" target=\"_blank\">warnings that GOP congressional majorities</a> would target popular safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>It also echoed what former President Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/29/politics/biil-clinton-new-york-sean-patrick-maloney\" target=\"_blank\">said at a campaign stop</a> for Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in New York on Saturday. Clinton said that the GOP’s midterm slogan should be: “This is a real problem. Let’s vote for somebody who will make it worse.” \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>The difference is location: Obama is hitting the campaign trail in<g> places </g>other Democrats can’t visit without provoking costly political backlash. Biden, whose approval rating is underwater in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/cnn-poll-governor-races\" target=\"_blank\">CNN polls conducted by SSRS</a> across key midterm states, is largely limiting his role to fundraisers, though he will travel to Pennsylvania – his state of birth – in the election’s closing weekend. Other figures, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, can energize progressives but have limited appeal beyond core supporters. Obama, though, remains a national Democratic figure who can motivate the party’s base while also appealing to moderate voters. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Obama described<g> inflation </g>as a global challenge that resulted from a coronavirus pandemic that “threw off supply and demand,” as well as Russia’s war in Ukraine, which he said has driven up gas prices.\n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“When gas prices go up, when grocery prices go up, that takes a bite out of people’s paycheck. That hurts,” Obama said. “But the question you should be asking is: Who’s going to do something about it? Republicans are having a field day running ads talking about it, but what is their actual solution to it?”\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“I’ll tell you: They want to gut Social Security, then Medicare, and then give some more tax breaks to the wealthy,” he said. “And the reason I know that’s their agenda is, listen, that’s their answer to everything.” \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>That theme – that Republicans have lost interest in compromising, keeping the government running or even acknowledging basic realities, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election – echoed through Obama’s remarks in Michigan and Wisconsin. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Gone were the days of former first lady <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/politics/michelle-obama-today-show-low-high\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Obama</a>’s insistence that “when they go low, we go high.” Obama acknowledged Saturday that his wife is discouraged by today’s political landscape. “I’m usually a little more optimistic,” he said in Michigan. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>He contrasted the moment the United States now faces with the early stages of his own political career. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>He described <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/30/politics/president-obama-almost-left-politics-axe-files\" target=\"_blank\">losing a 2000 effort</a> to unseat incumbent Rep. Bobby Rush in a Democratic primary – the only time Obama was defeated at the ballot box.\n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“You know what I didn’t do, though? I didn’t claim the election was rigged. I didn’t try to stop votes from being counted. I didn’t incite a mob to storm the Capitol,” Obama said in Detroit. “I took my lumps. I figured out why my campaign hadn’t connected, and I tried to run a better race the next time, because that’s how our democracy is supposed to work.”\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Obama described driving around Illinois as a Senate candidate in 2004, meeting<g> people </g>at diners in conservative areas of the state and having cordial conversations. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>He pointed to the example of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, who delivered a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/mccain.transcript/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">gracious concession speech</a> after losing the 2008 presidential election to Obama. And he said that while he didn’t like the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/election-day-2016-highlights\" target=\"_blank\">outcome of the 2016 presidential race</a>, he stayed up until 3 a.m. to call Trump and congratulate him, and proceed with a peaceful transfer of power. \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>In Milwaukee, Obama even joked about birtherism – the racist conspiracy theory fueled by Trump that Obama was<g> not </g>born in the United States. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Obama compared himself to Barnes, saying the Senate nominee, who is also Wisconsin lieutenant governor, faces a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/wisconsin-senate-election-crime-barnes-johnson\" target=\"_blank\">barrage of Republican ads</a> portraying him as out of touch with the state’s values “just because Mandela’s named Mandela; just because he’s a Democrat with a funny name.”\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“It sounds pretty familiar, doesn’t it? So Mandela,” Obama said, turning to Barnes onstage, “get ready to dig up that birth certificate.” \n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“Remember when that was the craziest thing<g> people </g>said? That wasn’t that long ago. People were like, ‘Wow, that was some crazy stuff,’” Obama said. “Now, it doesn’t even make the top 10 list of crazy.”\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>Obama saved his sharpest criticism for Johnson, saying the GOP senator had a “gold medal” in trafficking conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>In <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/politics/ron-johnson-january-6-flag-poles\" target=\"_blank\">remarks earlier this month</a>, Johnson appeared to downplay the violence from the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/january-6-insurrection\" target=\"_blank\">January 6, 2021, insurrection</a> at the US Capitol and noted that the rioters “did teach us how you can use flagpoles, that<g> kind </g>of stuff, as weapons.” A campaign spokesperson later said the senator’s comments were meant to compare the methods used by racial justice protesters in the summer of 2020 with the January 6 rioters.\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>In a debate with Barnes in October, Johnson said, “I immediately and forcefully and repeatedly condemned the violence on January 6.” \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>In Michigan, Obama warned that a “dangerous climate” was developing as a result of incendiary<g> rhetoric </g>in the United States – “when we don’t just disagree with people, but we start demonizing them making wild crazy allegations about them.”\n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“If<g> elected </g>officials don’t do more to<g> explicitly </g>reject that<g> kind </g>of rhetoric, if they<g> tacitly </g>support or<g> encourage </g>their<g> supporters </g>to<g> stand </g>up<g> outside </g>voting<g> places </g>armed with<g> guns </g>dressed in<g> tactical </g>gear, more<g> people </g>can get hurt,” Obama said.\n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>In a moment Obama used as an exclamation point for his comments about the direction of the GOP, a protester in the audience interrupted him by shouting. That prompted the former President to respond, “So, this is this is what I’m saying.” \n<g>  </g>",
                "\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>“There is a process that we set up in our democracy right now. I’m talking, you’ll have a chance to talk sometime,” he said to the protester. “And this is part of the point that I want to make: Just basic civility and courtesy works, and that’s what we want to try to encourage.”\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g><g>  </g><g>  </g>The protester was quickly drowned out by chants of “Obama!” from the crowd.\n<g>  </g>\n<g>  </g>CNN’s Donald Judd, Omar Jimenez and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.\n",

                "\n      Former President Barack Obama on Saturday sought to sway voters who are worried about inflation, warning in two key Midwestern states that Republicans seeking control of Congress have no plans to rein in prices and could target social safety net programs.\n  ",
                "\n      Campaigning alongside Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Detroit, and later Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic Senate nominee Mandela Barnes in Milwaukee, Obama acknowledged the economic realities Americans face. But he said handing power on Capitol Hill to the GOP would do little to solve those problems. \n  \n      “In your gut, you should have a sense: Who cares about you?” he said in Wisconsin. \n  ",
                "\n      In a moment that rapidly spread across social media, Obama lambasted Barnes’ opponent, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who is seeking a third term. He cited Johnson’s past comments comparing the management of Social Security to a “Ponzi scheme” and criticized Johnson’s vote for the 2017 GOP-led tax overhaul. \n  ",
                "\n      “Some of you here are on Social Security. Some of your parents are on Social Security. Some of your grandparents are on Social Security. You know why they have Social Security?” Obama said. “Because they worked for it. They worked hard jobs for it. They have chapped hands for it. They had long hours and sore backs and bad knees to get that Social Security.” \n  ",
                "\n      “And if Ron Johnson does not understand that – if he understands giving tax breaks for private planes more than he understands making sure that seniors who’ve worked all their lives are able to retire with dignity and respect – he’s not the person who’s thinking about you and knows you and sees you, and he should not be your senator from Wisconsin,” the former President said.\n  ",
                "\n      Obama is traveling to some of the most important midterm battlegrounds in the days before the November 8 midterm elections. In addition to the stops in Michigan and Wisconsin, Obama also held an event Friday in Georgia. He will visit Nevada on Tuesday and then hold multiple events in Pennsylvania alongside President Joe Biden on Saturday. \n  \n      All five states feature hotly contested governor’s races, and all but Michigan also have Senate contests that will play a role in determining which party controls the evenly divided chamber.\n  \n      The former President on Saturday portrayed the modern GOP as unserious and uncompromising, describing the party – with few exceptions – as beholden to former President Donald Trump’s whims. \n  \n      “Own the libs and getting Donald Trump’s approval. That’s their agenda,” Obama said in Milwaukee. \n  ",
                "\n      “They’re not interested in solving problems. They’re interested in making you angry, and then finding somebody to blame,” he said. “And they’re hoping that’ll distract you from the fact that they don’t have any answers of their own.” \n  ",
                "\n      Obama’s message mirrored Biden’s insistence that Republicans have not offered proposals to rein in inflation and his warnings that GOP congressional majorities would target popular safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare. \n  ",
                "\n      It also echoed what former President Bill Clinton said at a campaign stop for Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in New York on Saturday. Clinton said that the GOP’s midterm slogan should be: “This is a real problem. Let’s vote for somebody who will make it worse.” \n  ",
                "\n      The difference is location: Obama is hitting the campaign trail in places other Democrats can’t visit without provoking costly political backlash. Biden, whose approval rating is underwater in CNN polls conducted by SSRS across key midterm states, is largely limiting his role to fundraisers, though he will travel to Pennsylvania – his state of birth – in the election’s closing weekend. Other figures, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, can energize progressives but have limited appeal beyond core supporters. Obama, though, remains a national Democratic figure who can motivate the party’s base while also appealing to moderate voters. \n  \n      Obama described inflation as a global challenge that resulted from a coronavirus pandemic that “threw off supply and demand,” as well as Russia’s war in Ukraine, which he said has driven up gas prices.\n  ",
                "\n      “When gas prices go up, when grocery prices go up, that takes a bite out of people’s paycheck. That hurts,” Obama said. “But the question you should be asking is: Who’s going to do something about it? Republicans are having a field day running ads talking about it, but what is their actual solution to it?”\n  \n      “I’ll tell you: They want to gut Social Security, then Medicare, and then give some more tax breaks to the wealthy,” he said. “And the reason I know that’s their agenda is, listen, that’s their answer to everything.” \n  ",
                "\n      That theme – that Republicans have lost interest in compromising, keeping the government running or even acknowledging basic realities, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election – echoed through Obama’s remarks in Michigan and Wisconsin. \n  ",

Bobby Rush in a Democratic primary – the only time Obama was defeated at the ballot box.\n  ",
                "\n      “You know what I didn’t do, though? I didn’t claim the election was rigged. I didn’t try to stop votes from being counted. I didn’t incite a mob to storm the Capitol,” Obama said in Detroit. “I took my lumps. I figured out why my campaign hadn’t connected, and I tried to run a better race the next time, because that’s how our democracy is supposed to work.”\n  \n      Obama described driving around Illinois as a Senate candidate in 2004, meeting people at diners in conservative areas of the state and having cordial conversations. \n  ",
                "\n      He pointed to the example of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, who delivered a gracious concession speech after losing the 2008 presidential election to Obama. And he said that while he didn’t like the outcome of the 2016 presidential race, he stayed up until 3 a.m. to call Trump and congratulate him, and proceed with a peaceful transfer of power. \n  \n      In Milwaukee, Obama even joked about birtherism – the racist conspiracy theory fueled by Trump that Obama was not born in the United States. \n  ",
                "\n      Obama compared himself to Barnes, saying the Senate nominee, who is also Wisconsin lieutenant governor, faces a barrage of Republican ads portraying him as out of touch with the state’s values “just because Mandela’s named Mandela; just because he’s a Democrat with a funny name.”\n  \n      “It sounds pretty familiar, doesn’t it? So Mandela,” Obama said, turning to Barnes onstage, “get ready to dig up that birth certificate.” \n  \n      “Remember when that was the craziest thing people said? That wasn’t that long ago. People were like, ‘Wow, that was some crazy stuff,’” Obama said. “Now, it doesn’t even make the top 10 list of crazy.”\n  \n      Obama saved his sharpest criticism for Johnson, saying the GOP senator had a “gold medal” in trafficking conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. \n  ",
                "\n      In remarks earlier this month, Johnson appeared to downplay the violence from the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and noted that the rioters “did teach us how you can use flagpoles, that kind of stuff, as weapons.” A campaign spokesperson later said the senator’s comments were meant to compare the methods used by racial justice protesters in the summer of 2020 with the January 6 rioters.\n  \n      In a debate with Barnes in October, Johnson said, “I immediately and forcefully and repeatedly condemned the violence on January 6.” \n  ",
                "\n      In Michigan, Obama warned that a “dangerous climate” was developing as a result of incendiary rhetoric in the United States – “when we don’t just disagree with people, but we start demonizing them making wild crazy allegations about them.”\n  ",
                "\n      “If elected officials don’t do more to explicitly reject that kind of rhetoric, if they tacitly support or encourage their supporters to stand up outside voting places armed with guns dressed in tactical gear, more people can get hurt,” Obama said.\n  ",

                "\"Imagine if instead of coming up with a story about how us having to watch Tiger King in our sweatpants was some kind of government plot, imagine if she spent some time coming up with some ideas about how to create some more jobs here in Michigan or to get folks more healthcare or to improve our schools,\" he said. \"That's what you want from the governor of your state.\"Later, while campaigning in Milwaukee, Obama blasted Republican Sen. Ron Johnson for his attacks on Social Security in a moment that went viral on social media.\"Some of you here are on Social Security. Some of your parents are on Social Security. Some of your grandparents are on Social Security. You know why they have Social Security?\" Obama said.\"Because they worked for it. They worked hard jobs for it. They have chapped hands for it. They had long hours and sore backs and bad knees to get that Social Security.\"",
                "If Johnson \"does not understand that, if he understands giving tax breaks for private planes more than he understands making sure that seniors who've worked all their lives are able to retire with dignity and respect, he's not the person who's thinking about you and knows you and sees you, and he should not be your senator from Wisconsin,\" Obama added, prompting raucous applause.Newsweek has contacted Johnson's campaign for comment."

An internet user with the handle “daviddepape” voiced support of the former US president Donald Trump and seeming belief in the conspiracy theory QAnon.Insurrectionists invaded and vandalized Pelosi’s office during the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by extreme Trump supporters. The rioters had been inspired by the then president, attacking law enforcement in an attempt to overturn Biden’s win.Some Capitol rioters sought out Pelosi, shouting her name; she escaped with other politicians and subsequently spearheaded efforts to secure the Capitol so that Congress could certify Biden’s victory.",
                "New York City police warned on Thursday that extremists might target politicians, polling sites, and political events in advance of the 2022 midterm elections. Threats have increased dramatically in recent years, with the US Capitol police reporting that they investigated 9,625 threats against lawmakers in 2021 – an approximately threefold increase from 2017.“I’m a rank-and-file member who served on a Mueller investigation and had death threats,” Kelly Armstrong, a Republican representative from North Dakota, told Axios. “I think everybody has to take it seriously.”",
                "There have been steps taken to address increasing threats against members of Congress, such as the House sergeant at arms’ announcement in July that all US Representatives will receive a $10,000 security allowance, but these measures have been criticized as insufficient. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic congress member from Washington, said this summer that the allotment would not cover the recommended security measures for her home, per Axios.",
                "There have also been calls for legislative solutions to security concerns, but the attitude toward these concerns might stall along party lines. Mike Sherrill, a Democratic lawmaker from New Jersey, has introduced a bill that would permit judges to protect their personal information, following a 2020 shooting in New Jersey that left a judge’s son dead and her husband injured.",
                "Should Republicans win a majority in Congress, however, Capitol security will change; Republican Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, has criticized the placement of metal detectors outside the House chamber following the January 6 attack. McCarthy has hinted that he would remove them if he were in charge, Axios noted."
