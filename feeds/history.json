The above picture was used by anti-masons and many other that depicted Morgan as a upstanding and educated citizen.

The people in Batavia did not have the most postive view of Morgan. He was often looked at as a uneducated, shrew, and carless man.

Morgan did this very publically and did not shy away from talking about the book her was writing in public to friends and even strangers at the local bar.

Lawrence worked closely with Faisal I bin Al-Hussein bin Ali Al-Hashemi to help defeat the Ottomans, with the Arabs working under the illusion that this would result in a unified Arab state. However, after the conflict, the region was divided up by Britain and France, and the western countries were accused of reneging on the deal.Lawrence’s account of the revolt, <em>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, was published in 1926, but in 1924 he produced a “prospectus” of just 100 copies of the opening chapters of the<g> book </g>to circulate around potential investors in the style of an early crowdfunding project.In it, Lawrence, who died in 1935, maintained that his aim while in the Middle East was always to help the Arabs establish their own sovereignty.He wrote that the Arab<g> revolt </g>was “an Arab<g> war </g>waged and led by Arabs for an Arab aim in Arabia”, and said he believed he was helping them to create “a new nation, to restore a lost influence” and to build “an inspired dream palace of their national thoughts”.","He also indicated some satisfaction when things began to look bad for the western<g> powers </g>that had exerted their influence in the territory after the conflict, writing: “When we won, it was charged against me that the British petrol royalties in Mesopotamia were become dubious, and French colonial policy ruined in the Levant.

Shaw was sent a copy to pass literary judgment on Lawrence’s writing, and as well as urging him to remove the<g> first </g>chapter, he also edited out several potentially libellous comments.","In the excised chapter, Lawrence writes: “For my work on the Arab front I had determined to accept nothing. The cabinet raised the Arabs to fight for us by definite<g> promises </g>of self-government afterwards. Arabs believe in persons, not in institutions. They saw in me a free agent of the British government, and demanded from me an endorsement of its written promises. So I had to join the conspiracy, and, for what my word was worth, assured the men of their reward.“In our two years’ partnership under fire they grew accustomed to believing me and to think my government, like myself, sincere. In this hope they performed some fine things but, of course, instead of being proud of what we did together, I was continually and bitterly ashamed.”","Mitchell said: “This is all made complex by the nature of Lawrence’s personality. The title of one of his many biographies is <em>Backing into the Limelight</em>. He shunned publicity but he also craved attention. He is not going to explicitly say ‘I betrayed the Arabs’, but it is clearly implicit here. In the preface to the trade edition of <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, he gave his reason for omitting it: ‘My best critic [Shaw] told me it was much inferior to the rest.’“The ‘suppressed’<g> first </g>chapter encapsulates Lawrence’s ambiguity about the whole project of telling his story of the Arab revolt.

The cabinet raised the Arabs to fight for us by definite promises of self-government afterwards. Arabs believe in persons, not in institutions. They saw in me a free agent of the British government, and demanded from me an endorsement of its written promises. So I had to join the conspiracy, and, for what my word was worth, assured the men of their reward.“In our two years’ partnership under fire they grew accustomed to believing me and to think my government, like myself, sincere. In this hope they performed some fine things but, of course, instead of being proud of what we did together, I was continually and bitterly ashamed.”","Mitchell said: “This is all made complex by the nature of Lawrence’s personality. The title of one of his many biographies is Backing into the Limelight. He shunned publicity but he also craved attention. He is not going to explicitly say ‘I betrayed the Arabs’, but it is clearly implicit here. In the preface to the trade edition of Seven Pillars of Wisdom, he gave his reason for omitting it: ‘My best critic [Shaw] told me it was much inferior to the rest.’“The ‘suppressed’ first chapter encapsulates Lawrence’s ambiguity about the whole project of telling his story of the Arab revolt. He believed that it was a story that must be told but that he couldn’t tell, despite his intimate involvement.”"],"catagory":"history","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/30/revealed-te-lawrence-felt-bitter-shame-over-uks-false-promises-of-arab-self-rule"},{"image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/10/29/8f8c4684-337d-4779-8995-8bda22a3c705/thumbnail/1200x630/5cab3f6647bc58cbe7c50d8fd14ca9d2/gettyimages-1244303897.jpg","title":"Human burial grounds and bullets from Spanish guns uncovered at site of last Mayan stronghold in Guatemala","slides":["\n        <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/world?ftag=CNM-16-10abg0d\" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\">\n          World\n          </a>\n      \n          <time datetime=\"2022-10-29T12:08:10-0400\">October 29, 2022 / 12:08 PM</time>\n          / CBS/AFP\n        <span> Laser tech uncovers more Mayan ruins </span>\n                \n      ","Ceramics,<g> human </g>burial<g> grounds </g>and<g> bullets </g>from Spanish<g> guns </g>are among artifacts that have been<g> uncovered </g>by archaeologists in Guatemala at the<g> site </g>of the<g> last </g>Mayan city to resist European conquest, officials said Friday.","The new excavation project began<g> last </g>June in an effort to understand more about the Tayasal outpost where Mayan inhabitants first settled in<g> 900 </g>BC during their Preclassic period, the archeologist in charge of the dig told AFP.","Tayasal was the<g> last </g>Mayan city to yield to the Spanish conquest in 1697, a century after Europeans entered the western highlands of what is now Guatemala, Suarlin Cordova said.","\"More than 100 years passed in which the northern part of Guatemala was totally outside of Spanish rule, and this happened mainly because the jungle functioned as a natural border that made the arrival of the Spaniards to these places very difficult,\" Cordova said.In 1525, Tayasal was also part of the route used by Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes on his journey to present-day Honduras.Most of the buildings at the Tayasal<g> site </g>are buried under earth and vegetation inside a seven-square-kilometer area near Lake Peten Itza.","Among partially exposed structures at the<g> site </g>is a 30-meter-high acropolis that according to research functioned as the residence of the ruling elite.Also visible is a water well used since pre-Hispanic times.","One of the objectives of the project is to enhance the<g> site </g>so tourists can better \"appreciate\" the vast region's Mayan archaeological value, said Jenny Barrios from Guatemala's <a href=\"https://mcd.gob.gt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ministry of Culture and Sports</a>.","The Maya<g> civilization </g>reached<g> its </g>height between<g> 250 </g>and<g> 900 </g>AD in what is present-day<g> southern </g>Mexico and Guatemala, as well as<g> parts </g>of Belize, El Salvador and Honduras.","In 2018, archaeologists used high-tech mapping technology to virtually unearth a massive network of Mayan ruins hidden for centuries in the thick jungles of Guatemala, CBS News' David Begnaud <span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mayan-ruin-discovery-lidar-laser-technology/\" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\">reported</a></span>.","The<g> uncovered </g>landscape included previously unknown cities and more than 60,000 interconnected structures including houses, farms, highways and even pyramids.
