A Conversation with Lorraine Daston | The Marginalia Review of Books","slides":[{"text":"<mark>A</mark>s part of our Meanings of Science in the Modern World project, I had the honor of speaking with Dr. Lorraine Daston. A leading authority on the<g> history </g>of science, Daston is visiting professor in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago, Permanent Fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin, and Director Emerita of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin. &nbsp;"},{"text":"Daston has published on a wide range of topics in the<g> history </g>of science. Her more recent<g> books </g>include<em> Rules: A Short History of What We Live By </em>(Princeton University Press, 2022), <em>Gegen die Natur</em> (2018; English edition <em>Against Nature</em>, 2019), <em>Science in the Archives </em>(University of Chicago Press, 2017), and <em>How Reason Almost Lost Its Mind: The Strange Career of Cold War Rationality</em>&nbsp;(with Paul Erikson et al., University of Chicago Press 2014). Her many distinguished lectures, honors, and fellowships include the Sarton Medal from the History of Science Society for “lifetime scholarly achievement.”&nbsp;Over the course of a lively and generous conversation, Daston shared her expertise on<g> science </g>and some of the challenges it faces today. We began with the conception of “science” in Europe and America, which led to a rich discussion about what can happen when we ask<g> scientists </g>to be cultural authorities, the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>as relates to moral and ethical training, the crisis of peer-review, the perks and problems of working in strictly defined disciplines, and the strengths of an international scientific community.We began by chatting informally about<g> science </g>and its various meanings in America and Europe, which led to my first question:What do you make of the dominance of the conception of “science,” as someone who’s familiar with the European context? “Science” has narrowed its meaning in the English language, moving from the whole of knowledge to just the natural sciences. This narrowness is fairly recent: the mid- to late-nineteenth century is when historians tell us our current idea of “science” and “scientists” originated. So how do you see the current role of the word and concept “science” in our culture?"},{"text":"<mark>Y</mark>ou’re right about the contraction of the expansiveness of “science,” which in all the European languages that derived some cognate from the Latin <em>scientia</em> used to refer to any form of organized knowledge. But it contracts not only in English but also in French, albeit a bit later in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. The French term for the scientist or scholar goes from being <em>savant</em>, which is still a word you can easily encounter in nineteenth-century French, to <em>scientifique</em> to refer exclusively to a scientist. And it surely has to do with the soaring prestige of the natural sciences, which is also the case in Germany.&nbsp;"},{"text":"There were many anxious lectures given at the end of the nineteenth century, the turn of the twentieth century, about how the <em>Naturwissenschaften</em> (the natural sciences) were edging out the <em>Geisteswissenschaften</em> (what we would call the humanities, although that’s a very rough translation). But the reason is the same in all cases, and it’s made very explicit in these anxious lectures: the natural sciences, after centuries of promissory notes, have finally come into their own with regard to impressive applications, first in the chemical industries of the mid-nineteenth century, but then in the applications of electricity and magnetism in the latter part of the nineteenth century (the worldwide telegraph system, for example). At that point, you do indeed have a contraction of the word “science” and its use as a closely guarded honorific in French and English.&nbsp;"},{"text":"In German, it’s the enormous prestige of at least some of the humanities, particularly classical philology, which, I think, ends up making that contraction impossible—not that there wasn’t a movement in the identical direction. One has to remember that in Germany, even the luminaries of the natural sciences, someone like Hermann von Helmholtz or Emil du Bois-Reymond, the great physiologist, would have had a classical education at a Gymnasium. So they had been schooled in Latin and Greek, thought of this as part of shared high culture, and did not wish to sacrifice their credentials as members of a cultural elite. As<g> long </g>as the classics were enshrined in elite secondary education, the place of classical philology as the hardest of the hard sciences was secure. I remember when I taught in the early 1990s at the University of Göttingen—famous for its mathematics and physics in the twentieth century—I gave a talk at their Academy of Sciences, where the President was a classical philologist and the Vice President was an experimental physicist. I was told afterwards that this was because classical philology is harder than experimental physics. I’m not sure this would still be the case, but within living memory it had been."},{"text":"That’s fascinating because it points then to the importance of culture. For Germans, the idea of <em>Wissenschaft</em> is linked to the idea of <em>Bildung</em>, and the Gymnasium program is linked to an ideal that comes out of the late eighteenth and nineteenth century with people like Schleiermacher and Humboldt. Do you see that as connected to the distinctive<g> development </g>of, say, German science? Obviously, there are tremendous developments happening in the nineteenth century in French science, but it is the century of Germany. So even just from a competitive standpoint, would you say there’s maybe some advantage, if you want to evaluate, to the German broadness? That that system of <em>Bildung</em>, that broader vision of education, might have produced? You have<g> scientists </g>and physicists who have a much broader vision, because in their mind they’re really thinking <em>Wissenschaft</em>, and <em>Wissenschaft</em> really is something inclusive that has to do with the whole in its ideal rather than just this very narrow—I guess what we’d call—<em>Fachmenschen</em>-type of work, which we would actually think of as a “scientist” in the American or English-speaking context."},{"text":"<mark>Y</mark>es, I think that’s very interesting. There’s certainly, for good or for ill, the notion that intellectuals—professors, not just<g> public </g>intellectuals, but academics—are <em>Kulturträger</em>, carriers of culture. I say for good or for ill, because that can be very easily abused, and people who are basically citizens like you and I will be asked to pontificate by the media on a topic of which they know not. But the other side of that, for good, is that there is something of an expectation that a scientist in her or his field should be able to present a lucid, well-informed lecture to a <em>gebildetes Publikum</em> (a generally educated audience), explaining not only the chief results of his or her research, but also their broader significance.It’s historically fascinating to look at the contrast between, for example, how the pioneers of quantum mechanics in Germany—people like Schrödinger and Heisenberg and also Niels Bohr in Copenhagen—philosophized about the implications of this highly counterintuitive, remarkable new theory, whereas their American colleagues were narrowly focused on the solution of technical problems. So you see the signature of this implicit embedding in the broader landscape of <em>Wissenschaft</em>, even in the most technical, scientific work.When you mentioned Schrödinger, I thought of this quote by him from his 1951 lecture: <em>it<g> seems </g>plain and self-evident, yet it needs to be said: the isolated knowledge obtained by a group of specialists in a narrow field has in itself no value whatsoever, but only in its synthesis with all the rest of knowledge and only inasmuch as it really contributes in this synthesis toward answering the demand, ‘Who are we?’</em>Do you think it’s a problem with the current<g> public </g>understanding of<g> science </g>that the vision of<g> science </g>which has come to dominate is one in which the ideal isn’t a broadly cultivated person, and yet<g> scientists </g>wield an enormous cultural authority and are asked to speak very generally about the significance of their work, and the culture and the publishing industry wants that and encourages it?<mark>I</mark> think it’s a landscape which is mined with all kinds of dangers for scientists. On the one hand, because<g> so </g>much of research is publicly funded—over 90%, I think, still in the United States—not only might the media demand that<g> scientists </g>speak to the public; the<g> public </g>has a right to understand why it’s worth supporting science.&nbsp;"},{"text":"So the<g> fact </g>that<g> scientists </g>attempt to<g> explain </g>their<g> work </g>to the<g> public </g>seems to me an<g> entirely </g>gratifying<g> development </g>and<g> long </g>overdue. I’m delighted that the old stigma that used to be attached to<g> scientists </g>who would write a popular book or a textbook is fast disappearing. So that, I think, is an extremely positive development. The problem comes when the<g> scientists </g>are tempted to stray out of an area where they are genuinely experts. For example, although I am a historian, I certainly would never contemplate or countenance offering an opinion on the<g> history </g>of the American West, because I really am not better informed on that topic than your average Jane Q. Citizen.&nbsp;"},{"text":"But the scientists, because of, as you say, capital-S science, are increasingly—particularly, of course, during the pandemic, but also in the context of climate change—being pushed into the limelight with a microphone put in front of them. That’s a situation which is dangerous for them and dangerous for the public. There’s an additional element that probably erodes what would otherwise be their professional inhibitions about straying from their area of expertise. Because<g> science </g>is publicly funded, to have an article about your<g> work </g>published in the <em>LA Times</em> or <em>The New York Times</em> or in Germany in <em>Die Zeit</em> or the <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em> is considered a real perk. It’s something that could possibly have an impact, however indirectly, on the future funding for your research in a highly competitive field. These considerations also add a motivation, first of all, to go to the popular press before you go to the specialist press, before it’s gone through peer review, and secondly, perhaps, to exaggerate the significance of your findings.&nbsp;That’s why I think that the<g> scientists </g>are being forced to walk a tightrope between a laudable desire to communicate with the<g> public </g>and the temptation to hype their results for journalists. This is a situation not<g> entirely </g>of their own making. I think the professional disciplinary organizations or perhaps the American Association for the Advancement of Science needs to offer some guidance on what the professional ethics are in such situations.And in relationship to such guidance, where would you position your own field? Should<g> scientists </g>know the<g> history </g>of science? Do you see what you do as part of science?<mark>I</mark> certainly see it as a discipline with rigorous standards. Because I’m a historian of the pre-modern period, the ancient origins of the word <em>historia</em> are always echoing in my mind’s ear. When I hear <em>historia</em>, I hear: we are the people who invented empiricism, all kinds of empiricism; we are the people who study particulars. We historians are not the whole of science, but we are the trailblazers of empiricism.&nbsp;"},{"text":"I think of<g> history </g>as a discipline, one that invented and is still inventing ever new rigorous methods for not only the cross-examination of the sources we have, but even more importantly, the discovery of sources we don’t yet have. I look upon the integration of many different strands of evidence braided together into a strong rope of argument in<g> history </g>as identical, philosophically to the practices of any science. This is one of the reasons why the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>is, of use to<g> science </g>and scholarship. All of these methods, which constitute, taken <em>in toto</em>, rigor in any given scholarly or scientific discipline develop at different times under different circumstances. Without knowledge of how differently, for example, in medicine, clinical observation and randomized clinical trials developed, you have no clue, no foothold in the next task, which is: how do you weigh these two kinds of evidence? How do you integrate them? And that holds, I think, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, for all scientific disciplines. So that’s one good reason why the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>is of use to not only the sciences, but all branches of scholarship.I think you make an extremely compelling case for<g> history </g>and the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>particularly as a kind of<g> science </g>in the broad sense of a very technical, rigorous discipline. However, as you know, in the natural scientific community, historians of<g> science </g>are not a standard part of their education. I wonder, and this is a large topic, but do you think that it’s a mistake in the current natural scientific community that the<g> history </g>of science, based on what you said, is ignored?"},{"text":"<mark>I</mark> do, and I hope that doesn’t sound like provincial special pleading for my own discipline. Let me<g> explain </g>why I think it’s a mistake. We often have at the institute that until recently I co-directed in Berlin, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, scientists, young scientists, coming to us after they have finished a PhD in physics or biology or chemistry, but especially the life sciences, and wanting to do some kind of postdoc with us. It’s certainly of no use to them whatsoever professionally; on the contrary, I’m sure on their CVs, it would stand out like a sore thumb. But the reason is that, because of the combination of the narrowness of research specialization and the intense pressure to produce results quickly, they have no overview of their field. Or perhaps to put it more provocatively, they don’t know why they’re working on what they’re working on. Moreover, they don’t know what the alternatives are.&nbsp;The<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>has always served two purposes. One purpose has been to give that kind of orientation, really in the Kantian sense: Here’s how the field has developed; this is why it has taken this path rather than another path. In some disciplines—psychology might be a good candidate for this—there were roads not taken or abandoned, which perhaps are more promising in retrospect because they showed very robust empirical effects. I’m thinking of Gestalt psychology, for example.&nbsp;"},{"text":"So that’s one important use of the<g> history </g>of science: to train scientists. Another use, of course, is for almost any science, to prepare<g> scientists </g>for decisions that no<g> science </g>textbook can prepare them for, namely, ethical decisions. Increasingly, especially in the biomedical sciences, but one thinks also of the Manhattan Project—involving, physics and chemistry—scientists will be confronted with decisions about research that has ethical implications. The<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>is not an ethics course, but it can offer case studies of how<g> scientists </g>have dealt well or badly with this in the past and what the consequences have been. One might describe this as a form of sensitization about the importance of making these decisions in a somewhat wider context.&nbsp;"},{"text":"So I think that’s what the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>can offer the scientists. I think one reason why the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>has disappeared from<g> science </g>courses is that it’s no longer offering what the<g> scientists </g>wanted from it, which was a<g> history </g>of triumph, a<g> history </g>of why it is that what we believe now is the only possible, reasonable theory we could embrace. But if there is one moral to the<g> history </g>of<g> science </g>it is: whatever we believe now, we probably won’t believe and should not believe in 10 to 25 years when research has enlightened us further; and to deprive<g> scientists </g>of that triumphal teleology has for many<g> scientists </g>been an enormous disappointment. They’ve simply stopped reading the<g> history </g>of science. . .Part Two will be published in our next issue!

Without knowledge of how differently, for example, in medicine, clinical observation and randomized clinical trials developed, you have no clue, no foothold in the next task, which is: how do you weigh these two kinds of evidence? How do you integrate them? And that holds, I think, mutatis mutandis, for all scientific disciplines. So that’s one good reason why the history of science is of use to not only the sciences, but all branches of scholarship.I think you make an extremely compelling case for history and the history of science particularly as a kind of science in the broad sense of a very technical, rigorous discipline. However, as you know, in the natural scientific community, historians of science are not a standard part of their education. I wonder, and this is a large topic, but do you think that it’s a mistake in the current natural scientific community that the history of science, based on what you said, is ignored?","I do, and I hope that doesn’t sound like provincial special pleading for my own discipline. Let me explain why I think it’s a mistake. We often have at the institute that until recently I co-directed in Berlin, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, scientists, young scientists, coming to us after they have finished a PhD in physics or biology or chemistry, but especially the life sciences, and wanting to do some kind of postdoc with us. It’s certainly of no use to them whatsoever professionally; on the contrary, I’m sure on their CVs, it would stand out like a sore thumb. But the reason is that, because of the combination of the narrowness of research specialization and the intense pressure to produce results quickly, they have no overview of their field. Or perhaps to put it more provocatively, they don’t know why they’re working on what they’re working on. Moreover, they don’t know what the alternatives are. The history of science has always served two purposes. One purpose has been to give that kind of orientation, really in the Kantian sense: Here’s how the field has developed; this is why it has taken this path rather than another path. In some disciplines—psychology might be a good candidate for this—there were roads not taken or abandoned, which perhaps are more promising in retrospect because they showed very robust empirical effects. I’m thinking of Gestalt psychology, for example. ","So that’s one important use of the history of science: to train scientists. Another use, of course, is for almost any science, to prepare scientists for decisions that no science textbook can prepare them for, namely, ethical decisions. Increasingly, especially in the biomedical sciences, but one thinks also of the Manhattan Project—involving, physics and chemistry—scientists will be confronted with decisions about research that has ethical implications. The history of science is not an ethics course, but it can offer case studies of how scientists have dealt well or badly with this in the past and what the consequences have been. One might describe this as a form of sensitization about the importance of making these decisions in a somewhat wider context. ","So I think that’s what the history of science can offer the scientists. I think one reason why the history of science has disappeared from science courses is that it’s no longer offering what the scientists wanted from it, which was a history of triumph, a history of why it is that what we believe now is the only possible, reasonable theory we could embrace. But if there is one moral to the history of science it is: whatever we believe now, we probably won’t believe and should not believe in 10 to 25 years when research has enlightened us further; and to deprive scientists of that triumphal teleology has for many scientists been an enormous disappointment. They’ve simply stopped reading the history of science. . .Part Two will be published in our next issue!

The Reimann family fortune is estimated at €33 billion. The family decided to confront its dark past and donated millions of euros to nonprofit organizations devoted to helping religious and national minorities and seeking out the families of the war prisoners forced to work for the grandfather’s firm."},{"text":"This was just one recent case showing how Nazi tycoons had been able to cover up their dark pasts in<g> postwar </g>West Germany.

Companies like Siemens, Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler-Benz, Dr. Oetker, Porsche, Krupp, IG Farben, and many more cooperated with the SS, which built “satellite concentration camps” near these private companies’ factories and mines where slave laborers toiled in the most appalling conditions. While, after 1945, legal proceedings were launched against Nazi businessmen, almost none would be punished. Industrialists like Günther Quandt, Friedrich Flick, and Ferdinand Porsche were even allowed to keep their assets and continue business as usual. During the “economic miracle” of the 1950s in Germany, they made even bigger fortunes, and their family businesses remain among the most powerful in Germany. Some have even continued to support far-right political parties."},{"text":"But how did the relationship between Adolf Hitler and the business and financial elite develop during the interwar period?

How would you describe the relationship between Germany’s financial and industrial elite and the Nazi Party?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"I would agree that in a way most of the men that I write about were sheer opportunists. These families were already very rich before Hitler seized power in 1933, with the exception of the Porsche-Piëch family, which laid the foundations for their wealth during the Third Reich. They were leading business families during the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, in West Germany, and still today in unified Germany. These businessmen looked to maximize profit, and they<g> thrived </g>in any political system. I would even argue that they would have somehow risen to the top even in a communist system. Their main goal was to maximize profit and expand their business empires and fortunes regardless of the political system."},{"text":"These men became interested in Hitler and the Nazi Party once it had his first electoral success in Germany in September 1930. It was the<g> period </g>when the Great Depression hit Germany with a wave of discontent and unemployment. The entire business world hung in the balance, and that, for the first time, opened the door for Hitler to Germany’s business community, which had before mostly supported establishment conservative figures. It opened the door for them to have conversations, but they didn’t really start supporting Hitler until he came to power on January 30, 1933. In that meeting that you refer to, he<g> promised </g>them something that he initially delivered on, which is economic and political stability and the rearmament of Germany, which they greatly profited from. They made billions of reichsmarks that were flowing to them from their steel, machinery, and car companies that were retooled to produce weapons and war material.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>Hitler gave them the means to make more<g> money </g>and control anything they wanted in exchange for their loyalty.<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"He<g> promised </g>to make them more money, but also to<g> protect </g>their interests, because it was a very<g> unstable </g>period. Sure, it was about making more money, but that was always their bottom line. But now it was also really about reviving their companies, getting Germany’s economy back to where it was before World War I and Weimar.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>"},{"text":"In your book, you follow the story of a few main protagonists among the Third Reich’s financiers, industrialists, and weapons manufacturers, who exploited Nazi race policies and made huge fortunes. Could you describe the main practices that these people used to get what they wanted and make themselves the wealthiest and most powerful people in Nazi Germany?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"There were three ways to profit from the Nazi system. I already mentioned weapons production, which was not criminal, although it was forbidden under the Treaty of Versailles. But from 1935 onward, with the introduction of the Nuremberg race laws, you see the sliding scale that devolves into criminality with the disfranchisement and expropriation of Jewish business owners and families."},{"text":"Initially, it had this veneer of legality, where they coerced Jewish entrepreneurs to sign over their companies, for far below market value, to the men I write about. Or else these families wanted to sell their companies because they wanted to flee Nazi Germany. But then, as the 1930s go on, you see that it devolves into outright theft and robbery and seizure of Jewish-owned assets. They used the same practice in German-occupied territory across Europe, with business owners who were robbed just because the Germans had occupied their country. And the third way was the mass exploitation of forced and slave labor. After the German invasion into the Soviet Union in 1941, the mass deportation of forced and slave laborers from all across Europe to German factories and mines began. An estimated 12 to 20 million people were deported to work in Germany, and approximately 2.5 million people died due to the horrific working conditions in factories, mines, and labor camps.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>The most shocking part of this story is the exploitation of the prisoners from concentration camps as a slave workforce for the private companies. To what extent did these private companies use slave labor — and what were the working conditions?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"There were three ways German companies procured this labor. There were forced laborers who were mainly from Eastern Europe, who were deported by the millions through the German labor front, and paid much less than German laborers and kept in labor camps. Then there were prisoners of war. They were not paid. Thirdly, you had concentration camp labor. That was a collaboration of the SS with big companies like BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen, IG Farben, Siemens, Krupp, Dr. Oetker, and companies controlled by Günther Quandt and Friedrich Flick. These people were slaves, and the aim was to exterminate them through labor. These companies leased prisoners from the SS for four reichsmark per day for unskilled labor and six reichsmark per day for skilled labor. The SS built sub-concentration camps, or “satellite concentration camps,” as they were called, on factory complexes. These camps were guarded by the SS, and there was barely any medical attention and food for the captives. Prisoners were executed, hanged, or shot for the most minor infringements, and they were abused at their workplaces. They didn’t have any protective clothing, so they handled the machinery with their bare hands. There were the most awful working conditions you can imagine.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>"},{"text":"After the war, trials against the Nazi financial and industrial elite were prepared, and it seemed like justice would be done. But soon it turned out that almost none of the main culprits were sentenced to jail. Could you describe how the trials were initially set up and what determined the outcome of these trials?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"It’s important to distinguish between two things. First, there were the Nuremberg trials. The first and main Nuremberg trial was a major success, and it was focused on the top political and military protagonists of the Nazi regime. And there was the plan to hold trials against industrialists, which would be similar to the first main trial. But the Americans were worried that the Soviets would turn it into an anti-capitalist show trial. At the same time, the British and the French were so economically weak that they didn’t want to put<g> money </g>into another massive tribunal. The Americans decided to go at it alone and staged eleven trials at Nuremberg."},{"text":"Three of these trials were held against industrialists. They concerned Friedrich Flick and his managers, Alfred Krupp and his managers, and the entire executive board of IG Farben. Those trials were very well prepared, and justice was done. However, the American judges didn’t really get most of the dense evidentiary material, translated from German. The Americans limited the number of trials against industrialists because they didn’t want to put capitalism on trial. At that time, the Cold War was getting started, and the Americans made this policy decision where they wanted to rebuild West Germany as a democratically viable and economically strong state, which would act as a buffer against the Soviet Union and the encroachment of communism."},{"text":"I understand that policy decision, but where it went completely wrong, in my opinion, was when the Americans, British, and French handed over hundreds of thousands of suspected Nazi war criminals back to West German authorities for so-called denazification processes, which were very flawed legal trials that went on in western Germany between 1945 and 1950. It basically meant that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Germans went free for their crimes, because there was no interest on the German side to judge people on crimes that they themselves had committed and sympathies that they had held as well."},{"text":"The denazification of Germany is a myth. It never took place. There was a continuation of<g> money </g>and power from Nazi Germany to West Germany, and also, to an extent, in East Germany, because former SS officers became high-ranking Stasi and party officials. But it was far more pervasive in West Germany, where — in whatever part of society, whether business, legal, medical, academic, or media — there was no denazification.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>It’s shocking that the top leaders of Nazi Germany’s financial elite were allowed to continue doing business as usual.<span>David de Jong</span>Yes, totally. They were allowed to keep all their assets. Except, of course, apart from their assets located in Soviet-occupied East Germany, where the authorities expropriated them and took everything. But in West Germany, they were allowed to keep everything.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>As for the trials, I found it odd that investigators weren’t interested in the brutal practices of the industrialists like exploitation of forced slave labor and running subcamps near their factories. Why do you think that was the case?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"It was related to the fact that they didn’t want to put capitalism on trial. Similarly, that’s why they were allowed to keep all their assets, because business had to thrive in West Germany if they wanted it to be an effective buffer against the Soviet Union, and if Western Europe was to be revived again. I think the Americans were worried that, if they investigated the labor practices, it could turn against them, and they could be asked questions like, “OK, but what are you doing in your factories?” or “What about the exploitation of African Americans in your country?” That’s something they wanted to avoid at all costs.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>"},{"text":"It’s often said that Germany confronted its dark past. The student movement of the 1960s is frequently cited as the moment when German society started to ask difficult questions. After reading your book, I’m not so sure if German society was that successful in this respect. You mention that the first major backlash against the family of one of the most powerful industrialists in the Third Reich, Friedrich Flick, happened in the mid-1990s. And only in recent years does there seem to be a wider debate about history of other major Nazis who built their empires during the Third Reich and continued to do so after the war. Why do you think this is happening now and not much earlier, for instance when the Cold War ended?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"It’s because German business has never been forced to take any kind of moral responsibility for its crimes during the Third Reich. Sure, there were financial compensations, but they always negotiated that they didn’t have to admit any culpability or guilt for the crimes they committed. They paid money, but paying<g> money </g>is something different than actually coming out and taking responsibility for the actions in the past. The lack of responsibility has allowed these business families to sweep the history under the rug up to this day.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>So when we talk about how Germany managed to confront its past, do you think it’s a myth?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"If you look at a macro level then yes, they’ve reckoned with it pretty well. If you look on a micro level, nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody really wants to talk about what their grandparents did during World War II. This debate in the 1960s was more of a generational conflict. People who were born after the war became very critical toward power structures that were still in place. Very violent movements were formed from that debate, like the Rote Armee Fraktion, but they were mainly challenging the conservatism and the lack of historical reckoning that Germany had, which didn’t much occur in the business world, which was still a very conservative world. That reckoning really didn’t come until the 1990s or the 2000s. And in my opinion, it’s still far from being fulfilled.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>How did German society react to the findings that recently appeared in the newspapers about the dark Nazi past of certain billionaire companies?<span>David de Jong</span>The problem in Germany is that the public has become a little bit desensitized to revelations regarding its Nazi past. You notice that people are inundated with such revelations on a daily basis. They have become used to them, and they aren’t shocked.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>"},{"text":"Some of the families of former Nazi businessmen took public responsibility for the past following pressure from media and the public. In your book, you particularly mentioned the damage control by the Reimann family business as an example of how to deal with findings about a firm’s dark past. Why do you think the steps they took are the best way to deal with it?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"Because they’re transparent about the fact that their father and grandfather were committed Nazis. Also, they’ve renamed their foundation after their other grandfather, who turned out to be murdered in the Holocaust. My point is that there should be more of this historical transparency and taking responsibility for the past. But if you name your foundations after Herbert Quandt or Friedrich Flick or Ferdinand Porsche, who were committed Nazis or voluntary SS officers who committed war crimes on a large scale, than you can’t celebrate their business successes while leaving out their Nazi history.<span>Ondřej Bělíček</span>What reaction did you get from the public on your book?<span>David de Jong</span>"},{"text":"There have been two major developments since the book came out. First, the BMW foundation Herbert Quandt was inundated with angry letters from people who received<g> money </g>from that foundation but felt lied to because they had been given<g> money </g>in the name of a Nazi war criminal. So the foundation came out with a statement and<g> promised </g>change, but BMW is stuck between conservative shareholder Stefan Quandt, who honors his father, and angry foundation members, who are not very powerful but were very public about their anger. Second, Porsche is now negotiating with the heirs of Adolf Rosenberger, the company’s cofounder, who was pushed out of Porsche in 1935 and erased from Porsche company history for being Jewish. So they want to restore his place in Porsche company history. It’s also due to the fact that they have so many financial<g> interests </g>on the line right now, with the company going to the stock exchange and being valued at €80 billion, which is a massive amount."},{"text":"<a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/10/nazi-billionaires-businesses-denazification-de-jong-interview/\">SOURCE</a>"}],"summaries":[{"score":17.65,"text":"He promised to make them more money, but also to protect their interests, because it was a very unstable period.","index":6},{"score":21.863636363636363,"text":"It basically meant that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Germans went free for their crimes, because there was no interest on the German side to judge people on crimes that they themselves had committed and sympathies that they had held as well.","index":14},{"score":26.51304347826087,"text":"These people were slaves, and the aim was to exterminate them through labor.

Or else these families wanted to sell their companies because they wanted to flee Nazi Germany. But then, as the 1930s go on, you see that it devolves into outright theft and robbery and seizure of Jewish-owned assets. They used the same practice in German-occupied territory across Europe, with business owners who were robbed just because the Germans had occupied their country. And the third way was the mass exploitation of forced and slave labor. After the German invasion into the Soviet Union in 1941, the mass deportation of forced and slave laborers from all across Europe to German factories and mines began. An estimated 12 to 20 million people were deported to work in Germany, and approximately 2.5 million people died due to the horrific working conditions in factories, mines, and labor camps.Ondřej BělíčekThe most shocking part of this story is the exploitation of the prisoners from concentration camps as a slave workforce for the private companies. To what extent did these private companies use slave labor — and what were the working conditions?David de Jong","There were three ways German companies procured this labor. There were forced laborers who were mainly from Eastern Europe, who were deported by the millions through the German labor front, and paid much less than German laborers and kept in labor camps. Then there were prisoners of war. They were not paid. Thirdly, you had concentration camp labor. That was a collaboration of the SS with big companies like BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen, IG Farben, Siemens, Krupp, Dr. Oetker, and companies controlled by Günther Quandt and Friedrich Flick. These people were slaves, and the aim was to exterminate them through labor. These companies leased prisoners from the SS for four reichsmark per day for unskilled labor and six reichsmark per day for skilled labor. The SS built sub-concentration camps, or “satellite concentration camps,” as they were called, on factory complexes. These camps were guarded by the SS, and there was barely any medical attention and food for the captives. Prisoners were executed, hanged, or shot for the most minor infringements, and they were abused at their workplaces. They didn’t have any protective clothing, so they handled the machinery with their bare hands. There were the most awful working conditions you can imagine.Ondřej Bělíček","After the war, trials against the Nazi financial and industrial elite were prepared, and it seemed like justice would be done. But soon it turned out that almost none of the main culprits were sentenced to jail. Could you describe how the trials were initially set up and what determined the outcome of these trials?David de Jong","It’s important to distinguish between two things. First, there were the Nuremberg trials. The first and main Nuremberg trial was a major success, and it was focused on the top political and military protagonists of the Nazi regime. And there was the plan to hold trials against industrialists, which would be similar to the first main trial. But the Americans were worried that the Soviets would turn it into an anti-capitalist show trial. At the same time, the British and the French were so economically weak that they didn’t want to put money into another massive tribunal. The Americans decided to go at it alone and staged eleven trials at Nuremberg.","Three of these trials were held against industrialists. They concerned Friedrich Flick and his managers, Alfred Krupp and his managers, and the entire executive board of IG Farben. Those trials were very well prepared, and justice was done. However, the American judges didn’t really get most of the dense evidentiary material, translated from German. The Americans limited the number of trials against industrialists because they didn’t want to put capitalism on trial. At that time, the Cold War was getting started, and the Americans made this policy decision where they wanted to rebuild West Germany as a democratically viable and economically strong state, which would act as a buffer against the Soviet Union and the encroachment of communism.","I understand that policy decision, but where it went completely wrong, in my opinion, was when the Americans, British, and French handed over hundreds of thousands of suspected Nazi war criminals back to West German authorities for so-called denazification processes, which were very flawed legal trials that went on in western Germany between 1945 and 1950. It basically meant that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Germans went free for their crimes, because there was no interest on the German side to judge people on crimes that they themselves had committed and sympathies that they had held as well.","The denazification of Germany is a myth. It never took place. There was a continuation of money and power from Nazi Germany to West Germany, and also, to an extent, in East Germany, because former SS officers became high-ranking Stasi and party officials. But it was far more pervasive in West Germany, where — in whatever part of society, whether business, legal, medical, academic, or media — there was no denazification.Ondřej BělíčekIt’s shocking that the top leaders of Nazi Germany’s financial elite were allowed to continue doing business as usual.David de JongYes, totally. They were allowed to keep all their assets. Except, of course, apart from their assets located in Soviet-occupied East Germany, where the authorities expropriated them and took everything. But in West Germany, they were allowed to keep everything.Ondřej BělíčekAs for the trials, I found it odd that investigators weren’t interested in the brutal practices of the industrialists like exploitation of forced slave labor and running subcamps near their factories. Why do you think that was the case?David de Jong","It was related to the fact that they didn’t want to put capitalism on trial. Similarly, that’s why they were allowed to keep all their assets, because business had to thrive in West Germany if they wanted it to be an effective buffer against the Soviet Union, and if Western Europe was to be revived again. I think the Americans were worried that, if they investigated the labor practices, it could turn against them, and they could be asked questions like, “OK, but what are you doing in your factories?” or “What about the exploitation of African Americans in your country?” That’s something they wanted to avoid at all costs.Ondřej Bělíček","It’s often said that Germany confronted its dark past. The student movement of the 1960s is frequently cited as the moment when German society started to ask difficult questions. After reading your book, I’m not so sure if German society was that successful in this respect. You mention that the first major backlash against the family of one of the most powerful industrialists in the Third Reich, Friedrich Flick, happened in the mid-1990s. And only in recent years does there seem to be a wider debate about history of other major Nazis who built their empires during the Third Reich and continued to do so after the war. Why do you think this is happening now and not much earlier, for instance when the Cold War ended?David de Jong","It’s because German business has never been forced to take any kind of moral responsibility for its crimes during the Third Reich. Sure, there were financial compensations, but they always negotiated that they didn’t have to admit any culpability or guilt for the crimes they committed. They paid money, but paying money is something different than actually coming out and taking responsibility for the actions in the past. The lack of responsibility has allowed these business families to sweep the history under the rug up to this day.Ondřej BělíčekSo when we talk about how Germany managed to confront its past, do you think it’s a myth?David de Jong","If you look at a macro level then yes, they’ve reckoned with it pretty well. If you look on a micro level, nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody really wants to talk about what their grandparents did during World War II. This debate in the 1960s was more of a generational conflict. People who were born after the war became very critical toward power structures that were still in place. Very violent movements were formed from that debate, like the Rote Armee Fraktion, but they were mainly challenging the conservatism and the lack of historical reckoning that Germany had, which didn’t much occur in the business world, which was still a very conservative world. That reckoning really didn’t come until the 1990s or the 2000s. And in my opinion, it’s still far from being fulfilled.Ondřej BělíčekHow did German society react to the findings that recently appeared in the newspapers about the dark Nazi past of certain billionaire companies?David de JongThe problem in Germany is that the public has become a little bit desensitized to revelations regarding its Nazi past. You notice that people are inundated with such revelations on a daily basis. They have become used to them, and they aren’t shocked.Ondřej Bělíček","Some of the families of former Nazi businessmen took public responsibility for the past following pressure from media and the public. In your book, you particularly mentioned the damage control by the Reimann family business as an example of how to deal with findings about a firm’s dark past. Why do you think the steps they took are the best way to deal with it?David de Jong","Because they’re transparent about the fact that their father and grandfather were committed Nazis. Also, they’ve renamed their foundation after their other grandfather, who turned out to be murdered in the Holocaust. My point is that there should be more of this historical transparency and taking responsibility for the past. But if you name your foundations after Herbert Quandt or Friedrich Flick or Ferdinand Porsche, who were committed Nazis or voluntary SS officers who committed war crimes on a large scale, than you can’t celebrate their business successes while leaving out their Nazi history.Ondřej BělíčekWhat reaction did you get from the public on your book?David de Jong","There have been two major developments since the book came out. First, the BMW foundation Herbert Quandt was inundated with angry letters from people who received money from that foundation but felt lied to because they had been given money in the name of a Nazi war criminal. So the foundation came out with a statement and promised change, but BMW is stuck between conservative shareholder Stefan Quandt, who honors his father, and angry foundation members, who are not very powerful but were very public about their anger. Second, Porsche is now negotiating with the heirs of Adolf Rosenberger, the company’s cofounder, who was pushed out of Porsche in 1935 and erased from Porsche company history for being Jewish. So they want to restore his place in Porsche company history. It’s also due to the fact that they have so many financial interests on the line right now, with the company going to the stock exchange and being valued at €80 billion, which is a massive amount."],"catagory":"history","url":"https://jacobin.com/2022/10/nazi-billionaires-businesses-denazification-de-jong-interview/","images":[]},{"image":"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_0,w_1844,h_1035/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill,g_faces/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1667050325/39-1026906635c25f4ced74","title":"Viking-era sword, jewellery and large grave field discovered in southern Finland","slides":[{"text":"A local resident in Janakkala came across a Viking-era<g> sword </g>while clearing undergrowth in his forest, leading to the discovery of more artifacts and an extensive Iron Age<g> grave </g>field."},{"text":"In mid-October <strong>Reijo Hyvönen</strong>, a member of a regional history association in the Häme region (known as Kanta-Hämeen menneisyyden etsijät), received a message and a photograph from a couple of landowners he knows in Janakkala, just south of Hämeenlinna, who said they had found a sword."},{"text":"\"They asked what to do now, after finding a complete<g> sword </g>while working in the forest.
